TI  == maternal fucosyltransferase 2 status affects the gut bifidobacterial communities  of breastfed infants.
AB  == background: individuals with inactive alleles of the fucosyltransferase 2 gene (fut2; termed the 'secretor' gene) are common in many populations. some members of the genus bifidobacterium, common infant gut commensals, are known to consume  2'-fucosylated glycans found in the breast milk of secretor mothers. we investigated the effects of maternal secretor status on the developing infant microbiota with a special emphasis on bifidobacterial species abundance. results: on average, bifidobacteria were established earlier and more often in infants fed by secretor mothers than in infants fed by non-secretor mothers. in secretor-fed  infants, the relative abundance of the bifidobacterium longum group was most strongly correlated with high percentages of the order bifidobacteriales. conversely, in non-secretor-fed infants, bifidobacterium breve was positively correlated with bifidobacteriales, while the b. longum group was negatively correlated. a higher percentage of bifidobacteria isolated from secretor-fed infants consumed 2'-fucosyllactose. infant feces with high levels of bifidobacteria had lower milk oligosaccharide levels in the feces and higher amounts of lactate. furthermore, feces containing different bifidobacterial species possessed differing amounts of oligosaccharides, suggesting differential  consumption in situ. conclusions: infants fed by non-secretor mothers are delayed in the establishment of a bifidobacteria-laden microbiota. this delay may be due  to difficulties in the infant acquiring a species of bifidobacteria able to consume the specific milk oligosaccharides delivered by the mother. this work provides mechanistic insight into how milk glycans enrich specific beneficial bacterial populations in infants and reveals clues for enhancing enrichment of bifidobacterial populations in at risk populations - such as premature infants.

TI  == the neonatal gut harbours distinct bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == background: recent studies have described the bifidobacterial composition of neonates at a species level; however, with advancing technologies we can gain insight into the diversity of the bifidobacterial microbiota residing within the  infant gut. objective: to compare species and strain diversity of culturable bifidobacterial populations in faecal samples obtained from healthy term infants  on three different feeding regimes. study design: in total, 51 healthy term infants were recruited for this study and divided equally into three different groups (n=17) based on their feeding regime during the first 4 weeks of life. culturable bifidobacterial populations were analysed at week 1, week 4 and 6 months of age. isolates were characterised to species level by 16s rrna-internally transcribed spacer (its) gene sequence analysis and to strain level by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: in total,173 bifidobacterial strains were detected across all three groups from 2295 isolates, 42% (72 of 173) of which were detected in the prebiotic-fed group, followed by 30% (52 of 173) and 28% (49 of 173) in the breastfed and non-prebiotic-fed groups, respectively. surprisingly, only two of the 51 infants harboured an identical bifidobacterial strain which was not present in the other 49 infants. prebiotic supplementation in the early neonatal period increased the prevalence of bifidobacterium longum in infants, in addition to promoting strain diversity.  b. longum was the dominant species recovered from all three groups during the first 6 months of life, followed by bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium bifidum. conclusions: this study reveals a hitherto unknown level of diversity at the strain level among bifidobacteria isolated from different infants and the influence prebiotic formula feeding has on the bifidobacterial population.

TI  == a novel lactobacillus casei lp1 producing 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a bifidogenic growth stimulator.
AB  == 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (dhna) is a bifidogenic growth stimulator (bgs) and could be a functional food ingredient since bifidobacteria are beneficial for human health. for that reason, lactic acid bacteria producing dhna have been screened. a lactic acid bacterium lp1 strain isolated from a natural cheese was confirmed to produce dhna, analyzed by a hplc method. the strain was identified as lactobacillus casei by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the cell-free supernatant of fermented whey produced by l. casei lp1 presented the bgs activity for three bifidobacterial strains such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  kctc 3127, bifidobacterium bifidum kctc 3202, and bifidobacterium breve kctc 3220 which were human-originated. to the best of our knowledge, a l. casei strain which can produce dhna was firstly identified in this study.

TI  == multilocus sequence typing of bifidobacterial strains from infant's faeces and human milk: are bifidobacteria being sustainably shared during breastfeeding?
AB  == bifidobacteria are considered to be one of the most important beneficial intestinal bacteria for infants, contributing to the priming of the mucosal immune system. these microbes can also be detected in mother's milk, suggesting a potential role of human milk in the colonisation of infant's gut. however, little is known about the timing of bacteria appearance in human milk, and whether human milk is the first source of inoculation. here, we investigated whether specific strains are shared sustainably between maternal milk and infant's gut. faecal samples and human milk were collected from 102 healthy mother-infant pairs (infant's faeces: meconium, 7, 30 days of age; mother's milk: once before delivery, colostrum, 7, 30 days after delivery). bifidobacterial strains were isolated from these samples, and were discriminated by means of multilocus sequencing typing. no bifidobacteria were detected from human milk collected before delivery, or colostrum. strains were isolated only from human milk samples obtained 7 days after birth or later. on the other hand, bifidobacterial strains  were obtained from infant's faeces throughout the study period, sometimes as early as the first day of life (meconium). we have found that bifidobacterial species belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum could be identified as monophyletic between  infant's faeces and their mother's milk. these strains were confirmed to be sustainably shared between maternal milk and infant's gut. moreover, monophyletic strains were isolated at the same time point or earlier from infant's faeces than from human milk, and none were isolated earlier from human milk than from infant's faeces. although it remains unclear whether human milk is the first source of microbes for infants, our results confirm that human milk is a reservoir of bifidobacteria, and specific strains are shared between infant's intestine and human milk during breastfeeding.

TI  == relationship between acid tolerance and cell membrane in bifidobacterium, revealed by comparative analysis of acid-resistant derivatives and their parental strains grown in medium with and without tween 80.
AB  == the acid tolerance is particularly important for bifidobacteria to function as probiotics because they usually encounter acidic environments in food products and gastrointestinal tract passage. in this study, two acid-resistant derivatives bifidobacterium longum jdy1017dph and bifidobacterium breve bb8dph, which displayed a stable acid-resistant phenotype, were generated. the relationship between acid tolerance and cell membrane was investigated by comparing the two acid-resistant derivatives and their parental strains grown in medium with and without tween 80. the fold increase in acid tolerance of the two acid-resistant derivatives relative to their parental strains was much higher when cells were grown in medium with tween 80 (10(4) ~ 10(5)-fold) than without tween 80 (181- and 245-fold). moreover, when cells were grown in medium with tween 80, the two acid-resistant derivatives exhibited more c18:1 and cycc19:0, higher mean fatty acid chain length, lower membrane fluidity, and higher expression of cfa gene encoding cyclopropane fatty acid synthase than their parental strains. no significant differences in cell membrane were observed between the two acid-resistant derivatives and their parental strains when cells were grown in medium without tween 80. the present study revealed that, when cells were grown in medium with tween 80, the significant fold increase in acid tolerance of the two acid-resistant derivatives was mainly ascribed to the pronounced changes in cell membrane compared with their parental strains. results presented here could  provide a basis for developing new strategies of cell membrane modification to enhance acid tolerance in bifidobacteria.

TI  == improving survival of probiotic bacteria using bacterial poly-gamma-glutamic acid.
AB  == a major hurdle in producing a useful probiotic food product is bacterial survival during storage and ingestion. the aim of this study was to test the effect of gamma-pga immobilisation on the survival of probiotic bacteria when stored in acidic fruit juice. fruit juices provide an alternative means of probiotic delivery, especially to lactose intolerant individuals. in addition, the survival of gamma-pga-immobilised cells in simulated gastric juice was also assessed. bifidobacteria strains (bifidobacteria longum, bifidobacteria breve), immobilised on 2.5% gamma-pga, survived significantly better (p<0.05) in orange and pomegranate juice for 39 and 11 days respectively, compared to free cells. however, cells survived significantly better (p<0.05) when stored in orange juice compared to pomegranate juice. moreover, both strains, when protected with 2.5% gamma-pga, survived in simulated gastric juice (ph2.0) with a marginal reduction  (<0.47 log cfu/ml) or no significant reduction in viable cells after 4h, whereas  free cells died within 2h. in conclusion, this research indicates that gamma-pga  can be used to protect bifidobacteria cells in fruit juice, and could also help improve the survival of cells as they pass through the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (git). following our previous report on the use of gamma-pga as a cryoprotectant for probiotic bacteria, this research further suggests that gamma-pga could be used to improve probiotic survival during the various stages of preparation, storage and ingestion of probiotic cells.

TI  == discovery of a conjugative megaplasmid in bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve is a common and sometimes very abundant inhabitant of the human gut. genome sequencing of b. breve jcm 7017 revealed the presence of an extrachromosomal element, designated pmp7017 consisting of >190 kb, thus representing the first reported bifidobacterial megaplasmid. in silico characterization of this element revealed several genomic features supporting a stable establishment of the megaplasmid in its host, illustrated by predicted crispr-cas functions that are known to protect the host against intrusion of foreign dna. interestingly, pmp7017 is also predicted to encode a conjugative dna transfer apparatus and, consistent with this notion, we demonstrate here the conjugal transfer of pmp7017 to representative strains of b. breve and b. longum  subsp. longum. we also demonstrate the presence of a megaplasmid with homology to pmp7017 in three b. longum subsp. longum strains.

TI  == monoculture parameters successfully predict coculture growth kinetics of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and two bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == microorganisms rarely live in isolation but are most often found in a consortium. this provides the potential for cross-feeding and nutrient competition among the  microbial species, which make it challenging to predict the growth kinetics in coculture. in this paper we developed a mathematical model to describe substrate  consumption and subsequent microbial growth and metabolite production for bacteria grown in monoculture. the model characterized substrate utilization kinetics of 18 bifidobacterium strains. some bifidobacterial strains demonstrated preferential degradation of oligofructose in that sugars with low degree of polymerization (dp) (dp</=3 or 4) were metabolized before sugars of higher dp, or vice versa. thus, we expanded the model to describe the preferential degradation  of oligofructose. in addition, we adapted the model to describe the competition between human colonic bacteria bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262 and bifidobacterium longum lmg 11047 or bifidobacterium breve yakult for inulin as well as cross-feeding of breakdown products from the extracellular hydrolysis of  inulin by b. thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262. we found that the coculture growth kinetics could be predicted based on the respective monoculture growth kinetics.  using growth kinetics from monoculture experiments to predict coculture dynamics  will reduce the number of in vitro experiments required to parameterize multi-culture models.

TI  == bifidobacteria exert strain-specific effects on stress-related behavior and physiology in balb/c mice.
AB  == background: accumulating evidence suggests that commensal bacteria consumption has the potential to have a positive impact on stress-related psychiatric disorders. however, the specific bacteria influencing behaviors related to anxiety and depression remain unclear. to this end, we compared the effects of two different bifidobacteria on anxiety and depression-like behavior; an antidepressant was also used as a comparator. methods: innately anxious balb/c mice received daily bifidobacterium longum (b.) 1714, b. breve 1205, the antidepressant escitalopram or vehicle treatment for 6 weeks. behavior was assessed in stress-induced hyperthermia test, marble burying, elevated plus maze, open field, tail suspension test, and forced swim test. physiological responses to acute stress were also assessed. key results: both bifidobacteria and escitalopram reduced anxiety in the marble burying test; however, only b. longum  1714 decreased stress-induced hyperthermia. b. breve 1205 induced lower anxiety in the elevated plus maze whereas b. longum 1714 induced antidepressant-like behavior in the tail suspension test. however, there was no difference in corticosterone levels between groups. conclusions & inferences: these data show that these two bifidobacteria strains reduced anxiety in an anxious mouse strain. these results also suggest that each bacterial strain has intrinsic effects and may be beneficially specific for a given disorder. these findings strengthen the  role of gut microbiota supplementation as psychobiotic-based strategies for stress-related brain-gut axis disorders, opening new avenues in the field of neurogastroenterology.

TI  == mupirocin-mucin agar for selective enumeration of bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a bacterial species exclusively found in the human intestinal tract. this species is becoming increasingly popular as a probiotic organism added to lyophilized products. in this study, porcine mucin was used as  the sole carbon source for the selective enumeration of b. bifidum in probiotic food additives. thirty-six bifidobacterial strains were cultivated in broth with  mucin. only 13 strains of b. bifidum utilized the mucin to produce acids. b. bifidum was selectively enumerated in eight probiotic food supplements using agar (mm agar) containing mupirocin (100 mg/l) and mucin (20 g/l) as the sole carbon source. mm agar was fully selective if the b. bifidum species was presented together with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, bifidobacterium breve, and  bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum species and with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli, streptococci). isolated strains of b. bifidum were identified using biochemical, pcr, maldi-tof procedures and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the novel selective medium was also suitable for the isolation of b. bifidum strains  from human fecal samples.

TI  == effects of bifidobacterial supplementation to pregnant women and infants in the prevention of allergy development in infants and on fecal microbiota.
AB  == background: probiotic administration may be a useful method for preventing allergies in infants; however, there have been controversial results about the efficacy. we investigated the effects of bifidobacterial supplementation on the risk of developing allergic diseases in the japanese population. methods: in an open trial, we gave bifidobacterium breve m-16v and bifidobacterium longum bb536  prenatally to 130 mothers beginning 1 month prior to delivery and postnatally to  their infants for 6 months. another 36 mother-infant pairs served as controls and did not receive the bifidobacterial supplementation. development of allergic symptoms in the infants was assessed at 4, 10 and 18 months of age. fecal samples were collected from the mothers and infants. results: the risk of developing eczema/atopic dermatitis (ad) during the first 18 months of life was significantly reduced in infants in the probiotic group (or: 0.231 [95% ci: 0.084-0.628] and 0.304 [0.105-0.892] at 10 and 18 months of age, respectively). pyrosequencing analyses indicated an altered composition of the fecal microbiota  at 4 months for infants who developed eczema/ad at 4 and 10 months of age. the proportion of proteobacteria was significantly lower (p = 0.007) in mothers at the time of delivery who received the supplementation when compared with the control group and was positively correlated (r = 0.283, p = 0.024) with that of infants at 4 months of age. no adverse effects were related to the use of probiotics. conclusions: these data suggest that the prenatal and postnatal supplementation of bifidobacteria is effective in primary preventing allergic diseases. some limited changes in the composition of fecal microbiota by the bifidobacterial supplementation were observed.

TI  == bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve isolates from preterm and full term neonates: comparison of cell surface properties.
AB  == we compared autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity and caco-2 cells adhesion capabilities of independent bifidobacterium breve (n = 22) and bifidobacterium longum (n = 25) strains isolated from preterm (n = 20) and full term neonates (n  = 27). concerning strains properties, a correlation between autoaggregation and surface hydrophobicity was found for b. longum (r = 0.40, p = 0.048), b. breve (r = 0.57, p = 0.005), and all strains independently of the species consideration (r = 0.46, p = 0.001). the absence of difference in adhesion capabilities between preterm and full term neonate strains suggests a strain-dependent property. however, b. longum strains from preterm neonates (n = 10) showed higher autoaggregation ability (p = 0.044). additionally, independently of species consideration, preterm neonates strains showed lower surface hydrophobicity (p =  0.027). as far as species are considered, preterm neonate b. breve strains (n = 10) showed significantly lower surface hydrophobicity percentages (p = 0.043). our results suggest the existence of variations in bifidobacteria membrane structure and/or composition that may reflect adaptation of these bacteria to the intestinal environment of either preterm or full term neonates. such information  is of interest when considering the use of bifidobacteria probiotic strains for modulation of preterm neonates gut microbiota.

TI  == anaerobic green fluorescent protein as a marker of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == some strains of bifidobacterium are considered as probiotics and are being added  as adjunct culture in food products due to their potential in maintaining a healthy intestinal microbial balance. however, despite these benefits, bifidobacteria still remain poorly understood at the genetic level compared with  other microorganisms of industrial interest. in this work, we have developed a non-invasive green fluorescent based reporter system for real-time tracking of bifidobacterium species in vivo. the reporter vector pnz:tu-gfpana is based on the pnz8048 plasmid harboring a bifidobacterial promoter (elongation factor tu from bifidobacterium longum cect 4551) and a fluorescent protein containing a flavin-mono-nucleotide-based cofactor (evoglow-pp1) which is fluorescent under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. pnz:tu-gfpana was constructed and found to stably replicate in b. longum cect 4551 and in the intestinal strain bifidobacterium breve inia p734. the subsequent analysis of these strains allowed us to assess the functionality of this plasmid. our results demonstrate the potential of pnz:tu-gfpana as a real-time reporter system for bifidobacterium in  order to track the behavior of this probiotic species in complex environments like food or intestinal microbiota, and to estimate their competition and colonization potential.

TI  == in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of selected oxalate-degrading probiotic bacteria: potential applications in the prevention and treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  == oxalate (ox) is a very common component of the human diet, capable to collect in  the renal tissue and bind calcium to form calcium oxalate (caox) crystals. a supersaturation of caox crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. the inflammation derived from the caox crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. in this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative  approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of rp-hplc-uv method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. four promising bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus acidophilus la-14, bifidobacterium breve pbs077, bifidobacterium longum pbs078) were identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention  and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the ox accumulation. practical application: the oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic  approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state.

TI  == cohort study of probiotics in a north american neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm  infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) without adverse consequences. study design: since the end of july 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. we give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus ha-111 [corrected] (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. we compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months. results: two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in nec (from 9.8% to 5.4%, p < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or nec (from 17% to 10.5%, p < .05). after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (or for nec, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.26-0.98; or for death or nec, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.33-0.93). there was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection. discussion: a product that is readily available in north america, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of nec in our neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == bifidobacteria: their impact on gut microbiota composition and their applications as probiotics in infants.
AB  == this review is aimed at describing the most recent advances in the gut microbiota composition of newborns and infants with a particular emphasis on bifidobacteria. the newborn gut microbiota is quite unstable, whereas after weaning, it becomes more stable and gets closer to the typical adult microbiota. the newborn and infant gut microbiota composition is impaired in several enteric and non-enteric  pathologies. the core of this review is the description of the most recent documented applications of bifidobacteria to newborns and infants for their prevention and treatment. acute diarrhea is the most studied disease for which bifidobacteria are applied with great success, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve being the most applied species. moreover, the most recent updates in the use of bifidobacteria for the prevention and treatment of pathologies typical of newborns, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, colics, and streptococcal infections, are presented. in addition, a number of not strictly enteric pathologies have in recent years evidenced a strict correlation with an aberrant gut microbiota in infants, in particular showing a reduced level of bifidobacteria. these diseases represent new potential opportunities for probiotic applications. among them, allergic diseases, celiac disease, obesity, and neurologic diseases are described in this review. the preliminary use of bifidobacteria in in vitro systems and animal models is summarized as well as preliminary in vivo studies. only after validation of the results via human clinical trials will the potentiality of bifidobacteria in the prevention and cure of these pathologies be definitely assessed.

TI  == interactions between bifidobacterium and bacteroides species in cofermentations are affected by carbon sources, including exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacteria.
AB  == cocultures of strains from two bifidobacterium and two bacteroides species were performed with exopolysaccharides (eps) previously purified from bifidobacteria,  with inulin, or with glucose as the carbon source. bifidobacterium longum nb667 and bifidobacterium breve ipla20004 grew in glucose but showed poor or no growth  in complex carbohydrates (inulin, eps e44, and eps r1), whereas bacteroides grew  well in the four carbon sources tested. in the presence of glucose, the growth of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron dsm-2079 was inhibited by b. breve, whereas it remained unaffected in the presence of b. longum. ba. fragilis dsm-2151 contributed to a greater survival of b. longum, promoting changes in the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and organic acids in coculture with respect to monocultures. in complex carbohydrates, cocultures of bifidobacterium  strains with ba. thetaiotaomicron did not modify the behavior of bacteroides nor  improve the poor growth of bifidobacteria. the metabolic activity of ba. fragilis in coculture with bifidobacteria was not affected by eps, but greater survival of bifidobacteria at late stages of incubation occurred in cocultures than in monocultures, leading to a higher production of acetic acid than in monocultures. therefore, cocultures of bifidobacterium and bacteroides can behave differently against fermentable carbohydrates as a function of the specific characteristics of the strains from each species. these results stress the importance of considering specific species and strain interactions and not simply higher taxonomic divisions in the relationship among intestinal microbial populations and their different responses to probiotics and prebiotics.

TI  == effect of administration of bifidobacteria on intestinal microbiota in low-birth-weight infants and transition of administered bifidobacteria: a comparison between one-species and three-species administration.
AB  == the effects of administration of bifidobacteria on the intestinal microbiota in low-birth-weight infants, and the transition of each strain of administered bifidobacteria were investigated. a single strain of bifidobacterium breve m-16v  (5 x 10(8); one-species group) or a mixture of three species composed of b. breve m-16v, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis m-63 and b. longum subsp. longum bb536 (5 x 10(8) of each strain; three-species group) were administered daily for 6 weeks. bifidobacterial administration significantly increased the detection rates and cell numbers of bifidobacteria in the feces (weeks 1-6). the proportion of bifidobacteria was significantly higher in the one-species group at weeks 1-4, and in the three-species group at weeks 1-6 compared with the control group. furthermore, the proportion of bifidobacteria in the three-species group was significantly higher than that in the one-species group at weeks 1 and 6. the proportion of infants with bifidobacteria-predominant microbiota was significantly higher in the three-species group than in the control group during  the test period. the detection rates of clostridium were lower in the bifidobacteria-administered groups. the proportions of enterobacteriaceae were significantly lower in the three-species group compared to the other groups (weeks 4 and 6). among the three strains administered, b. breve m-16v and bifidobacterium infantis m-63 were detected in 85% or more of the infants during  the administration period, while b. longum bb536 was detected in 40% or less. compared with administration of one species, administration of three species of bifidobacteria resulted in earlier formation of a bifidobacteria-predominant fecal microbiota and maintenance of this microbiota.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

AB  == human milk contains a high concentration of complex oligosaccharides that influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants. previous studies have indicated that select species such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum can utilize human milk oligosaccharides (hmo) in vitro as the sole carbon source, while the relatively few b. longum subsp. longum and bifidobacterium breve isolates tested appear less adapted to these substrates. considering the high frequency at which b. breve is  isolated from breast-fed infant feces, we postulated that some b. breve strains can more vigorously consume hmo and thus are enriched in the breast-fed infant gastrointestinal tract. to examine this, a number of b. breve isolates from breast-fed infant feces were characterized for the presence of different glycosyl hydrolases that participate in hmo utilization, as well as by their ability to grow on hmo or specific hmo species such as lacto-n-tetraose (lnt) and fucosyllactose. all b. breve strains showed high levels of growth on lnt and lacto-n-neotetraose (lnnt), and, in general, growth on total hmo was moderate for most of the strains, with several strain differences. growth and consumption of fucosylated hmo were strain dependent, mostly in isolates possessing a glycosyl hydrolase family 29 alpha-fucosidase. glycoprofiling of the spent supernatant after hmo fermentation by select strains revealed that all b. breve strains can utilize sialylated hmo to a certain extent, especially sialyl-lacto-n-tetraose. interestingly, this specific oligosaccharide was depleted before neutral lnt by strain sc95. in aggregate, this work indicates that the hmo consumption phenotype in b. breve is variable; however, some strains display specific adaptations to these substrates, enabling more vigorous consumption of fucosylated and sialylated hmo. these results provide a rationale for the predominance of this species in breast-fed infant feces and contribute to a more accurate picture of the ecology of the developing infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == differential modulation of human intestinal bifidobacterium populations after consumption of a wild blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) drink.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gaining increasing interest as health-promoting bacteria. nonetheless, the genus comprises several species, which can exert different effects on human host. previous studies showed that wild blueberry drink consumption could selectively increase intestinal bifidobacteria, suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. this study evaluated the modulation of the most common and abundant bifidobacterial taxonomic groups inhabiting the human gut in the same fecal samples. the analyses carried out showed that b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. catenulatum/pseudocatelulatum, and b. longum subsp. longum were always present in the group of subjects enrolled, whereas b. bifidum and b. longum subsp. infantis  were not. furthermore, it was found that the most predominant bifidobacterial species were b. longum subsp. longum and b. adolescentis. the results obtained revealed a high interindividual variability; however, a significant increase of b. longum subsp. infantis cell concentration was observed in the feces of volunteers after the wild blueberry drink treatment. this bifidobacterial group was shown to possess immunomodulatory abilities and to relieve symptoms and promote the regression of several gastrointestinal disorders. thus, an increased  cell concentration of b. longum subsp. infantis in the human gut could be considered of potential health benefit. in conclusion, wild blueberry consumption resulted in a specific bifidogenic effect that could positively affect certain populations of bifidobacteria with demonstrated health-promoting properties.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == bacillus subtilis natto: a non-toxic source of poly-gamma-glutamic acid that could be used as a cryoprotectant for probiotic bacteria.
AB  == it is common practice to freeze dry probiotic bacteria to improve their shelf life. however, the freeze drying process itself can be detrimental to their viability. the viability of probiotics could be maintained if they are administered within a microbially produced biodegradable polymer - poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-pga) - matrix. although the antifreeze activity of gamma-pga is well known, it has not been used for maintaining the viability of probiotic bacteria during freeze drying. the aim of this study was to test the effect of gamma-pga (produced by b. subtilis natto atcc 15245) on the viability of probiotic bacteria during freeze drying and to test the toxigenic potential of b. subtilis natto. 10% gamma-pga was found to protect lactobacillus paracasei significantly better than 10% sucrose, whereas it showed comparable cryoprotectant activity to sucrose when it was used to protect bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. although gamma-pga is known to be non-toxic, it is crucial to ascertain the toxigenic potential of its source, b. subtilis natto. presence of six genes that are known to encode for toxins were investigated: three component hemolysin (hbl d/a), three component non-haemolytic enterotoxin (nheb), b. cereus enterotoxin t (bcet), enterotoxin fm (entfm), sphingomyelinase  (sph) and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase (piplc). from our investigations, none of these six genes were present in b. subtilis natto. moreover, haemolytic and lecithinase activities were found to be absent. our work contributes a biodegradable polymer from a non-toxic source for the cryoprotection of probiotic bacteria, thus improving their survival during the manufacturing process.

TI  == perinatal pet exposure, faecal microbiota, and wheezy bronchitis: is there a connection?
AB  == background. the hygiene hypothesis suggests that high hygiene standards have led  to an immune dysfunction and an increase in allergic diseases. farming-related exposures are associated with a decreased risk of asthma. since the gut microbiota may be a pivotal component in the hygiene hypothesis, we studied whether perinatal exposure to pets, doctor's diagnosed wheezy bronchitis (wb), and compositional changes in the gut microbiota are interrelated among urban infants. methods. data were collected prospectively from a mother-infant nutrition study. data on perinatal pet ownership, wb, and the microbiota composition of faecal samples of the infants assessed by quantitative pcr at 1 month were compared. results. none of the 30 infants exposed to pets had suffered from wb by 24 months, whereas 15 of the 99 (15%) nonexposed infants had had wb (p = 0.03). the counts of bifidobacterium longum were higher in samples (n = 17) from nonwheezing infants with pet exposure compared to those (n = 10) in wheezing infants without pet exposure (8.59/10.44 versus 5.94/9.86, resp. (median/upper limit of range, bacteria(log)/g of stool); p = 0.02). b. breve was more abundant  in the wheezing infants (p = 0.02).

TI  == tolerance of bifidobacterium human isolates to bile, acid and oxygen.
AB  == bifidobacteria are part of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and are used as  probiotics in functional food products because of their health promoting properties. however, only few data are available on the phenotypic characteristics displayed by human bifidobacteria strain populations. in this study we compared the in vitro tolerance to acid, bile and oxygen of the largest  number of independent human intestinal strains. bile and acid tolerance varied among species and independent strains within a species: b. adolescentis strains were the most tolerant to bile followed by bifidobacterium longum and b. breve; b. longum, b. breve and b. dentium showed the highest viability levels after exposure to acid ph. oxygen tolerance was largely distributed among intestinal bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. breve and b. bifidum showed the highest oxygen tolerance. b. adolescentis showed the highest susceptibility to acid and oxygen stresses. the present study gave us the opportunity to update our knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of human intestinal bifidobacteria. b. longum and  b. breve harboured the best tolerance to oxygen, bile and acid stresses. based on such biological characters, b. longum and b. breve species showed the highest interest in terms of potential selection of human probiotics.

TI  == immunoregulatory effect of bifidobacteria strains in porcine intestinal epithelial cells through modulation of ubiquitin-editing enzyme a20 expression.
AB  == background: we previously showed that evaluation of anti-inflammatory activities  of lactic acid bacteria in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells is useful for selecting potentially immunobiotic strains. objective: the aims of the present study were: i) to select potentially immunomodulatory bifidobacteria that beneficially modulate the toll-like receptor (tlr)-4-triggered inflammatory response in pie cells and; ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotics by evaluating the role  of tlr2 and tlr negative regulators in the modulation of proinflammatory cytokine production and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and nuclear  factor-kappab (nf-kappab) pathways in pie cells. results: bifidobacteria longum bb536 and b. breve m-16v strains significantly downregulated levels of interleukin (il)-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 and il-6 in pie cells challenged with heat-killed enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. moreover, bb536 and m-16v strains attenuated the proinflammatory response by modulating the nf-kappab and mapk pathways. in addition, our findings provide evidence for a key role for  the ubiquitin-editing enzyme a20 in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotic  bifidobacteria in pie cells. conclusions: we show new data regarding the mechanism involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotics. several strains with immunoregulatory capabilities used a common mechanism to induce tolerance in pie cells. immunoregulatory strains interacted with tlr2, upregulated the expression of a20 in pie cells, and beneficially modulated the subsequent tlr4 activation by reducing the activation of mapk and nf-kappab pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. we also show that the combination of tlr2 activation and a20 induction can be used as biomarkers to screen and select potential immunoregulatory bifidobacteria strains.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == comparison of the compositions of the stool microbiotas of infants fed goat milk  formula, cow milk-based formula, or breast milk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. one factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8, cxcl-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. the purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. il-8 gene expression and protein production in ht-29 cells were evaluated by real-time pcr  and elisa, respectively. pre-incubation of ht-29 cells with lactobacillus kefir im002, bifidobacterium adolescentis frp 61, bifidobacterium longum frp 68 and frp 69, bifidobacterium breve frp 334, and leuconostoc mesenteroides im080 significantly inhibited il-8 secretion induced by salmonella typhimurium dt104. co-culture of selected probiotics and salmonella typhimurium dt104 reduced il-8 production, while potential probiotics and lab had no effect on il-8 secretion in ht-29 cells preincubated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 prior to adding probiotics. lactobacillus kefir im002 supernatant also significantly reduced il-8 production. in conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and lab modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  == bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the  immune system. despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human  populations. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, b. breve, and b. longum. due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. negative correlations between the b. longum group and b. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between b. longum and b. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. the highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.

TI  == identification and accurate quantitation of biological oligosaccharide mixtures.
AB  == structure-specific characterization and quantitation is often required for effective functional studies of oligosaccharides. inside the gut, hmos are preferentially bound and catabolized by the beneficial bacteria. hmo utility by these bacteria employs structure-specific catabolism based on a number of glycosidases. determining the activity of these enzymes requires accurate quantitation of a large number of structures. in this study, we describe a method for the quantitation of human milk oligosaccharide (hmo) structures employing lc/ms and isotopically labeled internal standards. data analysis was accomplished with a newly developed software tool, lc/ms searcher, that employs a reference structure library to process lc/ms data yielding structural identification with accurate quantitation. the method was used to obtain a meta-enzyme analysis of bacteria, the simultaneous characterization of all glycosidases employed by bacteria for the catabolism of milk oligosaccharides. analysis of consumed hmo structures confirmed the utility of a beta-1,3-galactosidase in bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697 (b. infantis). in comparison, bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700 showed significantly less hmo catabolic activity compared to b.  infantis.

TI  == endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidases from infant gut-associated bifidobacteria release complex n-glycans from human milk glycoproteins.
AB  == breastfeeding is one of the main factors guiding the composition of the infant gut microbiota in the first months of life. this process is shaped in part by the high amounts of human milk oligosaccharides that serve as a carbon source for saccharolytic bacteria such as bifidobacterium species. infant-borne bifidobacteria have developed various molecular strategies for utilizing these oligosaccharides as a carbon source. we hypothesized that these species also interact with n-glycans found in host glycoproteins that are structurally similar to free oligosaccharides in human milk. endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidases were identified in certain isolates of bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, and bifidobacterium breve, and their presence correlated with the ability of these strains to deglycosylate glycoproteins. an endoglycosidase from b. infantis atcc 15697, endobi-1, was active toward all major types of n-linked glycans found in glycosylated proteins. its activity was not affected by core fucosylation or extensive fucosylation, antenna number, or sialylation, releasing several n-glycans from human lactoferrin and immunoglobulins a and g. extensive n-deglycosylation of whole breast milk was also observed after coincubation with this enzyme. mutation of the active site of endobi-1 did not abolish binding to n-glycosylated proteins, and this mutant specifically recognized man(3)glcnac(2)(alpha1-6fuc), the core structure of human n-glycans. endobi-1 is constitutively expressed in b. infantis, and incubation of the bacterium with human or bovine lactoferrin led to the induction of genes associated to import and consumption of human milk oligosaccharides, suggesting linked regulatory mechanisms among these glycans. this work reveals an unprecedented interaction of bifidobacteria with host n-glycans and describes a novel endoglycosidase with broad specificity on diverse n-glycan types, potentially a useful tool for glycoproteomics studies.

AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacterium spp. strains for the treatment of enteric disorders in newborns.
AB  == several studies support the use of probiotics for the treatment of minor gastrointestinal problems in infants. positive effects on newborn colics have been evidenced after administration of lactobacillus strains, whereas no studies  have been reported regarding the use of bifidobacteria for this purpose. this work was therefore aimed at the characterization of bifidobacterium strains capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogens typical of the infant gastrointestinal tract and of coliforms isolated from colic newborns. among the 46 bifidobacterium strains considered, 16 showed high antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens; these strains were further characterized from a taxonomic point of view, for the presence and transferability of antibiotic resistances, for citotoxic effects and adhesion to nontumorigenic gut epithelium  cell lines. moreover, their ability to stimulate gut health by increasing the metabolic activity and the immune response of epithelial cells was also studied.  the examination of all these features allowed to identify three bifidobacterium breve strains and a bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum strain as potential probiotics for the treatments of enteric disorders in newborns such as infantile  colics. a validation clinical trial involving the selected strains is being planned.

TI  == inter-species differences in the growth of bifidobacteria cultured on human milk  oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk (hm) contains as the third most abundant component around 200 different structures of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos). hmos are the first and irreplaceable prebiotics for infants, supporting bifidobacteria as the most important bacterial group in an infant intestine. the aim of our study was to test the growth of bifidobacteria in hm and on hmos. bifidobacteria were isolated from two groups of infants. the first one (eight strains) were isolated from infants who had bifidobacteria in their feces but, after a short period of time (4 to 24 days), bifidobacteria were no longer detected in their feces (disappeared bifidobacteria [db]). the second group of bifidobacteria (eight strains) originated from infants with continual presence of bifidobacteria in their feces (persistent bifidobacteria [pb]). there were significant differences  (p < 0.05) between db and pb groups in the ability of the strains to grow in hm.  pb grew in hm, reaching counts higher than 7 log cfu/ml. in contrast, counts of db decreased from 5 to 4.3 log cfu/ml after cultivation in hm. the final ph after cultivation of bifidobacteria on hmos was 6.2 and 4.9 in dp and pb groups, respectively. in general, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. breve species were able  to utilize hmos, while b. adolescentis and b. longum subsp. longum species did not. the ability to grow in hm and to utilize hmos seem to be important properties of bifidobacteria which are able to colonize infant intestinal tract.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == influence of milk-feeding type and genetic risk of developing coeliac disease on  intestinal microbiota of infants: the proficel study.
AB  == interactions between environmental factors and predisposing genes could be involved in the development of coeliac disease (cd). this study has assessed whether milk-feeding type and hla-genotype influence the intestinal microbiota composition of infants with a family history of cd. the study included 164 healthy newborns, with at least one first-degree relative with cd, classified according to their hla-dq genotype by pcr-ssp dqb1 and dqa1 typing. faecal microbiota was analysed by quantitative pcr at 7 days, and at 1 and 4 months of age. significant interactions between milk-feeding type and hla-dq genotype on bacterial numbers were not detected by applying a linear mixed-model analysis for repeated measures. in the whole population, breast-feeding promoted colonization  of c. leptum group, b. longum and b. breve, while formula-feeding promoted that of bacteroides fragilis group, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, e. coli and b. lactis. moreover, increased numbers of b. fragilis group and staphylococcus spp., and reduced numbers of bifidobacterium spp. and b. longum were detected in infants with increased genetic risk of developing cd. analyses within subgroups of either breast-fed or formula-fed infants indicated that in both cases increased risk of cd was associated with lower numbers of b. longum and/or bifidobacterium spp. in addition, in breast-fed infants the increased genetic risk of developing cd was associated with increased c. leptum group numbers, while in formula-fed infants it was associated with increased staphylococcus and  b. fragilis group numbers. overall, milk-feeding type in conjunction with hla-dq  genotype play a role in establishing infants' gut microbiota; moreover, breast-feeding reduced the genotype-related differences in microbiota composition, which could partly explain the protective role attributed to breast  milk in this disorder.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == cloning and characterization of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase and bifunctional alpha-l-arabinopyranosidase/beta-d-galactopyranosidase from bifidobacterium longum h-1.
AB  == aims: this study focused on the cloning, expression and characterization of recombinant alpha-l-arabinosidases from bifidobacterium longum h-1. methods and results: alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase (afub-h1) and bifunctional alpha-l-arabinopyranosidase/beta-d-galactosidase (apy-h1) from b. longum h-1 were identified by southern blotting, and their recombinant enzymes were overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). recombinant afub-h1 (rafub-h1) was purified by single-step ni(2+) -affinity column chromatography, whereas recombinant apy-h1 (rapy-h1) was purified by serial q-hp and ni(2+) -affinity column chromatography. enzymatic properties and substrate specificities of the two enzymes were assessed, and their kinetic constants were calculated. according to the results,  rafub-h1 hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pnp-alphal-af) and ginsenoside rc, but did not hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (pnp-alphal-ap). on the other hand, rapy-h1 hydrolysed pnp-alphal-ap, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (pnp-betad-ga) and ginsenoside rb2. conclusions: ginsenoside-metabolizing bifidobacterial rafub-h1 and rapy-h1 were successfully cloned, expressed, and characterized. rafub-h1 specifically recognized the alpha-l-arabinofuranoside, whereas rapy-h1 had dual functions, that is, it could hydrolyse both beta-d-galactopyranoside and alpha-l-arabinopyranoside. significance and impact of the study: these findings suggest that the biochemical properties and substrate specificities of these recombinant enzymes differ from those of previously identified alpha-l-arabinosidases from bifidobacterium breve k-110 and clostridium cellulovorans.

TI  == physiology of consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria.
AB  == the bifidogenic effect of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) has long been known, yet the precise mechanism underlying it remains unresolved. recent studies show that some species/subspecies of bifidobacterium are equipped with genetic and enzymatic sets dedicated to the utilization of hmos, and consequently they can grow on hmos; however, the ability to metabolize hmos has not been directly linked to the actual metabolic behavior of the bacteria. in this report, we clarify the fate of each hmo during cultivation of infant gut-associated bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium bifidum jcm1254, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis jcm1222, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum jcm1217, and bifidobacterium breve jcm1192 were selected for this purpose and were grown on hmo media containing a main neutral oligosaccharide fraction. the mono- and oligosaccharides in the spent media were labeled with 2-anthranilic acid, and their concentrations were determined at various incubation times using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. the results reflect the metabolic abilities of the respective bifidobacteria. b. bifidum used secretory glycosidases to degrade hmos, whereas b. longum subsp. infantis assimilated all hmos by incorporating them in their intact forms. b. longum subsp. longum and b.  breve consumed lacto-n-tetraose only. interestingly, b. bifidum left degraded hmo metabolites outside of the cell even when the cells initiate vegetative growth, which indicates that the different species/subspecies can share the produced sugars. the predominance of type 1 chains in hmos and the preferential use of type 1 hmo by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria suggest the coevolution of the bacteria with humans.

TI  == immunostimulatory effect of faecal bifidobacterium species of breast-fed and formula-fed infants in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell/caco-2 co-culture system.
AB  == bifidobacterium spp. typical of the human intestinal microbiota are believed to influence the balance of immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different bifidobacterial species and their mixtures in in vitro experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and caco-2 cells. bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and two combinations  of these bifidobacteria simulating the species composition found in faecal samples from breast-fed (bf) and formula-fed (ff) infants were used. the levels of several cytokines were measured by direct stimulation of pbmc and by stimulation of a caco-2/pbmc co-culture with bifidobacteria. b. catenulatum and b. breve were the strongest enhancers of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) production  by direct stimulation of pbmc. b. longum was the highest inducer of il-10 and the lowest tnf-alpha stimulus. in the caco-2/pbmc system, b. breve was the highest inducer of il-8 production by caco-2 cells, significantly different from b. infantis, b. adolescentis and the ff mixture (p < 0.05). ifn-gamma produced by pbmc stimulated with the bf mixture (containing 22 % b. breve, compared with 7 %  in the ff mixture) was significantly higher compared with b. adolescentis, b. infantis and b. longum. b. adolescentis also inhibited ifn-gamma production compared with the ff mixture and b. longum. the proportion of different bifidobacterium strains seems to be an important determinant of the cytokine balance in the simulated intestinal environment studied. b. breve and the combination of the bifidobacterium species typically found in the microbiota of bf infants have shown the most significant effects.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == oligosaccharides in 4 different milk groups, bifidobacteria, and ruminococcus obeum.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to identify a link between the total amount of breast milk oligosaccharides and faecal microbiota composition of newborns at  the end of the first month of life, with special attention paid to bifidobacteria, and establish the role, if any, of the different oligosaccharides in determining the gut microbiota composition. subjects and methods: milk oligosaccharide groups were identified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. dpcrna from newborns' faecal samples at 30 days of life  was isolated and processed by polymerase chain reaction analyses that allow the identification of 6 species of bifidobacteria (adolescentis, bifidum, breve, catenulatum, longum, infantis) and ruminococcus spp; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also performed. results: no substantial differences  in bifidobacteria species composition within milk groups 1, 2, and 3 were observed; however, infants fed with group 4 milk show a microbiota characterised  by a greater frequency of bifidobacteria adolescentis and the absence of bifidobacteria catenulatum. for the first time, a high percentage of the ruminococcus genus in infants fed with all milk groups was found. conclusions: our data show that milk groups 1, 2, and 3, containing an amount of oligosaccharides ranging within 10 to 15 g/l, share a substantially identical composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants, despite quali-quantitative difference in oligosaccharides content. newborns taking milk with only 5 g/l of oligosaccharides (group 4) harbour a different intestinal microbiota.

TI  == bifidobacterium population analysis in the infant gut by direct mapping of genomic hybridization patterns: potential for monitoring temporal development and effects of dietary regimens.
AB  == a bifidobacterial mixed-species microarray platform was used in a proof-of-principle study to address the composition and development of bifidobacteria in dna extracted from faecal samples. these were collected in a time-course of 2 years since birth and derived from human infants that were breastfed, standard formula-fed or received a prebiotic formula during their weaning period. a set of over 50 samples was analysed, testifying for the throughput of the designed platform for multiple genome hybridizations. the generated data revealed that faecal samples of breastfed infants contained a high abundance of genomic dna homologous to bifidobacterium breve. in contrast, faecal samples from standard formula-fed infants lacked detectable amounts of this b. breve dna but contained genes with high similarity to b. longum. remarkably, infants that received breastmilk and later a prebiotic formula consisting of a standard formula milk containing a mixture of specific galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides, continued to harbour a b. breve-dominant faecal population. one infant that received standard formula in combination with the additional b. lactis bb12 culture, contained significant amounts of faecal dna belonging to bb12 but only during the period of ingestion. the microarray platform showed sufficient sensitivity to analyse the b. breve group at the strain level. overall, the b. breve populations observed in the faecal samples of the studied infants showed a stable composition over time and were unique per infant. in conclusion, our results show the applicability of comparative genome hybridization to study bifidobacterial populations in infant faecal samples without the use of any amplification step.

TI  == the effect of rice fibre fractions on the growth of co-cultures of probiotics.
AB  == the fermentation of rice dietary fibre was measured by the cell yield, ph, optical density specific growth rate and biomass using nine co-cultures of four probiotics at 0, 6, 24 and 48 h incubation. the results from the fermentation of  the soluble, insoluble and total dietary fibre (sdf, idf, and tdf) of two rice varieties were compared. overall there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the fermentation of the six different rice fibre fractions. however, co-cultures showed a preference for glucose as a fermentation substrate rather than the fibre fractions. bifidobacteria species produced a higher cell count than the lactobacillus species after 24 and 48 h of fermentation (p < 0.05). there was evidence of synergistic activity with increased growth observed when lactobacilli and bifidobacterium were grown together. growth was limited by the ph reaching 4.2-4.45. specific growth rates of the co-cultures varied for different culture combinations. combinations of the same species produced less biomass than combinations of mixed species. bifidobacterium breve + bifidobacterium longum + lactobacillus rhamnosus was the most efficient. these findings showed that synergism between microorganisms in co-cultures affected the degree of fermentation of dietary fibre.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of bifidobacterium breve transfer from the mother to her infant during the perinatal period. materials and methods: hundred isolates of b breve and 80 isolates of bifidobacterium longum were collected from paired fecal samples of mothers and their infants. bacterial dna from the samples was comparatively analyzed by random amplification of polymorphic dna. the growth of the bacteria was examined  in vitro. results: the analysis of diversity in b breve population showed that infant-derived isolates had significantly less diversity than mother-derived isolates. the analysis of the similarity between these samples revealed that the  number of shared type isolates tended to be higher in infants than in their mothers. in the isolates of b longum, however, no such difference was found in the diversity between mother- and infant-derived isolates. examination of the growth of b breve strains revealed that the shared type strains have a significantly higher growth than nonshared strains both in the presence of galactooligosaccharides and at a higher redox potential. conclusions: these results suggested that subpopulations of b breve strains in the mothers may be transferred to their infants. such populations may become dominant in the gut of  infants at an early time after birth, during which time the transmission of the bifidobacteria of environmental origin is not yet established. b breve strain possessing a higher growth advantage in these conditions may be advantageous for  colonization in the infant gut.

TI  == examination of faecal bifidobacterium populations in breast- and formula-fed infants during the first 18 months of life.
AB  == bifidobacteria in the infant faecal microbiota have been the focus of much interest, especially during the exclusive milk-feeding period and in relation to  the fortification of infant formulae to better mimic breast milk. however, longitudinal studies examining the diversity and dynamics of the bifidobacterium  population of infants are lacking, particularly in relation to the effects of weaning. using a polyphasic strategy, the bifidobacterium populations of breast-  and formula-fed infants were examined during the first 18 months of life. bifidobacterium-specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated that breast-fed infants harboured greater diversity than formula-fed infants and  the diversity of the infants' bifidobacterium populations increased with weaning. twenty-seven distinctive banding profiles were observed from approximately 1100 infant isolates using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, 14 biotypes of which  were confirmed to be members of the genus bifidobacterium. two profiles (h, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis; and i, bifidobacterium bifidum) were common culturable biotypes, seen in 9/10 infants, while profile e (bifidobacterium breve) was common among breast-fed infants. overall, inter- and  intra-individual differences were observed in the bifidobacterium populations of  infants between 1 and 18 months of age, although weaning was associated with increased diversity of the infant bifidobacterium populations. breast-fed infants generally harboured a more complex bifidobacterium microbiota than formula-fed infants.

TI  == viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt with added oat beta-glucan and corn starch during cold storage.
AB  == probiotics must be consumed at a level of 10(7) cfu/ml for successful colonization of the gut. in yogurts containing beneficial cultures, the survival  of probiotic strains can quickly decline below this critical concentration during cold storage. we hypothesized that beta-glucan would increase the viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt during cold storage. yogurts were produced containing 0.44% beta-glucan (concentrated or freeze-dried) extracted from whole  oat flour and/or 1.33% modified corn starch, and bifidobacteria (b. breve or b. longum) at a concentration of at least 10(9) cfu/ml. all yogurts were stored at 4 degrees c. bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbureckii subsp. bulgaricus, were enumerated from undisturbed aliquots before fermentation, after fermentation, and once a week for 5 wk. s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus maintained a concentration of at least 10(8) cfu/ml in yogurts containing concentrated or freeze-dried beta-glucan regardless  of starch addition, and in the control with no added beta-glucan or starch. similarly, the probiotic, bifidobacterium breve, survived above a therapeutic level in all treatments. the addition of beta-glucan prolonged the survival of bifidobacterium longum at a concentration of at least 10(7) cfu/ml by up to 2 wk  on average beyond the control. further, the inclusion of concentrated beta-glucan in yogurt improved survival of b. longum above 10(7) cfu/ml by 1 wk longer than did freeze-dried beta-glucan. study results suggest that beta-glucan has a protective effect on bifidobacteria in yogurt when stressed by low-temperature storage.

AB  == the objective of this research was to characterize the chemical properties of tomato juice fermented with bifidobacterial species. tomato juice was prepared from fresh tomatoes and heated at 100 degrees c prior to fermentation. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium infantis were  inoculated in tomato juice and kept at 35 to 37 degrees c for up to 6 h. fructooligosaccharide (fos) was added to tomato juice prior to fermentation. the  analyses for brix, total titratable acidity (tta), ph, color, and lycopene content were conducted to characterize tomato juices fermented with bifidobacterial species. heat treatment of tomato juice did not cause any significant changes in brix, ph, and tta. only the redness of tomato juice was significantly increased, as the heating time increased to 30 min. the tomato juices fermented with b. breve and b. longum exhibited significant decreases in ph (3.51 and 3.80, respectively) and significant increases in tta (13.50 and 12.50, respectively) (p < 0.05). b. infantis did not cause any significant change in the chemical properties of tomato juice. the addition of fos further improved  the fermentation of tomato juice by bifidobacterial species. the lycopene contents of tomato juice were significantly increased from 88 to 113 microg/g by  heat treatment at 100 degrees c (p < 0.05), however did not exhibit any significant change after fermentation with bifidobacterial species.

TI  == non-oral bifidobacteria and the aciduric microbiota of the denture plaque biofilm.
AB  == the microbiota of the denture plaque biofilm colonizing the fitting surface of dentures in edentulous subjects with healthy palates (n = 20) and in edentulous subjects with denture stomatitis (n = 20) was studied. the numbers of bacteria colonizing the dentures of healthy subjects was significantly less than the numbers colonizing the dentures of stomatitis subjects. the proportions and frequency of isolation of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and yeasts were significantly (p < 0.05) greater in the subjects with denture stomatitis. the proportions of these organisms in the denture plaque biofilm of the subjects with denture stomatitis were similar to those found in carious lesions, indicating that the site is a low ph environment. the predominant bifidobacterial species in the mouths of dentate subjects is bifidobacterium dentium but in the edentulous subjects wearing dentures b. dentium was isolated from only one of the 20 subjects with denture stomatitis and from none of the 20  subjects with healthy palates. instead, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium scardovii and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum were isolated. only a single non-oral bifidobacterial species was isolated from each individual and repetitive extragenic palindromic- and box-polymerase chain reaction typing methods indicated that the same genotypes were shared between subjects. using deferred antagonism spot plate assays, interspecies inhibition was demonstrated between oral isolates of b. dentium, b. breve, b. scardovii and b. longum subsp. longum.  here we have shown that bifidobacteria and caries-associated microbiota are present in denture plaque at levels similar to those of carious lesions and b. dentium cannot be maintained in an edentulous mouth.

TI  == distinct bifidobacterium strains drive different immune responses in vitro.
AB  == in this work we evaluated the specific immune activation properties of different  bifidobacterium strains, some of the most relevant intestinal microorganisms. to  this end, we examined the in vitro effect of 12 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 4 different species, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, on the maturation pattern of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs), as well as in their ability to induce cytokine secretion. in addition, we determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation and cytokine expression after exposure to bacterial strains. all bifidobacteria tested were able to induce full dc maturation but showed differences in the levels of cytokine production, especially il-12, il-10, tnfalpha and il-1beta, suggesting that specific cytokine ratios could be used to predict the type of th response that they may promote. in fact, analysis of cytokine production by pbmc showed that most of the tested b. animalis and b. longum strains induced the secretion of large amounts of ifngamma and tnfalpha, in agreement with the th1 profile suggested by dc cytokine production. remarkably, three of four b. bifidum strains induced poor secretion of these cytokines and significant amounts of il-17, the main product of th17 cells, in accordance with the high il-1beta/il-12 ratio observed after dc stimulation. in conclusion, this work shows species and strain-specific immune effects of bifidobacteria and describes a valuable method for screening possible  probiotic strains with different immunomodulatory properties. notably, some b. bifidum strains seem to promote th17 polarization, which could be useful for future probiotic applications.

TI  == bacterial strain-specific induction of foxp3+ t regulatory cells is protective in murine allergy models.
AB  == background: the incidence of atopic disease has increased dramatically during recent decades and the potential immunoregulatory influence of the microbiota in  these individuals is under investigation. objective: the aim of our study was to  identify a bacterial strain that is protective in murine allergy models and to determine if microbial induction of t regulatory cells was associated with protection from allergic inflammation. methods: three microbes (bifidobacterium breve ah1205, b. longum ah1206 and lactobacillus salivarius ah102) of human origin were fed to newborn, adult and germ-free animals. induction of foxp3(+) t  regulatory cells was assessed by flow cytometry. gene array analysis was performed on peyer's patches. strains were also examined for their protective effects in the ovalbumin (ova) respiratory allergy model and the ova-cholera toxin dietary allergy model. results: bifidobacterium longum ah1206 consumption resulted in increased numbers of foxp3(+) t regulatory cells in infant, adult and germ-free animals. b. breve ah1205 induced foxp3(+) t regulatory cell expansion only in infant mice while l. salivarius ah102 did not alter t regulatory cell numbers in any animal model tested. b. longum ah1206 reduced the peyer's patch gene expression associated with antigen presentation, tlr signalling and cytokine production while increasing the expression of genes associated with retinoic acid metabolism. b. longum ah1206 protected against airway inflammation in ova-sensitized animals and b. longum ah1206 blocked the induction of ige to orally administered ova. neither b. breve ah1205 nor l. salivarius ah102 had a protective effect in either model. conclusion: bacterial strain-specific induction of foxp3(+) t regulatory cells in vivo is associated with protection from respiratory and oral allergy.

TI  == species delineation and clonal diversity in four bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.
AB  == the genus bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the gut microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. we sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 bifidobacterium strains of  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that b. longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within b. longum subsp. longum. clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate leaky species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in b. bifidum, b. breve and b. longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies. frequent homologous recombination accelerates clonal diversification and may facilitate the transfer of biological  properties among bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == understanding the acid tolerance response of bifidobacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of ph on the viability and the acid tolerance response (atr) of bifidobacteria. methods and results: the impact of low ph on the viability of five species of bifidobacteria was examined under conditions of  strict anaerobiosis. although differences in the ability to resist the lethal effects of low ph were apparent among the species, cell viability could be improved by the provision of fermentable substrate during an acidic ph stress or  through the use of stationary phase cells. while a stationary phase atr was found to occur in two species of bifidobacteria, there was no adaptive response in exponential phase cells. proteomic analysis of exponential phase bifidobacterium  longum subjected to a mild acid pre-exposure (ph 4.5, 2 h) prior to an acid challenge revealed a substantial loss in the total number of cellular proteins. in contrast, proteomic analysis of stationary phase cells revealed an increased abundance of proteins associated with the general stress response as well as the  beta-subunit of the f(0)f(1)-atpase, known to be important in bifidobacteria acid tolerance. conclusion: neither bif. longum or bifidobacterium breve possesses an  inducible exponential phase atr. significance and impact of the study: these findings provide further insights into the impact of ph on the viability of bifidobacteria and may partially explain the loss in viability associated with their storage in acid foods.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of arabinoxylan-derived carbohydrates by bifidobacteria and mixed fecal microbiota.
AB  == bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703, bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and human fecal microbiota were cultivated in  vitro with d-xylose, l-arabinose, xylo-oligosaccharides (xos), and arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (axos) as carbon sources. the ph, formation of volatile fatty acids, and carbohydrate utilization profiles were followed. in the pure bifidobacteria cultures optical density and in the fecal slurries pressure and h(2) were also detected. a differing substrate preference was observed among  the various bifidobacteria strains. b. adolescentis grew on xos, slowly on d-xylose, but not on l-arabinose. in contrast, b. longum preferred l-arabinose and did not grow on pure d-xylose or xos. both strains were able to utilize axos  but with differing strategies, since after the cleavage of l-arabinose b. adolescentis consumed the xos formed, whereas b. longum fermented the l-arabinose released. b. breve grew poorly on all of the substrates provided. a bifidobacterial mixture and the fecal microbiota were able to utilize pure singly substituted axos almost completely, but pure axos with a doubly substituted xylose residue was fermented only by the fecal microbiota. thus, axos appear to be potential candidates for slowly fermenting prebiotics, but their prebiotic effects may be dependent on the type of arabinose substitution and the presence of other carbohydrates.

TI  == site and clinical significance of alloscardovia omnicolens and bifidobacterium species isolated in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == most of the members of the genus bifidobacterium, including the related organism  alloscardovia omnicolens, are inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract and oral  cavity of humans and animals and have been considered nonpathogenic for humans. however, the actual site of isolation and the clinical significance of a. omnicolens and of bifidobacterium species are unclear. this may be due in part to the difficulties in distinguishing these organisms from other genera such as actinomyces. to determine the potential disease-causing role of these organisms,  we analyzed the clinical significance of 15 a. omnicolens and bifidobacterium isolates identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing from a clinical laboratory. all of the organisms in this study were isolated from sterile sites or in significant numbers by standard clinical microbiological culture methods. our 15 clinical strains fit into only four species: a. omnicolens (five isolates), bifidobacterium scardovii (four isolates), b. longum (two isolates), and b. breve (four isolates). all five a. omnicolens isolates, one of the b. breve isolates, and three of the four b. scardovii isolates were cultured from urine at 10(5) cfu/ml. one b. scardovii isolate was from a patient with a genitourinary tract wound infection, two b. longum isolates were from abdominal wounds, and three b.  breve isolates were from blood cultures. this study enlarges the spectrum of diseases and clinical sources associated with a. omnicolens and bifidobacterium species and addresses identification problems.

TI  == safety evaluation of probiotic bifidobacteria by analysis of mucin degradation activity and translocation ability.
AB  == although probiotic-containing nutrient formulas for infants and toddlers have become very popular, some adverse effects related to translocation of probiotic strains have been reported. we assessed the safety of probiotic bifidobacteria that have been used in clinical investigations and proven to have beneficial effects, by analyzing mucin degradation activity and translocation ability. mucin degradation activities of three probiotic bifidobacteria strains; bifidobacterium longum bb536, bifidobacterium breve m-16v and bifidobacterium infantis m-63, were evaluated by three in vitro tests comprising growth in liquid medium, sds-page analysis of degraded mucin residues, and degradation assay in petri dish. all test strains and control type strains failed to grow in the liquid medium containing mucin as the only carbon source, although good growth was obtained from fecal sample. in the sds-page analyses of mucin residues and observation of  mucinolytic zone in agar plate, the three test strains also showed no mucin degradation activity as the type strains, although fecal sample yielded positive  results. in another study, a high dose of b. longum bb536 was administered orally to conventional mice to examine the translocation ability. no translocation into  blood, liver, spleen, kidney and mesenteric lymph nodes was observed and no disturbance of epithelial cells and mucosal layer in the ileum, cecum and colon was detected, indicating that the test strain had no translocation ability and induced no damage to intestinal surface. these results resolve the concern about  bacterial translocation when using bifidobacteria strains as probiotics, which have been tested in various clinical trials, supporting the continuous use of these probiotic strains without anxiety.

TI  == bifidobacterial enolase, a cell surface receptor for human plasminogen involved in the interaction with the host.
AB  == the interaction with the host plasminogen/plasmin system represents a novel component in the molecular cross-talk between bifidobacteria and human host. here, we demonstrated that the plasminogen-binding bifidobacterial species b. longum, b. bifidum, b. breve and b. lactis share the key glycolytic enzyme enolase as a surface receptor for human plasminogen. enolase was visualized on the cell surface of the model strain b. lactis bi07. the his-tagged recombinant protein showed a high affinity for human plasminogen, with an equilibrium dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. by site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrated that the interaction between the b. lactis bi07 enolase and human plasminogen involves an internal plasminogen-binding site homologous to that of pneumococcal enolase. according to our data, the positively charged residues lys-251 and lys-255, as well as the negatively charged glu-252, of the b. lactis  bi07 enolase are crucial for plasminogen binding. acting as a human plasminogen receptor, the bifidobacterial surface enolase is suggested to play an important role in the interaction process with the host.

TI  == coculture of bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve alters their protein expression profiles and enzymatic activities.
AB  == some strains of the genus bifidobacterium are probiotic bacteria commonly added to functional dairy products. the influence of coculturing bifidobacterium longum ncimb8809 and bifidobacterium breve ncimb8807 on their physiology was studied. 2de separation of protein extracts, coupled to ms protein analysis allowed the identification of 16 proteins whose expression drastically changed when cells were grown in compartmentalized coculture, compared to monoculture. these included ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, gene regulation, cell envelope biogenesis and transport processes. significant changes in some glycoside-hydrolysing activities (beta-d-xylopyranosidase, alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase and beta-d-glucopyranosidase) were also detected. furthermore, qrt-pcr experiments using as targets the b. breve genes clgr (transcriptional regulator) clpp1, clpp2 and clpc (chaperone- and protease-encoding genes positively regulated by clgr) supported the proteomic results, the four genes displaying a higher expression level in coculture. this study provides new insights to understand the communication among bifidobacterium species.

TI  == a versatile and scalable strategy for glycoprofiling bifidobacterial consumption  of human milk oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains approximately 200 complex oligosaccharides believed to stimulate the growth and establishment of a protective microbiota in the infant gut. the lack of scalable analytical techniques has hindered the measurement of bacterial metabolism of these and other complex prebiotic oligosaccharides. an in vitro, multi-strain, assay capable of measuring kinetics of bacterial growth and  detailed oligosaccharide consumption analysis by fticr-ms was developed and tested simultaneously on 12 bifidobacterial strains. for quantitative consumption, deuterated and reduced human milk oligosaccharide (hmo) standards were used. a custom software suite developed in house called glycolyzer was used  to process the large amounts of oligosaccharide mass spectra automatically with (13)c corrections based on de-isotoping protocols. high growth on hmos was characteristic of bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis strains, which consumed  nearly all available substrates, while other bifidobacterial strains tested, b. longum bv. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve and b. bifidum, showed low or only moderate growth ability. total oligosaccharide consumption ranged from a high of  87% for b. infantis jcm 7009 to only 12% for b. adolescentis atcc 15703. a detailed analysis of consumption glycoprofiles indicated strain-specific capabilities towards differential metabolism of milk oligosaccharides. this method overcomes previous limitations in the quantitative, multi-strain analysis  of bacterial metabolism of hmos and represents a novel approach towards understanding bacterial consumption of complex prebiotic oligosaccharides.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == anti-inflammatory effects of the genus bifidobacterium on macrophages by modification of phospho-i kappab and socs gene expression.
AB  == although beneficial roles of probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases have been reported, their direct action on immune cells has not been elucidated. in this study, we investigated how three species of bifidobacterium and enterococcus faecalis differentially modulate production of cytokines from lipopolysaccharide  (lps)-stimulated macrophages in vitro using raw264.7 cells. the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased after exposure to lps, e. faecalis alone and lps combined with e. faecalis. in contrast, il-10 mrna levels  were significantly decreased after exposure to e. faecalis compared with exposure to bifidobacterium species. when cells were exposed to bifidobacterium species combined with lps, mrna levels of il12p40 were decreased by co-culture with b. breve and b. longum, il-1 beta mrna levels were decreased by b. breve and b. adorescentis and tnf-alpha mrna levels were decreased by b. adolescentis compared with lps alone. the three species of bifidobacterium significantly inhibited phosphorylation of i kappab-alpha induced by lps. the mrna levels of socs1 and socs3 were increased by exposure to lps alone; however, the mrna levels of socs1  or socs3 were increased more by exposure to bifidobacterium species combined with lps. conversely, e. faecalis combined with lps induced significantly lower levels of socs mrna than those induced by bifidobacterium species combined with lps. these results indicated that certain species of genus bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced from lps-stimulated raw264.7 cells, which is possibly related to inhibition of i kappab-alpha phosphorylation and stimulation of socs signalling.

TI  == bile-inducible efflux transporter from bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, conferring bile resistance.
AB  == bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human gut. some strains of this genus are considered health promoting or probiotic, being included in numerous food products. in order to exert their health benefits, these bacteria must overcome biological barriers, including bile salts, to colonize and survive in specific parts of the intestinal tract. the role of multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters in bile resistance of probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile on probiotic gene expression are not fully understood. in the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of bile on the expression levels of predicted mdr genes from three different bifidobacterial strains, belonging to bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis, was tested. in this way, two putative mdr genes whose expression was induced by bile, bl0920 from b. longum and its homolog, bbr0838, from b. breve, were identified. the expression of the bl0920 gene in escherichia  coli was shown to confer resistance to bile, likely to be mediated by active efflux from the cells. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identified bifidobacterial bile efflux pump whose expression is induced by bile.

AB  == four bifidobacteria, each representing a cluster of strains with specific inulin-type-fructan degradation capacities, were grown in coculture fermentations with bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262, a strain able to metabolize both oligofructose and inulin. in a medium for colon bacteria with inulin as the sole  added energy source, the ability of the bifidobacteria to compete for this substrate reflected phenotypical variation. bifidobacterium breve yakult, a strain that was not able to degrade oligofructose or inulin, was outcompeted by b. thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262. bifidobacterium adolescentis lmg 10734, a strain that could degrade oligofructose (displaying a preferential breakdown mechanism)  but that did not grow on inulin, managed to become competitive when oligofructose and short fractions of inulin started to accumulate in the fermentation medium. bifidobacterium angulatum lmg 11039(t), a strain that was previously shown to degrade all oligofructose fractions simultaneously and to be able to partially break down inulin, was competitive from the beginning of the fermentation, consuming short fractions of inulin from the moment they appeared. bifidobacterium longum lmg 11047, representing a cluster of bifidobacteria that shared both high fructose consumption and oligofructose degradation rates and were able to perform partial breakdown of inulin, was the dominating strain in a  coculture with b. thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262. these observations indicate that distinct subgroups within the large-intestinal bifidobacterium population will be stimulated by different groups of prebiotic inulin-type fructans, a variation that could be reflected in differences concerning their health-promoting effects.

AB  == the bifidobacterium spp. present in 10 infant fecal samples (4 from infants with  eczema and 6 from healthy infants) were quantified with both hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry. the relative abundances of bifidobacterium longum and b. catenulatum with respect to the total bifidobacteria had a poor correlation (rho, <0.600; p value, >0.208), presumably due to differences in primer specificity and the level of hybridization stringency of both methods. in  contrast, the relative abundances of organisms of the genus bifidobacterium against the total amplified 16s rrna genes and those of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. breve against the genus bifidobacterium exhibited a good statistical correlation (rho, >0.783; p value, <0.066). this good comparability supports hope as a method to achieve high-throughput quantitative determination of bacterial targets in a time- and cost-effective manner.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == examination of bovine lactoferrin binding to bifidobacteria.
AB  == in the present study, lactoferrin binding to bifidobacteria and detection of lactoferrin-binding protein in membrane fractions of several bifidobacteria have  been demonstrated. this is the first report showing the binding of bovine lactoferrin to four bifidobacterium spp. (b. infantis, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum) incubated with biotinylated lactoferrin and fluorescein conjugated-avidin and observed under an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. fluorescence staining showed lactoferrin binding at the pole of the bacterial cells. a lactoferrin-binding protein with a molecular weight of approximately 67 kda was also detected in the membrane fraction of bifidobacterium spp. by far western blotting technique using biotinylated lactoferrin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. based on the results of this and previously reported studies, we suggest that binding of lactoferrin to bifidobacterium longum is strain-dependent.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

TI  == characterization of plasmids from human infant bifidobacterium strains: sequence  analysis and construction of e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors.
AB  == a survey of infant fecal bifidobacterium isolates for plasmid dna revealed that a significant portion of the strains, 17.6%, carry small plasmids. the majority of  plasmid-harboring strains belonged to the bifidobacterium longum/infantis group.  most of the plasmids could be assigned into two groups based on their sizes and the restriction profiles. three plasmids, pb44 (3.6 kb) from b. longum, pb80 (4.9 kb) from bifidobacterium bifidum, and pb21a (5.2kb) from bifidobacterium breve were sequenced. while the former two plasmids were found to be highly similar to  previously characterized rolling-circle replicating pkj36 and pkj56, respectively, the third plasmid, pb21a, does not share significant nucleotide homology with known plasmids. however, it might be placed into the pcibb1-like group of bifidobacterial rolling-plasmids based on the homology of its rep protein and the overall molecular organization. two sets of escherichia coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors constructed based on pb44 and pb80 replicons were capable of transforming b. bifidum and b. breve strains with efficiency up to 3x10(4)cfu/microg dna. additionally, an attempt was made to employ a broad host range conjugation element, rp4, in developing of e. coli-bifidobacterium gene transfer system.

TI  == assessment on the fermentability of xylooligosaccharides from rice husks by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == liquors from rice husk autohydrolysis, containing xylooligosaccharides (xos), other saccharides, and nonsaccharide compounds, were refined by membrane processing to increase the proportion of substituted xos in refined liquors. xos  were assayed for composition and degree of polymerization (dp) distribution and hydrolyzed with commercial enzymes for obtaining xos with dp in the range of 2-6. nanofiltered, hydrolyzed liquors were subjected to ion exchange processing to yield a final product containing monosaccharides, xos (accounting for 55.6% of the nonvolatile solutes), and other nonvolatile compounds. the solution obtained  after enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial xylanases (in which 82.8% of xos were  in the dp range of 2-6) was examined as a medium for promoting the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis cect 5781, b. longum cect 4503, b. infantis cect 4551, and b. breve cect 4839. the growth rate of b. adolescentis (0.58 h(-1)) was higher than the ones determined for b. longum, b. infantis, and b. breve (0.37, 0.30, and 0.40 h(-1), respectively). the percentage of total xos consumption by b. adolescentis was 77% after 24 h, the highest percentage of utilization corresponding to xylotriose (90%), followed by xylobiose (84%), xylotetraose (83%), and xylopentaose (71%).

TI  == top-down systems biology integration of conditional prebiotic modulated transgenomic interactions in a humanized microbiome mouse model.
AB  == gut microbiome-host metabolic interactions affect human health and can be modified by probiotic and prebiotic supplementation. here, we have assessed the effects of consumption of a combination of probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei or l. rhamnosus) and two galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics on the symbiotic microbiome-mammalian supersystem using integrative metabolic profiling and modeling of multiple compartments in germ-free mice inoculated with a model of human baby microbiota. we have shown specific impacts of two prebiotics on the microbial populations of hbm mice when co-administered with two probiotics. we observed an increase in the populations of bifidobacterium longum and b. breve, and a reduction in clostridium perfringens, which were more marked when combining prebiotics with l. rhamnosus. in turn, these microbial effects were associated with modulation of a range of host metabolic pathways observed via changes in lipid profiles, gluconeogenesis, and amino-acid and methylamine metabolism associated to fermentation of carbohydrates by different bacterial strains. these results provide evidence for the potential use of prebiotics for beneficially modifying the gut microbial balance as well as host energy and lipid homeostasis.

TI  == production of human basic fibroblast growth factor (fgf-2) in bifidobacterium breve using a series of novel expression/secretion vectors.
AB  == four e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors were constructed using bifidobacterium plasmids, pb44 and pb80. the vectors carry two bifidobacterial promoters, a signal peptide-encoding sequence, sec2, of bifidobacterium breve, and a transcriptional terminator from hup gene of bifidobacterium longum. functionality of the constructs were tested using human fgf-2 gene. the expression of fgf-2 was detected by western blotting in b. breve transformed with three of the vectors. the highest amount of fgf-2 was produced upon transformation with pesh86, which is a pb80-based plasmid carrying fgf-2 under control of a hup promoter (phup). similarly, the level of fgf-2 mrna transcribed  from pesh86 was approximately threefold higher, 882 +/- 70 au (arbitrary units),  when compared to those transcribed from pb44-based pesh46 (phup) (289 +/- 65 au)  and pesh47 (pgap) (282 +/- 37 au). these results suggest the vectors have the potential for production of exported fusion proteins in bifidobacteria and the expression levels can be regulated through the employment of different bifidobacterial promoters and/or replicons.

TI  == bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  == faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic bifidobacterium longum strains: 2c  and 46), placebo and commercial control (bifidobacterium lactis bb-12). the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific pcr. serum levels of the cytokines il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. the most frequently detected species were b. longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum. depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. negative correlations were observed between the levels of bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the regulatory cytokine il-10. the presence of faecal b. longum and bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum il-10. the anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum tgf-beta1 levels. this indicates that modulation of the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a  means of influencing inflammatory responses.

TI  == fecal microflora of greek healthy neonates.
AB  == this study aimed to explore, in our geographical region, the development of intestinal microflora and the colonization patterns of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria during the first three months of life and to investigate the effect of the mode of delivery. fecal specimens from 82 healthy, full-term infants were collected prospectively 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery and subcultured on nonselective and selective media. identification of isolates was performed by microbiological and molecular methods. for the delivery effect, two  groups of vaginally or caesarean-delivered exclusively breast-fed infants were studied. despite the early high total counts of aerobes and anaerobes, colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was overall limited until 3 months of age. furthermore, caesarean-delivered infants were less often colonized with lactobacilli at day 4 (4% vs. 59%, p = 0.000) and with bifidobacteria at day 4 (0% vs. 23%, p = 0.015) and 30 (0% vs. 35%, p = 0.042) compared to vaginally delivered ones. no bacterial populations differences were detected to compare colonized infants. identification results indicated the predominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus paracasei species in neonatal gut microflora up to the first month of life and diversity of lactobacillus species in vaginally delivered, colonized newborns, at fourth day.  furthermore, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve were the most frequently detected bifidobacterium species in vaginally delivered, breast-fed infants. in conclusion our study revealed a restricted colonization pattern of lactic acid bacteria in greek infants and a delay in the development of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium spp. microbiota after caesarean section. further analysis of potential consequences of these findings is required.

TI  == exogenous cytosine deaminase gene expression in bifidobacterium breve i-53-8w for tumor-targeting enzyme/prodrug therapy.
AB  == bifidobacteria are nonpathogenic, anaerobic domestic bacteria with health-promoting properties for the host. in our previous study, bifidobacterium  longum (b. longum) were found to be localized selectively and to proliferate within solid tumors after systemic application. additionally, b. longum transformed by shuttle-plasmid including the cytosine deaminase (cd) gene expressed active cd, converted the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-fc) to 5-fluorouracil (5-fu). we also demonstrated antitumor efficacy with a transformant of b. longum in rats. in this study, we found that bifidobacterium breve (b. breve), the smallest species of human-derived bifidobacterium, expressed the exogenous transgene (cd), that cd enzymatic activity in the transformant of b. breve was much higher, and that the segregational stability of the plasmid was greater than that of b. longum. thus, numerous transformants of b. breve were detected solely in the tumors after systemic administration. we consider the transformant of b. breve to be more beneficial in our enzyme/prodrug therapy.

TI  == gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  == bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. for a better understanding of the effect of bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at  determining the impact of bifidobacterium on the t-helper 1 (t(h)1)/t(h)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. germfree mice were inoculated with bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine bifidobacterium strains  isolated from infants' fecal flora. five days after inoculation, mice were killed. transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), interleukin-4 (il-4), il-10, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, il-4, and il-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin a were quantified. two bifidobacterium species had no effect (b. adolescentis) or little effect (b. breve) on the immune system. bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  dentium, and one b. longum strain induced t(h)1 and t(h)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. one b. longum strain induced a t(h)2 orientation  with high levels of il-4 and il-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of tgf-beta gene expression in the ileum. the other two strains induced t(h)1 orientations with high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha splenocyte secretions. bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.

TI  == bifidobacteria in feces and environmental waters.
AB  == bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. the objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. genus- and species-specific 16s rrna gene pcr assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal dna extracts from 32 different animals. twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. the species-specific assays showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, and b. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described bifidobacterium spp. the b. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. in contrast, two clades containing b. thermophilum and b. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water dna extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters.  overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.

TI  == selection of phytate-degrading human bifidobacteria and application in whole wheat dough fermentation.
AB  == lately, whole wheat products are highly recommended from their healthy properties. however, the presence of phytic acid (insp(6)) could partly limit their benefits because it decreases the mineral bioavailability due to its chelating properties. the objective of this work was to select strains with high  phytate-degrading activity from human feces, and evaluate their suitability for the bread making process. twenty-three different bifidobacterial strains (13 from infants and 10 from adults) were isolated, belonging to the species bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the phosphatase and phytase activities of these strains were evaluated as well as their ability to degrade insp(6) during growth. then, the fermentative ability of the strain showing the highest phytate-degrading activity (b. longum. bif307) was determined in whole wheat breadmaking. the use of the selected bifidobacterial strain as starter during whole wheat fermentation resulted in bread with similar  technological quality than the control (in absence of bifidobacteria) and crumb with lower levels of inositol phosphates. therefore, the used of the selected bifidobacterium strain in whole wheat breadmaking process could provide potential nutritional benefits by decreasing the antinutrient content of the product.

TI  == in vitro fermentability of human milk oligosaccharides by several strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the catabolism and fermentation of human  milk oligosaccharides (hmo) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. oligosaccharides were isolated from a pooled sample of human milk using solid-phase extraction, and then added to a growth medium as the sole source of fermentable carbohydrate. of five strains of bifidobacteria tested (bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum biovar longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium adolescentis), b. longum bv. infantis grew better, achieving triple the cell density then the other strains. b. bifidum did not reach a high cell density, yet generated free sialic acid, fucose and n-acetylglucosamine in the media, suggesting some capacity for hmo degradation. thin layer chromatography profiles of spent fermentation broth suggests substantial degradation of oligosaccharides by b. longum bv. infantis, moderate degradation by b. bifidum and little degradation by other strains. while all strains were able to individually ferment two monosaccharide constituents of hmo, glucose and galactose, only b. longum bv. infantis and b. breve were able to ferment glucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. these results suggest that as a potential prebiotic, hmo may selectively promote  the growth of certain bifidobacteria strains, and their catabolism may result in  free monosaccharides in the colonic lumen.

TI  == oral administration of bifidobacterium longum prevents gut-derived pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis in mice.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on gut-derived sepsis caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in immunocompromised mice. methods and results: after oral inoculation of p. aeruginosa, mice were treated with cyclophosphamide to induce leucopenia and translocation of the intestinal p. aeruginosa into blood, thereby producing gut-derived sepsis. in this model, administration of 1 x 10(9) cfu of bifidobacterium longum strain bb536 for 10 days significantly (p < 0.01) increased the survival rate compared with groups of mice administered either with bifidobacterium breve strain atcc 15700 or excipients contained in the probiotic bacterial powder. administration of b. longum significantly decreased viable counts of p. aeruginosa in the liver and blood compared with other groups. culture of intestinal contents revealed a significantly lower viable count of p. aeruginosa in the jejunum of b. longum-treated mice compared with other groups of mice. furthermore, in vitro data demonstrated that b. longum possessed apparently higher adherent activity to caco-2 cell monolayers and significantly suppressed the adherence of p. aeruginosa to the monolayers of cells compared with other groups. conclusion: oral administration of b. longum protects mice against gut-derived sepsis caused  by p. aeruginosa, and the effect may be due to interference of p. aeruginosa adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. significance and impact of this study:  this study demonstrated that oral administration of b. longum bb536 is effective  to protect against opportunistic infection with drug-resistant bacteria such as p. aeruginosa. the results suggest that probiotics may play an important role even in the immunocompromised patients.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == establishment and follow-up of bifidobacterial species in the gut of healthy bottle-fed infants of 1-4 months age.
AB  == twenty-one healthy bottle-fed infants were screened monthly (1-4 months) for bifidobacteria in their stools. bifidobacteria were detected by culture and isolates specified by pcr. alternatively, direct pcr in undiluted fecal suspensions was carried out for detection of bifidobacteria under the cultural detection level. all infants harbored cultivable bifidobacteria throughout the study period. beerens medium was shown to permit a better recovery of bifidobacteria than mrs and horse blood columbia agar. direct pcr detection proved valuable in detecting species for which no cultural isolate could be recovered since the species were under the cultural detection level. b. bifidum,  b. longum-infantis and b. breve were confirmed as dominant and stable species in  infant stools while b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum group exhibited unstable colonization profiles. a trend towards b. breve decrease began at month 3 while carriage of the b. catenulatum group and b. adolescentis was rising. this observation warrants further analysis to assess a possible switch occurring at month 3 in bottle-fed infants, between so-called infant and adult bifidobacterial species.

TI  == a longitudinal study of infant faecal microbiota during weaning.
AB  == for infants, the introduction of food other than breast milk is a high risk period due to diarrheal diseases, and may be corroborated with a shift in the faecal microbiota. this longitudinal study was the first undertaken to understand the effect of the supplementation on the infant's faecal microbiota and particularly the bifidobacteria. eleven infants were enrolled. their faecal microbiota were analysed using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis  (ttge) with bacterial and bifidobacterial primers. in parallel, bifidobacterial counts were followed using competitive pcr. three periods were distinguished: exclusive breastfeeding (bf period), weaning (i.e. formula-milk addition, w period) and postweaning (i.e. breastfeeding cessation, pw period). the bifidobacterial counts were not modified, reaching 10.5 (log10 cells g(-1) wet weight). in the ttge profiles, the main identified bands corresponded to escherichia coli, ruminococcus sp. and bifidobacterium sp., more precisely bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium breve. for both ttge profiles, the analysis of the distance suggested a maturation of the faecal microbiota but no correlation could be established with the diet. despite  a high interindividual variability, composition of the faecal microbiota appeared more homogenous after weaning and this point may be correlated with the cessation of breastfeeding.

TI  == identification and characterization of a fructose phosphotransferase system in bifidobacterium breve ucc2003.
AB  == in silico analysis of the bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 genome allowed identification of four genetic loci, each of which specifies a putative enzyme ii (eii) protein of a phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. the eii encoded by frua, a clear homologue of the unique eiibca enzyme encoded by the bifidobacterium longum ncc2705 genome, was studied in more detail. the frua gene  is part of an operon which contains frut, which is predicted to encode a homologue of the bacillus subtilis antiterminator lict. transcriptional analysis  showed that the fru operon is induced by fructose. the genetic structure, complementation studies, and the observed transcription pattern of the fru operon suggest that the eii encoded in b. breve is involved in fructose transport and that its expression is controlled by an antiterminator mechanism. biochemical studies unequivocally demonstrated that frua phosphorylates fructose at the c-6 position.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == [a molecular-and-genetic analysis of species and strain diversity of bifidobacteria in early childhood].
AB  == the species and strain composition of bifidobacteria in 29 children both sexes, aged 8 to 16 months, was studied. species-specific primers and pcr were used to determine to which species the predominant strains of bifidobacteria, isolated from feces by cultural methods, belonged. bifidobacteria were found in 28 (96.5%) children; their number was 10.2 +/- 0.7 ecu per a gram of the material. b. longum and b. bifidum were frequent (71.4 and 53.5%, respectively). the level of quantitative detection used in the study also allowed revealing of b. catenulatum (17.9%) and b. breve (14.4%). a high titer of b. dentium was found in one case (3.6%). b. adolescentis and b. angulatum were not found in any patient. the average number of species found in one child was 1.7 +/- 0.7. rapd-pcr and investigation of plasmid profile were used to determine possible belonging of the isolates to different strains. the average number of strains per one sample was 2.3 +/- 1.2. nine unique plasmid bifidobacterial strains were isolated from 7 children. in 3 children the intestinal tract was found to be colonized by both plasmid and non-plasmid-carrying strains of one bifidobacterial species.

TI  == determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

TI  == effect of maternal consumption of lactobacillus gg on transfer and establishment  of fecal bifidobacterial microbiota in neonates.
AB  == background: establishment of the gut microbiota at birth provides a substantial source of microbial stimuli for the maturation of the immune system. deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. objective: this study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth  and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or placebo. methods: species-specific pcr was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of  mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. results: bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and b. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. at 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received l. rhamnosus gg showed a significantly higher occurrence of b. breve and lower of b. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. in addition, l. rhamnosus gg consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. conclusions: these results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of l. rhamnosus gg by the mothers.

TI  == prophage-like elements in bifidobacteria: insights from genomics, transcription,  integration, distribution, and phylogenetic analysis.
AB  == so far, there is only fragmentary and unconfirmed information on bacteriophages infecting the genus bifidobacterium. in this report we analyzed three prophage-like elements that are present in the genomes of bifidobacterium breve ucc 2003, bifidobacterium longum ncc 2705, and bifidobacterium longum djo10a, designated bbr-1, bl-1, and blj-1, respectively. these prophagelike elements exhibit homology with genes of double-stranded dna bacteriophages spanning a broad phylogenetic range of host bacteria and are surprisingly closely related to bacteriophages infecting low-g+c bacteria. all three prophage-like elements are integrated in a trna(met) gene, which appears to be reconstructed following phage integration. analysis of the distribution of this integration site in many bifidobacterial species revealed that the attb sites are well conserved. the blj-1 prophage is 36.9 kb long and was induced when a b. longum djo10a culture was exposed to mitomycin c or hydrogen peroxide. the bbr-1 prophage-like element  appears to consist of a noninducible 28.5-kb chimeric dna fragment composed of a  composite mobile element inserted into prophage-like sequences, which do not appear to be widely distributed among b. breve strains. northern blot analysis of the bbr-1 prophage-like element showed that large parts of its genome are transcriptionally silent. interestingly, a gene predicted to encode an extracellular beta-glucosidase carried within the bbr-1 prophage-like element was shown to be transcribed.

TI  == rapid identification of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s rrna.
AB  == this study aimed at developing a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  primer set for identification of the potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species b. adolescentis, b. animalis subsp. animalis (b. animalis), b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum biovar infantis (b. infantis), b. animalis subsp. lactis b. lactis, b. longum biovar longum (b. longum) and b. pseudolongum. the primer set comprised specific and conserved primers and was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna genes and the rrna intergenic spacer region (isr) of each species. it could detect and identify type strains and isolates from pharmaceuticals or dairy products corresponding to the eight bifidobacterium species with high specificity. it was also useful for screening of the related strains from natural sources such as the gastro-intestinal tract and feces. we suggest that the assay system from this study is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of bifidobacterium species for which probiotic  strains are known.

TI  == culture-dependent and culture-independent qualitative analysis of probiotic products claimed to contain bifidobacteria.
AB  == a total of 58 probiotic products obtained worldwide, which were claimed to contain bifidobacterium strains (including 22 yoghurts, 5 dairy fruit drinks, 28  food supplements and 3 pharmaceutical preparations) were investigated in parallel using a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. three isolation media previously reported as selective for bifidobacterium were evaluated for their suitability in the quality analysis of these products. subsequently, possible bifidobacterial colonies were picked from the best medium and identified by means of rep-pcr fingerprinting using the box primer (box-pcr). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, formerly classified as bifidobacterium lactis, was most frequently found, but strains belonging to bifidobacterium longum biotypes longum and infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium  breve were recovered also. in parallel, all products were also subjected to culture-independent analysis which involved a nested-pcr step on total bacterial  dna extracted directly from the product, followed by separation of the amplicons  by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and subsequent identification of species from the band patterns. by conventional cultivation, 70.7% of the products analysed were found to contain culturable bifidobacteria whereas by culture-independent dgge analysis members of the genus bifidobacterium could be detected in 96.5% of the analysed products. genotypic characterization of a number of bifidobacterial isolates at the strain level by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a relatively high degree of genomic homogeneity among the bifidobacterium strains currently used in the probiotic industry.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of fecal microbiota in infants, with special reference to bifidobacterium species.
AB  == fecal microbiota of 31 breast-fed, 26 mix-fed, and 11 bottle-fed infants were analyzed by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), and culture method. we first determined the total and cultivated bacterial counts in  infant fecal microbiota. only approximately 30% of bacteria present in fecal microbiota were cultivable while the remainder was yet-to-be cultured bacteria. sixty-eight fecal samples were divided into two clusters (i and ii) by t-rflp analysis, and then subdivided into five subclusters (ia, ib, iia, iib and iic). there was no clear relationship between clusters and feeding method. a proportion of bifidobacteria was detected in the fecal material by pcr method using species-specific primers. the predominant bifidobacterium spp. was bifidobacterium longum longum type (43 samples (63.2%)), followed by b. longum infantis type (23 samples (33.8%)) and b. breve (16 samples (23.5%)). the distribution of bifidobacterium spp. was similar in the three feeding groups. in  contrast, the high incidence of b. breve in cluster i, especially subcluster ia and b. longum longum type in cluster ii, especially subcluster iia and iic were characterized by t-rflp method. our results showed that the colonization of bifidobacterium spp. in infant feces correlated with the t-rflp clusters.

TI  == detection of infant faecal bifidobacteria by enzymatic methods.
AB  == an enzyme-based assay was developed for the detection of bifidobacteria in infant faeces. ninety-five samples from 51 breast-fed infants in the age between 3 and 276 days were investigated. bifidobacteria and other bacterial groups were determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish). faecal samples were examined for the activity of fructoso-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) and for other enzymatic reactions using the api-zym kit. twenty-nine infants had high numbers of bifidobacteria (usually higher than 9 log cfu/g) in their faeces. seventeen infants (35%) did not contain detectable amounts of bifidobacteria in their faecal samples. the remaining five individuals had low counts of bifidobacteria (3-6 log cfu/g). most negative infants possessed major amounts of clostridia in their faecal flora. there were no significant differences among bifidobacterial counts obtained by cultivation and fish, detection of f6ppk, alpha-galactosidase and alpha-glucosidase activities could routinely be used for the rapid and simple detection of bifidobacteria in infant  faecal samples. bifidobacterial colonies were identified using enzymatic tests and pcr procedure based on 16s rrna gene sequences species-specific primers. in 14 samples, the identifications of individual isolates were compared with direct  analyses of faeces using the nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (nested dgge) procedure. the results obtained in several cases are not identical. bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve were most frequently identified. bifidobacteria-positive samples had high activities of alpha-galactosidase and alpha-glucosidase. on the contrary, negative samples missed either one or both of these enzymatic activities. while all positive samples tested showed distinctive  fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity (f6ppk), none of the negative samples expressed f6ppk activity.

TI  == selection of acid tolerant bifidobacteria and evidence for a low-ph-inducible acid tolerance response in bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == acidity is an environmental condition commonly encountered by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and fermented foods. in the present study, 22 strains of bifidobacterium were screened for acid tolerance in artificial gastric juice (agj, ph 3.0) and fermented milk. agj tolerance was found to be strain-specific, with a pronounced variation among the strains. several strains with a high survival rate in agj that belonged to bifid. longum,  bifid. breve and bifid. adolescentis were selected. among them, only strain bl1 of bifid longum was found to possess a high survival rate in fermented milk during refrigerated storage. strain bl1 exhibited a survival rate of more than 25% in agj at ph 3.0 for 2 h and maintained a viable cfu level of more than 10(8) per gram of product in fermented milk (ph 4.6) under refrigerated conditions for  2 weeks. the acid tolerance of strain bl1 was found to depend on the final growth ph (<4.5). rapid loss of acid tolerance was observed when the cells were shifted  from acid to neutral conditions by addition of naoh. strain bl1 cells were able to maintain much higher intracellular ph under acid conditions, in comparison with those of agj sensitive mutant (bl1-s) or cells that lost acid tolerance following ph shifting from acid to neutral conditions. these results suggested that a cytoplasmic ph homeostasis system may function in the acid tolerance response in this strain.

TI  == increased poliovirus-specific intestinal antibody response coincides with promotion of bifidobacterium longum-infantis and bifidobacterium breve in infants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == to determine whether the size of the intestinal bifidobacterial population can influence the immune response to poliovirus vaccination in infants, we set up a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. from birth to 4 mo, infants were given a fermented infant formula (fif) or a standard formula (placebo). bifidobacteria were quantified monthly in infant stools. antipoliovirus iga response to pentacoq was assessed before and 1 mo after the second vaccine injection. thirty infants were randomized, and 20 completed the study (nine in the placebo group and 11 in  the fif group). fecal bifidobacterial level was significantly higher with the fif group at 4 mo of age (p=0.0498). furthermore, b. longum/b. infantis carriage was  higher at 4 mo in the fif group (p=0.0399). antipoliovirus iga titers increased after pentacoq challenge (p <0.001), and the rise was significantly higher in the fif group (p <0.02). antibody titers correlated with bifidobacteria, especially with b. longum/b. infantis and b. breve levels (p <0.002). infants who harbored b. longum/b. infantis also exhibited higher levels of antipoliovirus igas (p <0.002). in conclusion, the present results indicate that antipoliovirus response can be triggered with a fermented formula that is able to favor intestinal bifidobacteria. whether this effect on the immune system is achieved through the  bifidogenic effect of the formula (mainly through b. longum/b. infantis and b. breve stimulation) or directly linked to compounds (i.e. peptides) produced by milk fermentation remains to be investigated.

AB  == we investigated the effects of lactoferrin on the growth of l. acidophilus ch-2,  bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, b. longum atcc 15707, b. infantis atcc 15697, and b. bifidum atcc 15696. the growth of l. acidophilus was stimulated by bovine  holo-lactoferrin but not by apo-lactoferrin. with bifidobacteria, bovine lactoferrin stimulated growth of three strains: b. breve, b. infantis and b. bifidum under certain conditions. both apoprotein and holoprotein had similar effects. however, b. longum growth was not affected by lactoferrin. thus, the mechanism of stimulating growth of bifidobacteria may be different from that of l. acidophilus. by far-western blotting using biotinylated lactoferrin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, lactoferrin-binding proteins were detected in the membrane protein fraction of l. acidophilus, b. bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve. the molecular weights of lactoferrin-binding proteins of l. acidophilus were estimated from sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 27, 41 and 67 kda, and those of the three bifidobacterial strains were estimated  to be 67-69 kda. however, no such lactoferrin-binding components were detected in the membrane fraction of b. longum. it is interesting that the appearance of lactoferrin-binding proteins in the membrane fraction of these species corresponds to their growth stimulation by lactoferrin.

TI  == genus- and species-specific pcr primers for the detection and identification of bifidobacteria.
AB  == 16srdna-targeted genus- and species-specific pcr primers have been developed and  used for the identification and detection of bifidobacteria. these primers cover  all of the described species that inhabit the human gut, or occur in dairy products. identification of cultured bifidobacteria using pcr primer pairs is rapid and accurate, being based on nucleic acid sequences. detection of bifidobacteria can be achieved using dna extracted from human faeces as template  in pcr reactions. we have found that, in adult faeces, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most commonly detected species, followed by bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. in breastfed infants, bifidobacterium breve was the most frequently detected species, followed by bifidobacterium infantis, b. longum and b. bifidum. it was notable that the b. catenulatum group was detected with the highest frequency in adults, although it has often been reported that b. adolescentis is  the most common species. real-time, quantitative pcr using primers targeting 16s  rdna shows promise in the enumeration of bifidobacteria in faecal samples. the approach to detect the target bacteria with quantitative pcr described in this review will contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.

TI  == quantitative detection of probiotic bifidobacterium strains in bacterial mixtures by using real-time pcr.
AB  == strain-specific rrna-targeted primers were designed for the quantitative detection of bifidobacterium infantis y1, b. breve y8 and b. longum y10 used in a pharmaceutical probiotic product (vsl-3). pcr and real-time pcr techniques with the selected primers were employed for the direct enumeration of the bifidobacteria in the probiotic preparation and for studying their kinetic characteristics in batch cultures. these analysis revealed that b. infantis y1 was the predominant strain in the probiotic product and that its growth rate was  the highest. since b. infantis y1, b. breve y8 and b. longum y10 are co-cultured  during the industrial production of vsl-3, the kinetic characteristics of these strains can explain their different concentrations in the probiotic preparation.  a validation of the pcr quantification method was performed by identifying a representative number of isolates from the bacterial mixtures with automated ribotyping. the methodology described represents a useful tool for the specific quantitative detection of bacterial strains and species in complex mixtures such  as pharmaceutical preparations, dairy starter cultures, faecal samples and biopsies.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == stimulation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == to characterize the ability of bifidobacteria to affect the production of macrophage-derived cytokines, a murine macrophage-like cell line, j774.1, was cultured in the presence of 27 strains of heat-inactivated bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium adolescentis and b. longum, known as adult-type bifidobacteria, induced significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, il-12 and tnf-alpha, by j774.1 cells, than did the infant-type bifidobacteria, b. bifidum,  b. breve, and b. infantis (p<0.01). in contrast, b. adolescentis did not stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory il-10 from j774.1 cells as the other tested bacteria did. the results suggest that the adult-type bifidobacteria, especially b. adolescentis, may be more potent to amplify but less able to down-regulate the inflammatory response.

TI  == specific growth rate of bifidobacteria cultured on different sugars.
AB  == the ability of six bifidobacterial strains (3 of human origin and 3 isolates from fermented milk products) to utilize glucose, lactose, melezitose, sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose was determined. dairy-related bifidobacterial strains were identified as bifidobacterium animalis (2 strains) or as b. pseudolongum (1  strain). human strains included b. longum (2 strains) and b. breve (1 strain). all strains fermented lactose, sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose. melezitose was  utilized only by b. longum. b. pseudolongum did not ferment either glucose or melezitose. all isolates had a higher specific growth rate on raffinose and stachyose than on glucose. dairy strain grew slowly on glucose compared to human  strains.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == 2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone affects the end-product profile of bifidobacteria through the mediated oxidation of nad(p)h.
AB  == glucose metabolism of bifidobacteria in the presence of 2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (acnq), a specific growth stimulator for bifidobacteria, and ferricyanide (fe(cn)(6)(3-)) as an extracellular electron acceptor was examined using resting cells of bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve. nad(p)h in the cells is oxidized by acnq with the aid of diaphorase activity, and reduced acnq donates the electron to fe(cn)(6)(3-). exogenous oxidation of nadh by the acnq/fe(cn)(6)(3-) system suppresses the endogenous lactate dehydrogenase reaction competitively, which results in the remarkable generation of pyruvate and a decrease in lactate production. in addition, a decrease in acetate generation is also observed in the presence of acnq and fe(cn)(6)(3-). this phenomenon could not be explained in terms of the fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase pathway, but suggests rather that glucose is partially metabolized via the hexose monophosphate pathway. this was verified by  nadp(+)-induced reduction of fe(cn)(6)(3-) in cell-free extracts in the presence  of acnq. effects of the acnq/fe(cn)(6)(3-) system on anaerobically harvested cells were also examined. stoichiometric analysis of the metabolites from the pyruvate-formate lyase pathway suggests that exogenous oxidation of nadh is an efficient method to produce atp in this pathway.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == basic features of the stress response in three species of bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. adolescentis, and b. breve.
AB  == the presence of the dnak heat shock gene could be demonstrated for b. longum ncc481, b. longum ncc490, b. longum ncc585, b. adolescentis ncc251, and b. breve  ncc298. induction of dnak on the transcriptional level was shown for ncc251 and ncc481 by increasing temperatures. ncc251 showed an additional chaperone-induction after salt or bile-salt treatment. in both strains preconditioning with bile-salts protected against otherwise lethal concentrations thereof. ncc251 when subjected to a heat stress was able to survive an otherwise  lethal temperature (55 degrees c). cross-protection was demonstrated for ncc251 since salt pretreatment resulted in increased tolerance after freeze-thawing cycles or lethal heat stress.

TI  == metabolization of beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides by different bifidobacteria.
AB  == low-molecular-mass beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides (beta-(2,6)-fos) were examined as a new carbohydrate source for growth of bifidobacteria. beta-(2,6)-fos were prepared from microbial high-molecular-mass levan by acid hydrolysis and refined by cation-exchange chromatography. (13)c-nmr spectroscopy  confirmed the presence of predominantly beta-(2,6)-fructosyl linkages in the oligosaccharides. more than 80% beta-(2,6)-fos was recovered after in vitro incubation with amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, implying resistance to degradation in the upper intestinal tract. bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. longum, b. breve, and b. pseudocatenulatum were studied in vitro for their ability to metabolize beta-(2,6)-fos. growth, decrease in ph, formation of short- chain fatty acids (lactate, acetate, formate) and degradation of beta-(2,6)-fos were markedly different among species. b. adolescentis showed the best growth, produced the highest amounts of organic acids and metabolized both short- and long-chain beta-(2, 6)-fos.

TI  == distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  == in order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific pcr technique was developed and used with dnas extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. to cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for bifidobacterium longum, b. infantis, b. dentium, and b. gallicum were developed and used with primers for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, and the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, r. tanaka, and h. oyaizu, fems microbiol. lett. 167:113-121, 1998). the specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by pcr, and the species-specific pcr method was found to be a useful means for identifying bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. the results of an examination  of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the b. catenulatum group was  the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by b. longum and b. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and  that b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. the present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

TI  == rapid identification of human intestinal bifidobacteria by 16s rrna-targeted species- and group-specific primers.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacteria by random dna amplification.
AB  == rapd conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat dna analysis and separate dna extractions. five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum. the use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the rapd method for  the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. the results indicated that  this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their rapd profiles. using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of bifidobacterium (b. breve, b. bifidum and b. adolescentis),  based on similarity of the rapd profiles to known reference strains. furthermore, application of the rapd technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either b. longum/infantis or b. animalis/lactis).

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == effect of bifidogenic factors on growth characteristics of bifidobacteria in infant formulas.
AB  == a bifidogenic factor, lactulose or fructooligosaccharides, was added (0.5%) into  infant formula based on soy or infant formula with hydrolyzed casein. the infant  formulas were then inoculated (2.5%) with bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 15696), bifidobacterium breve (atcc 15700), bifidobacterium infantis (atcc 15697), or bifidobacterium longum (atcc 15708) or their mixture (mixed culture) and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. lactulose did not influence maximal counts or generation times in either formula for any species except b. infantis, which had  lower counts. trends of developed acidity and ph of the mixed culture in the infant formulas with or without lactulose were similar to those for b. breve. maximal counts and generation times remained unchanged with or without fructooligosaccharides for all species and the mixed culture, except for b. bifidum in the formula based on soy, for which maximal counts did not occur. growth in either formula was inhibited for b. infantis with lactulose and b. breve with fructooligosaccharides past 8 h of inoculation.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).

TI  == characterization of dairy-related bifidobacterium spp. based on their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns.
AB  == numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics based on enzymatic activity and  carbohydrate fermentation allowed the discrimination of most strains of bifidobacteria of animal origin from those of human origin. strains of bifidobacteria studied were separated into nine groups based on numerical analysis. three groups contained most strains of animal origin, three groups comprised both strains of animal and human origin, and three groups were strictly composed of strains of human origin. the results indicate that one group of animal origin (group ii) contained all reference strains of bifidobacterium animals and 10 strains isolated from fermented milks or commercial preparations.  although numerical analysis of enzymatic activities and carbohydrate fermentation patterns allowed the differentiation of 'wild' strains of b. animalis and b. longum isolated from commercial preparations, this method failed to confirm the species. in the present study, the determination of electrophoretic patterns of beta-galactosidases resulted in the development of a new technique for the differentiation of bifidobacterium species. several isoenzymes of beta-galactosidase were detected among strains of bifidobacteria. each species had a specific electrophoretic pattern. the detection of beta-galactosidase by electrophoresis is a new tool for distinguishing between dairy- and non-dairy-related bifidobacteria. dairy-related bifidobacteria (b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum) as well as b. animalis could be better differentiated from other bifidobacteria by comparison of their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns, rather than by numerical analysis of their phenotypic characteristics.

AB  == bifidobacteria, which are obligate anaerobes, were studied to determine the relationship between their sensitivity to oxygen and oxygen metabolism. among the four species tested, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium longum differed from bifidobacterium adolescentis in sensitivity  to oxygen. the former three species showed marked growth under conditions of partial aeration, whereas the growth of b. adolescentis was suppressed by low concentrations of oxygen. bifidobacteria express reduced nad-oxidase and -peroxidase activities, which function in a pathway for two-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide and, subsequently, water. activities of reduced nad-oxidase and -peroxidase were inversely correlated with  their sensitivities to oxygen. bifidobacterium adolescentis exhibited lowered activities of these two enzymes; the activities were 10 to 20% of those observed  with b. infantis, b. breve, and b. longum. these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that reduced nad-oxidase and reduced nad-peroxidase in bifidobacterium species play a role in prevention of oxygen toxicity. superoxide  dismutase activity was also detected in bifidobacterium species. superoxide dismutase is probably not involved in detoxification of oxygen, because the activity of this enzyme was extremely low, and the sensitivity to oxygen varied independently of superoxide dismutase activity.

TI  == species-specific oligonucleotide probes for five bifidobacterium species detected in human intestinal microflora.
AB  == portions of the 16s rrna from closely related species of the genus bifidobacterium that are found in the human intestinal microflora were sequenced  in order to design species-specific oligonucleotide probes. five oligonucleotide  probes ranging from 16 to 19 bases in length and complementary to 16s rrna sequences from bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were synthesized. with crude high-molecular-weight rna preparations as targets, these probes showed the desired species specificity, even down to a 1-nucleotide difference. for the practical evaluation of these probes, their specificity and sensitivity were tested against seven strains of the same species and 54 strains of heterologous bacteria with fixed whole cells as targets. the probes for b. adolescentis, b. breve, and b. longum showed efficient and specific hybridization. although the probes for b. bifidum and b. infantis cross-reacted with a few bacterial strains not isolated from humans, these probes showed species specificity for human intestinal bacteria. these 16s rrna probes should prove valuable for the identification and detection of human intestinal bifidobacterium species.

TI  == transient colonization of the gut of newborn infants by orally administered bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  == we investigated if orally administered bifidobacteria and/or lactobacilli could be cultured from faeces of infants after antibiotic treatment, when these bacterial species are usually absent. lyophilized bifidobacterium longum, strain  bb-536, b. breve, strain bb-576, or lactobacillus acidophilus, strain lac-343, were used. doses of 3 x 10(9) cells of one strain, or a mixture of all three strains 3 x 10(9) cells each were fed three times daily at mealtimes to 11 infants aged 0-8 weeks. treatment was started the first day after antibiotic treatment and was continued for 5 days. the bacterial species were isolated in 9  of 11, 7 of 10 and 2 of 9 specimens obtained on the last day of bifidobacteria or lactobacilli administration, 5 and 15 days thereafter, respectively. no side effects were noted.

TI  == [the biological properties of bifidobacterium].
AB  == the possibility of the formation of exoenzymes, such as dnaase, rnaase and hemolysin, by bifidobacteria was studied in comparison with their acid-forming and adhesive activity. bifidobacterium reference strains, originally isolated from healthy adults and children, were studied. the study involved altogether 73  strains of bifidobacteria, including 24 b. bifidum strains, 13 b. adolescentis strains, 7 b. infantis strains, 10 b. breve strains and 19 b. longum strains. the bifidobacteria under study were shown to differ not only in the presence and activity of properties useful for macroorganisms, but also in the presence of enzymes having depolymerizing activity (dnaase, hemolysin). thus, out of 73 strains under study 9 proved to be dnaase-positive and 6, hemolysin positive. at  the same time a specific feature of bifidobacteria was their high acid-forming activity with the complete absence of rnaase activity and insignificant dnaase- and hemolysin-forming activity.

TI  == comparison of carbohydrate substrate preferences in eight species of bifidobacteria.
AB  == eight species of bifidobacteria were tested for their abilities to grow on a range of monosaccharides (glucose, arabinose, xylose, galactose and mannose). in  contrast to the other sugars, glucose and galactose were utilized by all species  and, in general, specific growth rates were highest on these sugars. different substrate preferences were observed between species when the bacteria were grown  in the presence of all five monosaccharides. for example, glucose and xylose were coutilized by bifidobacterium longum, whereas glucose repressed uptake of all other sugars in b. bifidum and b. catenulatum. galactose was the preferred substrate with b. pseudolongum. in b. angulatum, glucose and galactose were utilized simultaneously. b. breve did not grow on arabinose when this sugar provided the sole source of energy. however, glucose and arabinose were preferentially taken up during growth on sugar mixtures.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.

TI  == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans.  the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI  == uncoupling of growth and acids production in bifidobacterium ssp.
AB  == kinetics of batch cultivation of four species of bifidobacterium in milk were examined in detail. bifidobacteria could grow well in milk inoculated with cultures prepared in a synthetic medium. cessation of growth occurred, however, in ph-controlled batch cultures, although incomplete utilization of lactose was observed. lactate and acetate accumulation caused limitation on growth of bifidobacteria leading to an uncoupling of biomass and product formation. from 70 to 75% of both final lactate and acetate concentrations were produced during the  stationary growth phase of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium longum cultivated in milk, whereas bifidobacterium infantis produced less acetate or lactate during this phase.

TI  == growth promotion of bifidobacterium species by whey and casein fractions from human and bovine milk.
AB  == an in vitro assay was used to study the growth-promotional activity of human milk (hm), cow's milk (cm), and whey and casein fractions of hm and cm for five strains of bifidobacterium species isolated originally from stools of human infants. whey- and casein-predominant cm-based infant formulas were studied as well. when compared on an equivalent protein basis, the growth promotion activity of hm was greater than that of cm for bifidobacterium bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and bifidobacterium longum but comparable for b. bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium breve. pasteurization of hm and cm  resulted in an increase of growth promotion activity for b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and b. bifidum, a decrease for b. infantis, and no change for b. longum and b. breve. the growth promotion activity of hm whey was slightly higher than that of hm casein for four strains of bifidobacteria. when cm casein was a substrate, virtually no growth occurred for b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. longum. the growth promotion activity of cm whey, however, was similar to that of hm whey. a similar trend was observed for cm-based infant formula. whey-dominant formulas promoted better growth of b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, b. bifidum, and b. infantis than casein-dominant  formulas. the data suggest a direct relationship between amount of whey-specific  factors and the ability to promote growth of clinically relevant strains of bifidobacterium species by hm, cm, and cm-based infant formulas.

TI  == structure of macroamphiphiles from several bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid-like substances, macroamphiphiles, were isolated from cell homogenates of bifidobacterium bifidum yit 4007 and yit 4013, bifidobacterium breve yit 4010 and yit 4014, and bifidobacterium longum yit 4021 by phenol extraction followed by nuclease digestion, gel chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. the macroamphiphile preparations from these five strains contained d-glucose, d-galactose, glycerol,  phosphorus, l-alanine, and fatty acids in molar ratios of 1.00, 1.57 to 1.95, 1.02 to 1.99, 0.97 to 1.72, 0.15 to 0.46, and 0.16 to 0.43. data from structural  analyses including methylation, 1h nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, alkaline hydrolysis, mild acid hydrolysis, and hydrogen fluoride treatment led to the most likely common structure for the macroamphiphiles of the examined strains, (formula; see text) where gro-p is glycerophosphate, m is the number of  repeating units of galactofuranan, and n is the number of repeating units of glucan. whereas the polymers from the respective strains differed in the numbers  of repeating units of the galactofuranan and glucan moieties and in the number of fatty acid residues, the proposed structure is essentially the same as that reported previously for the macroamphiphile of b. bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum dsm 20239 by w. fischer (eur. j. biochem. 165:639-646, 1987).

TI  == structural studies of cell wall polysaccharides from bifidobacterium breve yit 4010 and related bifidobacterium species.
AB  == the chemical compositions of the cell walls obtained from 8 strains in 5 species  of bifidobacterium were analyzed. these cell walls were shown to be composed of peptidoglycan and polysaccharide moieties. some variations with respect to contents of neutral sugars and content of phosphorus were observed with some cell wall preparations from the same species. the neutral polysaccharides in cell walls of 4 strains of bifidobacterium (b. bifidum yit 4007, b. breve yit 4010, b. infantis yit 4025, and b. longum atcc 15707) were purified and their chemical structures were analyzed. one of these polysaccharides, obtained from b. breve yit 4010, was analyzed in detail by glc, 1h- and 13c-nmr spectroscopic analyses,  methylation, smith degradation and acetolysis, and the results suggested the following structure for the repeating unit of the polysaccharide: (formula: see text).
