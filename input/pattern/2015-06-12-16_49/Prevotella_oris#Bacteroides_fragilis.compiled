TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.
AB  - In total 122 non-duplicate Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. Most of the strains belonged to the B. fragilis group (55%), followed by Prevotella strains (34.4%) and Fusobacterium spp (10.6%). The species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. The most common isolates were B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Among Prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were P. buccae, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. denticola and P. nigrescens, and most of the Fusobacterium spp. were F. nucleatum. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the E-test methodology. The percentage of the susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (MIC </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. Three B. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). All Prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented Prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 mug/ml). The susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. All Fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.
TI  - Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli
AB  - At present there are over two dozen genera of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. In most clinical infections, only the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium need be considered. These genera are prevalent in the body as members of the normal flora (Fig.20-1), constituting one-third of the total anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens, and may become involved in infections throughout the body (Fig.20-2). Within the Bacteroides group, B fragilis is the most common pathogen, followed by B thetaiotaomicron and other members of the B fragilis group. Among the bile-sensitive Prevotella species, the ones most commonly encountered clinically are P melaninogenica, P oris, and P buccae. Porphyromonas species seem to be much less pathogenic except in dental infections. Fusobacterium nucleatum is the Fusobacterium species most often found as a pathogen, but F necrophorum occasionally produces serious disease. These genera contain numerous other species that rarely or never infect humans.
TI  - Bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  - A case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. A CT scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A culture from a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and Staphylococcus simulans. From the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and some Prevotella buccae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. No aerobes were present. The patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. The antimicrobial therapy included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. The result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. This is the first documentation of isolation of B. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Multivariate analyses of fatty acid data from whole-cell methanolysates of Prevotella, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas spp.
AB  - The genus Bacteroides contains a number of biochemically and physiologically heterogeneous groups of organisms and needs taxonomic revision. In this study cellular fatty acids from a number of Bacteroides spp. were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chemical data were then subjected to principal components analysis. In B. fragilis, which is the type species of the genus Bacteroides, C3-OH-iso17 was the predominant fatty acid (38.0%) and Cante15 was present in higher amounts (32.7%) than Ciso15 (14.6%). B. fragilis thus differed from all the other species examined: Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, P. (B.) oralis, P. (B.) oris, P. (B.) disiens, P. (B.) veroralis, P. (B.) heparinolytica and Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) endodontalis. Principal components analysis also enabled the closely related P. buccae, P. oralis and P. oris to be differentiated.
TI  - Multivariate analyses of cellular fatty acids in Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Wolinella, and Campylobacter spp.
AB  - The genera Bacteroides, Wolinella, and Campylobacter contain several similar species that require taxonomic revision. Fatty acid profiles of whole bacterial cells have proven useful for taxonomy. In this study, cellular fatty acids from Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Wolinella, and Campylobacter spp. were identified and quantitated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the data were subjected to principal component analyses. Bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus Bacteroides, was distinct from the other organisms. While Bacteroides gracilis, Wolinella succinogenes, Wolinella curva, Wolinella recta, and Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis were close to each other, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Prevotella oralis, Prevotella oris, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella veroralis, Prevotella heparinolyticus, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) endodontalis, and Bacteroides ureolyticus could be distinguished. B. fragilis was characterized by the presence of C3OH-i-1-, Ca-15, and Ci-15 and the absence of C12:0 and unsaturated fatty acids. For comparison, B. gracilis, B. ureolyticus, W. succinogenes, W. curva, W. recta, and Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis contained C12:0, C16:1, C18:1, and C3-OH-14 acids but lacked branched hydroxy and branched nonhydroxy acids. B. gracilis and B. ureolyticus are not "true" bacteroides.
