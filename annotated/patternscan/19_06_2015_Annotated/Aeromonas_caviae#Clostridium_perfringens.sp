TI  == occurrence of motile aeromonas in municipal drinking water and distribution of genes encoding virulence factors.
AB  == aeromonas-associated cases of gastroenteritis are generally considered waterborne. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential microbiological risk associated with the presence of these bacteria in public drinking water. over a period of one year, 132 drinking-water samples were monitored in leon (nw of spain, 137,000 inhabitants) for mandatory drinking-water standards and the occurrence of aeromonas spp. samples were taken at the municipal water treatment plant, one storage facility, and two public artesian drinking-water fountains. because of low numbers of coliforms or clostridium perfringens, the non-compliance rate with microbial standards was 3.8% whereas the percentage of positive samples for motile mesophilic aeromonas was 26.5%. for all but two samples, aeromonas was recovered between october and early march when the temperature was below 14 degrees c and the residual chlorine ranged from 0.21 to 0.72 mg/l. an apparent relationship was observed between rainfall and the incidence of aeromonas. the 35 selected aeromonas isolates were identified as a.  caviae and a. media. the alt and laf genes were present in all isolates, the aera gene was present in six isolates, and the four remaining genes investigated (hlya, ast, stx1 and stx2) were absent. the combinations of putative virulence genes were: aera(-)/hlya(-)/alt(+)/ast(-)/laf(+)/stx1(-)/stx2(-) (82.9%) and aera(+)/hlya(-)/alt(+)/ast(-)/laf(+)/stx1(-)/stx2(-) (17.1%). none of the isolates bore plasmids. as aeromonas strains harbouring two or more virulence-associated genes have the potential to cause disease by direct transmission via drinking water or by water use in food preparation, it would be  advisable to control excessive numbers of these bacteria in drinking-water supplies.

TI  == evaluation of the synergistic haemolysis (camp-like) test in the identification of motile, mesophilic aeromonas species.
AB  == usefulness of the synergistic haemolysis (camp-like) test in the identification of aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria, and aeromonas caviae was evaluated, using beta-toxin producing staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and alpha-toxin producing clostridium perfringens atcc 13124 as sphingomyelinase producing indicator strains. the tests were done on columbia blood agar base supplemented with 5% sheep blood (cba; difco laboratories, detroit, mi, usa). when cultured aerobically, 77% of a. hydrophila isolates, 75% of a. sobria isolates, and 23% of a. caviae isolates elicited synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes with the beta-toxin producing strain of s. aureus. anaerobically, using the same indicator strain, synergistic haemolysis was given by 91%, 51% and 82% of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae, respectively. when alpha-toxin producing c. perfringens was used in the test instead of beta-toxin producing s. aureus, 100%, 86%, and 93% of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae isolates, respectively, showed synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. due to the high number of the tested isolates of a. hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae giving a positive synergistic haemolysis reaction in both atmospheric conditions of culture, this test cannot be used to identify any of the three aeromonas spp. the use of alpha-toxin producing c. perfringens did not improve discriminatory power of the  test. because the nature of the product of aeromonas spp. responsible for the lytic phenomenon is not known, the use of aeromonas factor and synergistic haemolysis terms was proposed rather than camp (reaction, test) or camp (-like) factor.
