a new antimicrobial and anticancer peptide producing by the marine deep sediment  strain "paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. sl 79.
a new linear glyceryl acid derived heptapeptide (1), together with known isocoumarin antibiotic, y-05460m-a (2), were isolated from the culture of the deep sea sediment strain si 79 classified as "paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. their structures were determined by 1d- and 2d- nmr techniques and esi-ms/ms experiments. hplc analysis of the marfey derivatives in comparison to their analogs of authentic amino acids revealed that all amino acids in peptide 1, with an exception of val, have the d-configuration. the compound 1 showed inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium as well as cytotoxic and moderate colony growth inhibitory activity against sk-mel-28 cell line.
antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium fair-e 198 inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 au ml(-1)). however, none of the b. cereus and s. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. the maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 au ml(-1)) was observed in mrs broth, while the activity in milk was 100 au ml(-1). in the co-cultivation test in milk, b. cereus k1-b041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log cfu ml(-1)) after 48 h. e. faecium reduced the initial l. monocytogenes scott a population by 1 log cfu ml(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees c, however, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. e. faecium did not influence the growth of s. aureus atcc 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium fair-e 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
antilisterial activity of a broad-spectrum bacteriocin, enterocin lr/6 from enterococcus faecium lr/6.
enterocin lr/6, a purified bacteriocin, exhibited broad inhibitory spectrum both  against related as well as some food-borne pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas sp., shigella sp., and bacillus licheniformis. in this investigation, we have focused on l. monocytogenes as the target organism, as it is not only an important pathogen but can also survive over a wide range of environmental conditions such as refrigeration temperature, low ph, and high-salt concentration. this allows the pathogen to overcome many food preservation and safety barriers and poses a potential risk to human health. the enterocin lr/6 showed a bactericidal action against l. monocytogenes and completely inhibited the growth on agar plates, supplemented with 200 au/ml of enterocin lr/6. the effectiveness of enterocin lr/6 in completely killing a population of acid-adapted (ph 5.2, 2 h) l. monocytogenes exposed to different temperatures (4-37 degrees c), ph (2.5-8.0), and osmotic (up to 30% nacl) stress is reported here. this paper focuses on the key issue of killing of the acid-adapted l. monocytogenes cells under adverse environmental conditions.
partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by environmental strain enterococcus faecium ek13.
aims: the partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by an environmental strain enterococcus faecium ek13, isolated from cattle dung water. methods and results: a bacteriocin was partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by a sp-sepharose column, reverse-phase chromatography and n-terminal region sequenced. the anti-microbial substance produced was found to be a heat-stable polypeptide with molecular mass 4.83 kda, which was determined by n-terminal amino acid sequencing to be enterocin a. a second substance was specified by pcr as enterocin p. bacteriocins were stable at 4 and -20 degrees c for long storage periods. the optimum of bacteriocin production was observed in the range of ph 5.0-6.5 at 30 and 37 degrees c. the most active substances are produced by strain ek13 in logarithmic growth phase and bacteriocins are produced after 1 h of fermentation. the highest activity detected in fermentation experiments was 51 200 au ml(-1) and the most sensitive indicator strain was found to be listeria innocua lmg 13568. differences in bacteriocin activity against two indicators could be explained by more than one type of enterocin production by strain ek13, or with different mode of action or in different sensitivity of strains. conclusion: enterococcus faecium strain ek13 isolated from cattle dung water produces two bacteriocins, enterocin a and p, with an inhibitory effect against the strain of the genera enterococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, streptococcus, staphylococcus, bacillus and listeria (in different origin). significance and impact of the study: enterococcus faecium ek13 environmental strain is a new producer of enterocin a and p. the e. faecium ek13, isolated from cattle dung water, is presented with the further aim to utilize it for waste treatment by biotechnological processes.
in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.
