TI  - Prevalence of the genital tract bacterial infections after vaginal reconstructive surgery.
AB  - Due to frequent childbirth, heavy lifting and the structure of the lives of rural women in Shahrekord region, Iran, cystocele and rectocele are of the main medical problems of the women in this area and for its correction, vaginal reconstructive surgery is needed which causes infection. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria causing infection after vaginal reconstructive surgery and performing antibiogram to help these patients for faster recovery. Patients enrolled this study were 92 who had undergone previous vaginal reconstructive surgery and now had infection. After examination, the group of patients taking antibiotics (n = 26) were excluded and the remaining 66 completed the study questionnaire. A gynecologist performed sampling; related tests (aerobic and anaerobic culture using an anaerobic culture gas pack jar and type A which provides absolute anaerobic conditions) were performed; antimicrobial susceptibility testing using Disk Diffusion Method was carried out; and the results were recorded. All the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gardnerella vaginalis in 20 cases (31%), peptostreptococci and anaerobic cocci in 9 cases (13.6%), staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases (9.1%), bacteroides and fusobacterium in 7 cases (10.6%), streptococcus group B in 4 cases (6%), yeast cells in 11 cases (16.6%) and Trichomonas vaginalis in wet mount of 4 (6%) existed. Anaerobic bacteria showed 85% sensitivity to clindamycin, 82% to chloramphenicol, 85% sensitivity to ceftizoxime and 45% to penicillin. Facultative anaerobic bacteria showed a sensitivity rate of 90% to ceftizoxime, chloramphenicol and cephalothin. According to our findings, the rate of vaginal bacterial infection in women with vaginal reconstructive surgery has increased; from which, infections with anaerobic bacteria origins have increased dramatically. We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis prior to genital reconstructive surgeries.
TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - The cytolytic activity of vaginolysin strictly depends on cholesterol and is potentiated by human CD59.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis produces cytolysin vaginolysin (VLY), which has been suggested to be a contributor to bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis. VLY along with intermedilysin (ILY) from Streptococcus intermedius have been attributed to a group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) whose pore-forming activity depends on human CD59 (hCD59). Here, we show that different types of cells lacking hCD59 are susceptible to VLY-mediated lysis, albeit to different extents. We analyze the effects of both hCD59 and cholesterol on VLY cytolytic activity. We show that VLY binds to cholesterol-rich membranes of non-human cells, while VLY with an impaired cholesterol recognition site retains binding to the hCD59-containing cells. We further demonstrate that cholesterol binding by VLY is sufficient to trigger the formation of oligomeric complexes on cholesterol rich-liposomes lacking hCD59. Thus, VLY may induce cell lysis following two alternative pathways. One requires only cholesterol and does not depend on hCD59. The second pathway involves hCD59 contribution similarly to ILY. Apparently, under physiological conditions VLY acts in the most effective way by accepting the assistance of hCD59.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Human-specific bacterial pore-forming toxins induce programmed necrosis in erythrocytes.
AB  - A subgroup of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family of pore-forming toxins (PFTs) has an unusually narrow host range due to a requirement for binding to human CD59 (hCD59), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked complement regulatory molecule. hCD59-specific CDCs are produced by several organisms that inhabit human mucosal surfaces and can act as pathogens, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus intermedius. The consequences and potential selective advantages of such PFT host limitation have remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, PFT ligation of hCD59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing hCD59. Because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, RBCs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. RBC programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on Fas/FasL signaling and RIP1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. Death due to programmed necrosis in RBCs is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, NADPH oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products. Bacterial PFTs that are hCD59 independent do not induce RBC programmed necrosis. RBC programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature RBCs. Importantly, RBC programmed necrosis enhances the growth of PFT-producing pathogens during exposure to primary RBCs, consistent with a role for such signaling in microbial growth and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: In this work, we provide the first description of a new form of programmed cell death in erythrocytes (RBCs) that occurs as a consequence of cellular attack by human-specific bacterial toxins. By defining a new RBC death pathway that shares important components with necroptosis, a programmed necrosis module that occurs in nucleated cells, these findings expand our understanding of RBC biology and RBC-pathogen interactions. In addition, our work provides a link between cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) host restriction and promotion of bacterial growth in the presence of RBCs, which may provide a selective advantage to human-associated bacterial strains that elaborate such toxins and a potential explanation for the narrowing of host range observed in this toxin family.
TI  - Silver sucrose octasulfate (IASOS) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  - This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.
TI  - The diversity of receptor recognition in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are bacterial pore-forming toxins secreted mainly by pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. CDCs generally recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol to create pores and lyse target cells. However, in contrast to typical CDCs such as streptolysin O, several atypical CDCs have been reported. The first of these was intermedilysin, which is secreted by Streptococcus intermedius and has human cell-specificity, human CD59 (huCD59) being its receptor. In the study reported here, the diversity of receptor recognition among CDCs was investigated and multi-receptor recognition characteristics were identified within this toxin family. Streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (Sm-hPAF) secreted by S. mitis strain Nm-65 isolated from a patient with Kawasaki disease was previously shown to hemolyze erythrocytes in a species-dependent manner, its maximum activity being in human cells. In the present study, it was found that Sm-hPAF recognizes both membrane cholesterol and huCD59 as receptors for triggering pore-formation. Moreover, vaginolysin (VLY) of Gardnerella vaginalis showed similar characteristics to Sm-hPAF regarding receptor recognition. On the basis of the results presented here, the mode of receptor recognition of CDCs can be categorized into the following three groups: (i) Group I, comprising typical CDCs with high affinity to cholesterol and no or very little affinity to huCD59; (ii) Group II, including atypical CDCs such as ILY, with no or very little affinity to cholesterol and high affinity to huCD59; and (iii) Group III, which contains atypical CDCs such as Sm-hPAF and VLY with affinity to both cholesterol and huCD59.
TI  - Tissue-specific IL-10 secretion profile from term human fetal membranes stimulated with pathogenic microorganisms associated with preterm labor in a two-compartment tissue culture system.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-10 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties that plays pivotal roles in immune recognition and maintenance of pregnancy, limiting the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory modulators. The aim of this work was to characterize the contribution of amnion and choriodecidua regions of the human fetal membranes in the production of IL-10 after selective stimulation with Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus agalactiae. METHODS: Pre-labor human fetal membranes were cultured in a two-compartment tissue culture system and stimulated with 1 x 10(6) CFU/ml of each pathogen added to either the amniotic or choriodecidual region or both. RESULTS: Candida albicans and G. vaginalis were the pathogens most effective in inducing IL-10 secretion, increasing 20 and 10 times, respectively, the levels of this cytokine in the choriodecidual compartment. Stimulation with S. agalactiae was effective only in the choriodecidual region, increasing two times IL-10 concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Synthesis and secretion of IL-10 in response to three different pathogens associated with intrauterine infection and preterm birth are differential and depend on the nature of the microorganism and initial contact region.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Profiles of ILY, VLY and Sm-hPAF interaction with human CD59.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular features of a new member of the bacterially -derived cytolysin family were examined. In particular, the interactive mechanisms of intermedilysin (ILY), vaginolysin (VLY), and Streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (Sm-hPAF) with human CD59 (hCD59) were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular models of VLY and Sm-hPAF were constructed based on X-ray data of ILY (protein data bank ID=1S3R), and their interactive profiles with hCD59 were examined using molecular simulation. RESULTS: Non-binding (NB) energy between ILY and hCD59 was three orders of magnitude higher than the energy between VLY and hCD59. NB energy between Sm-hPAF and hCD59 was similar to that between VLY and hCD59. CONCLUSION: A hydrogen bond (ILY Arg432-hCD59 Glu76) was observed between ILY and hCD59, and a stronger interaction was formed by flexible adjustment between them.
TI  - [Vaginal infections in pregnant women at the Regional Hospital of Sokode (Togo) in 2010 and 2011].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the major microorganisms causing vaginal infections in pregnant women consulting at the Regional Hospital of Sokode and to assess their sensitivity to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study took place from June 2010 through August 2011 and included 302 pregnant women from whom a sample was taken by a vaginal swab. Samples were processed for parasitic, bacterial, and fungal agents, by microscopic examination and culture. RESULTS: We isolated 273 germs, alone or in association in 221 women. These germs were distributed as follows: Gardnerella vaginalis (55.31%), Candida spp (30.77%), Staphylococcus aureus (5.49%), Enterobacteriaceae (4.40%), Trichomonas vaginalis (3.66%) and Mobiluncus spp (0.37%). No Streptococcus strain was isolated during the study. Over 40% of women had bacterial vaginosis and 23.08% of them were coinfected. The occurrence of coinfection was statistically influenced by the stage of pregnancy (P = 0.05). The susceptibility tests revealed that S. aureus developed a strong resistance to aminopenicillins (66.67%) and cephalosporins (>44.44%), while Enterobacteriaceae was resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones. (16.67%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that pregnant women in Sokode are still exposed to vaginal infection, caused mostly by G. vaginalis and Candida species. These results underline the need for at least one vaginal swab culture for each woman during pregnancy.
TI  - A deeper analysis of the epitope/paratope of PLY-5, a mouse monoclonal antibody which recognises the conserved undecapeptide tryptophan-rich loop (ECTGLAWEWWR) of bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - A previous study showed that the minimal epitope recognised by the PLY-5 mAb in the conserved undecapeptide Trp-rich loop of bacterial CDCs should consist of WEWWRT (Jacobs et al., 1999) [5]. Now, through immunoscreening of amino acid substitution analogues, it is concluded that the second Trp and the Arg residues are essential in the PLY-5 epitope. The E residue is an auxiliary epitope contributor. Antibody modelling and docking simulations provided support for these findings. For recognition by the antibody, the Trp-rich loop flipped out, mimicking the mechanism of membrane insertion. The displaced second Trp was seen to establish aromatic stacking interactions with aromatic residues of the antibody paratope and the notably extruded guanidium tip of the arginine residue mediated electrostatic interactions with well-exposed carboxylic groups of glutamic residues on the surface of the paratope. Thus, the epitope/paratope interaction is mainly mediated by aromatic and by ionic interactions.
TI  - Simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  - Our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assay. We have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. In this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. The 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. Two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. The method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. In a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in Sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the 14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.
TI  - Bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane Toll-like receptor expression.
AB  - PROBLEM: Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pPROM) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (PTB) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection and inflammation. The membranes may sense and respond to microbes via Toll-like receptors (TLRs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation in this tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and PTB. METHOD OF STUDY: Normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. After 24 hrs, RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR performed for TLRs1-10. RESULTS: Treatment of fetal membranes with Mycoplasma hominis increased expression of TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8 mRNA. Ureaplasma parvum upregulated TLR8 mRNA, and Porphyromonas gingivalis significantly increased fetal membrane TLR7 expression. In contrast, treatment with Gram-negative Escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated TLR10 mRNA. No effect was detected for Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Group B Streptococcus. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane TLR expression patterns. Moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pPROM and PTB, arise.
TI  - [Possible role of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  - Vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. It is due to several causes, some even unknown. Bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. They have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. The identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. In 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Candida albicans, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Streptococcus agalactiae. B. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. These strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees C in anaerobe chambers. Supernatant activity was assayed in HT-29 cells. Eighteen B. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. It was not identified in healthy women (P < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. This fact suggests that enterotoxigenic B. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. The effect of enterotoxin on E-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. This is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.
TI  - Characterization of low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide from human female  reproductive tract.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms that protect female upper genital tract from ascending infection by microbes present in vagina are only partially understood. It is expected that epithelial cells in mucosal surfaces and their secretions directly interfere with microbial colonization and invasion. This study was aimed to demonstrate the expression of 2 kDa antimicrobial peptide which was identified and purified from female genital tract tissues using chromatographic techniques. METHODS: Low molecular weight proteins were isolated from human female reproductive tract tissues obtained from premenopausal women. Antimicrobial activity of these LMW proteins was assessed against different reproductive tract pathogens viz., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Group B streptococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherechia coli and Candida albicans. The expression of these peptides were also documented in reproductive tract tissues with the help of hyperimmune sera raised against the rabbits. The purified peptide was characterized by N-terminal sequencing. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that 2 kDa peptide was expressed in the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix while it was absent in columnar epithelial cells of upper genital tract. Upregulation of the expression of this peptide was observed in patients of chronic non-specific cervicitis and acute on chronic cervicitis. This purified antimicrobial peptide also showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against different reproductive tract pathogens. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Considering the emerging bacterial resistance against conventional antibiotics, isolation and understanding of the expression of antimicrobial peptides from female reproductive tissue extracts may provide some leads towards the development of strategies for the treatment of reproductive tract infections.
TI  - [The role of infection in preterm birth].
AB  - Intrauterine infection could be responsible for 25% up to 40% of preterm births.  This relationship was initially demonstrated using animal models, inducing their abortion by injecting bacteria or endotoxins. In human research, examination of amniocentesis fluid showed the anteriority of infection over labor induction, and the existence of a subclinical latency phase between these two phenomena. The ascending route is preponderant, and four stages can be distinguished: cervical and vaginal infection, chorio-decidual infection, intra-amniotic infection, fetal infection. The intrauterine infection is very frequent in case of early preterm birth (<30 WG). It is associated with an increase of neurological and pulmonary morbidity. Most commonly found bacterial species are mycoplasma species, but also Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus B. Several markers of the infection have been studied: a maternal leukocytosis>15,000/mm(3) or a C-Reactive Protein (CRP)>20mg/l, an increase of fibronectin and/or IL-6 cervical, a short cervical length especially before 32 WG, a leukocytosis of the amniotic fluid, and/or high interleukin concentrations. The main marker used for the newborn is the CRP, but other markers can also be used for an early diagnosis of an infection, especially interleukin 6.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.
TI  - The prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex PCR-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in Sydney, Australia.
AB  - This study used a previously described multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. First-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in Sydney, Australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. One hundred and sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly G. vaginalis and Ureaplasma spp. The prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. Of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. Only G. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (P = 0.05). The specificity of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. The mean sensitivities of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. There were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis and H. influenzae, although all were found infrequently. Overall, the mPCR/RLB platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.
TI  - Inerolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by Lactobacillus iners.
AB  - Lactobacillus iners is a common constituent of the human vaginal microbiota. This species was only recently characterized due to its fastidious growth requirements and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. Here we present the identification and molecular characterization of a protein toxin produced by L. iners. The L. iners genome encodes an open reading frame with significant primary sequence similarity to intermedilysin (ILY; 69.2% similarity) and vaginolysin (VLY; 68.4% similarity), the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Streptococcus intermedius and Gardnerella vaginalis, respectively. Clinical isolates of L. iners produce this protein, inerolysin (INY), during growth in vitro, as assessed by Western analysis. INY is a pore-forming toxin that is activated by reducing agents and inhibited by excess cholesterol. It is active across a pH range of 4.5 to 6.0 but is inactive at pH 7.4. At sublytic concentrations, INY activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and allows entry of fluorescent phalloidin into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Unlike VLY and ILY, which are human specific, INY is active against cells from a broad range of species. INY represents a new target for studies directed at understanding the role of L. iners in states of health and disease at the vaginal mucosal surface.
TI  - Detection of sexually transmitted infection and human papillomavirus in negative  cytology by multiplex-PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 15 species that cause sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in negative cytology. In addition, we compared the diagnostic performance of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with widely available techniques used to detect HPV. METHODS: We recruited 235 women of reproductive age who had negative cytology findings in a liquid-based cervical smear. STIs were identified by multiplex PCR, and HPV genotypes by multiplex PCR, hybrid capture 2, and DNA microaray; discordant results were analyzed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Approximately 96.6% of patients with negative cytology results were positive for pathogens that cause STIs. The pathogens most frequently detected were Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The incidence of HPV in negative cytology was 23.3%. Low-risk HPV infection was significantly correlated with Chalmaydia trachomatis, and high-risk HPV infection was significantly correlated with Group beta streptococcus. The analytical sensitivities of the multiplex PCR and DNA microarray were higher than 80%, and the analytical specificity was nearly 100% for all tests. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR yielded results that most of patients with negative cytology were positive for pathogens that cause STIs, and were more similar to that of DNA microarray, than that of hybrid capture 2 in terms of analytical sensitivity and prediction value of HPV infection.
TI  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. The activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. An overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of CDCs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. The way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. Their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. In this chapter I aim to provide an overview of our understanding of the interaction between CDCs and other members of what is now called the MACPF/CDC superfamily, with their target membranes. CDCs (also in the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four Gram-positive bacterial genera (Clostridium, Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus). Well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. Listeriolysin from L. monocytogenes is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. Perfringolysin from C. perfringens (Fig. 1A) has become perhaps the most studied CDC4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). Streptolysin from S. pyogenes is another intensely studied CDC and has been applied widely in experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. Pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for S. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. However, CDCs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone Metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. The homology with the MACPF family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic MACPF/CDC fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (Fig. 1A and D). Without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. The glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that CDCs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. While not all MACPF domains are involved in pore formation-for example, C6 and C8beta--they are all apparently involved in action on membranes. The dramatic refolding undergone by CDCs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the MACPF/CDC domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (Fig. 1A-C). It is obviously the basic assumption that where nonCDC members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 Even where a member of the MACPF/CDC superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. However, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another MACPF/CDC family member or members from the same specific system. Complement acts by a combination of the C5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting C9 to form a lesion, which may be a complete ring of C9 associated with the C5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.Perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). Incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.
TI  - Efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevention. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty healthy Chinese women with a history of recurrent BV were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (Probaclac Vaginal; Nicar Laboratories, Inc, Blainville, Quebec, Canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days on. RESULTS: Probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for BV (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; P < .001) and Gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; P = .02). Between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of BV and G vaginalis. Aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces BV recurrence and G vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.
TI  - Gardnerella, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. The data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyiticum and Chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. In the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are Gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), Candida species (12.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). The genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), Enterobacteriaceae or Enterococci (12.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). The reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. Our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for Streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci, Streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.
TI  - [Evaluation of microbiological diagnostics in urogenital infections in postmenopausal women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the percentage of infections in postmenopausal women with urinary symptoms which can be confirmed by microbiological analysis, the most common causative agents and whether the urethra and vagina in patients with cystitis are concurrently colonized by pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Laboratories of the Croatian National Institute of Public Health in Zagreb, in the period of two years, analyzed 245 samples taken from patients with urinary symptoms who had been postmenopausal at least for a year. Urine samples, as well as urethral and vaginal swabs were taken from each patient and tested for causative agents of urogenital infections, genital mycoplasma and Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: Cystitis was confirmed by microbiological analysis in 31.4% women, urethritis in 24.8%, and vaginitis in 15.1%. The most common causative agent of urethritis was Ureaplasma urealyticum, while Gardnerella vaginalis was the most common in vaginal infections. E. coli was concurrently isolated in urine, urethral and vaginal samples in 65.1% of patients with E. coli cystitis, while Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in urethral and vaginal samples in each patient with Streptococcus agalactiae cystitis. CONCLUSION: Mucosal colonization of the urethra and vagina contributes to the incidence of cystitis in postmenopausal women. Microbiological diagnostics is necessary to distinguish between the symptoms of ageing of the urogenital system and infection, with a view to preventing unnecessary antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and HSV2, N. meningitidis, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. The method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. The limits of detection for the mPCR/RLB assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic DNA. There were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. This method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with and without urethritis attending two Sydney sexual health clinics. One or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. Of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mPCR/RLB and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific PCR), 9 were positive only by mPCR/RLB, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. The mPCR/RLB method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.
TI  - Evaluation of common organisms causing vaginal discharge.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal discharge is very common problem among females. Alteration in balance of normal vaginal organisms can cause the overgrowth of the bacteria that creates vaginal discharge. It is common among sexually active women yet there still remain gaps in our knowledge of this infectious disorder. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis (VC), vaginal trichomoniasis and Group B streptococcus in women complaining of vaginal discharge in our setup. METHOD: A total of 100 women of reproductive age group with the complaint of vaginal discharge were included in the study. After filling proforma patients were examined by speculum examination and two high vaginal swabs (HVS) were collected aseptically from each patient. One swab was used for making wet mount for clue cells, pus cells and for motility of Trichomonas vaginalis. The other swab was used to check pH and Amine test. The growth was confirmed by Gram staining in each case. RESULTS: Gardnerrella vaginalis were isolated in 28%, Group B streptococcus in 5% and T. vaginolis in 4% of women. CONCLUSION: Gardnerella vaginalis causing BV is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age group in our setup.
TI  - Utility of reflexive semen cultures for detecting bacterial infections in patients with infertility and leukocytospermia.
AB  - This study evaluated the benefit of reflexive semen cultures in peroxidase-positive samples drawn from 17,142 consecutive samples analyzed, in which 4.7% (807/17,142) had leukocytospermia and 12.7% of those (103/807) grew significant bacterial colonies on culture. Considering the potential ramifications of the use of samples with bacteriospermia, we conclude that reflexive culture results are cost-effective and prudent.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Functional and phylogenetic characterization of Vaginolysin, the human-specific cytolysin from Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Pore-forming toxins are essential to the virulence of a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis is a bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and its significant adverse sequelae, including preterm birth and acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. G. vaginalis makes a protein toxin that generates host immune responses and has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of BV. We demonstrate that G. vaginalis produces a toxin (vaginolysin [VLY]) that is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family, most closely related to intermedilysin from Streptococcus intermedius. Consistent with this predicted relationship, VLY lyses target cells in a species-specific manner, dependent upon the complement regulatory molecule CD59. In addition to causing erythrocyte lysis, VLY activates the conserved epithelial p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and induces interleukin-8 production by human epithelial cells. Transfection of human CD59 into nonsusceptible cells renders them sensitive to VLY-mediated lysis. In addition, a single amino acid substitution in the VLY undecapeptide [VLY(P480W)] generates a toxoid that does not form pores, and introduction of the analogous proline residue into another CDC, pneumolysin, significantly decreases its cytolytic activity. Further investigation of the mechanism of action of VLY may improve understanding of the functions of the CDC family as well as diagnosis and therapy for BV.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Isolation of the Bacillus subtilis antimicrobial peptide subtilosin from the dairy product-derived Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.
AB  - AIMS: To purify and characterize an antimicrobial protein (bacteriocin) isolated  from the dairy product-derived Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. METHODS AND RESULTS: An unknown bacterial species cultured from the Yogu Farm probiotic dairy beverage was identified through 16S ribosomal RNA analysis as B. amyloliquefaciens, a phylogenetically close relative of Bacillus subtilis. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of overnight cultures was active against Listeria monocytogenes and also against clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus agalactiae. At the same time, several isolates of vaginal probiotic Lactobacilli were resistant to the CFS. The nature of the compound causing inhibitory activity was confirmed as proteinaceous by enzymatic digestion. The protein was isolated using ammonium sulfate precipitation, and further purified via column chromatography. PCR analysis was conducted to determine relatedness to other bacteriocins produced by Bacillus spp. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial protein isolated from B. amyloliquefaciens was shown to be subtilosin, a bacteriocin previously reported as produced only by B. subtilis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of intra-species horizontal gene transfer for subtilosin and the first fully characterized bacteriocin isolated from B. amyloliquefaciens. Finally, this is the first report on subtilosin's activity against bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens.
TI  - [Streptococcus group B--association with Aerobic vaginitis and ability to human cell lines activation].
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate: the frequency of aerobic vaginitis, susceptibility of the GBS isolated from vagina of non-pregnant women with and without cervicitis to selected antibiotics and chemotherapeutics and the proinflammatory cytokines production by HeLa, THP-I, U - 937 cells after stimulation by vaginal GBS. Our results indicated low frequency of the aerobic vaginitis -4.5% among non-pregnant young women and ability of the vaginal GBS to release proinflammatory cytokines by human cell lines in vitro.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  Gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. The aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from 1996 to 2006. Medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range 1-16, SD 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. SPSS software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. Sexually transmitted diseases were documented: Gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), Chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), Syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), Trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and HIV 0 (0%, 27 tested). Bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): Gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), Enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), Haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), Streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), Streptococcus Group B 8 (6.6%), Staphylococcus Koag neg. 37 (30.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), Bacteroides 19 (15.7%), Prevotella 24 (19.8%), Klebsiella 4 (3.3%), Corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and Ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. Bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms (except for Bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.
TI  - Etiologic agents of cervicovaginitis in Turkish women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of microbiologic agents causing cervicovaginitis. METHODS: We conducted the study between October 2002 and December 2004 in Abant Izzet Baysal University, Duzce School of Medicine Hospital, Turkey. The samples were obtained from the posterior vaginal fornix and cervix by swabs in 828 patients. Direct microscopic examination, culture and enzyme immune assay (EIA) methods were performed in all patients for diagnosis of microbiologic agents. RESULTS: Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) were diagnosed in 254 (30.7%) patients, Candida albicans (C. albicans) in 152 (18.4%), Candida glabrata (C. glabrata) in 36 (4.3%), Candida species in 52 (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in 62 (7.5%), Streptococcus group B in 28 (3.4%), Escherichia coli (E. coli) in 42 (5.1%), Klebsiella species in 24 (2.9%), and Streptococcus group D in 8 (1%) patients in culture. Less frequent enterobacteria in 30 (3.6%) were: Pseudomonas species, Proteus species Enterobacter species, Hafnia alvei and Nonfermenter species. Neisseria gonorrheae (N. gonorrheae) was detected in one patient (0.1%) in culture. The Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) antigen was detected by EIA methods in 130 (15.7%) patients and Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis) was observed in 8 (1%) patients by direct microscopic examination. CONCLUSION: Performing the etiologic diagnosis of cervicovaginitis is necessary in order to take appropriate therapeutic and preventive measures. Therefore, we recommend G. vaginalis, C. albicans and C. trachomatis should be investigated in patients having a diagnosis of cervicovaginitis in our population, since these were detected in a considerable number of cases. Additionally, C. glabrata and T. vaginalis should be kept in mind as possible pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  - The physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. This prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. Semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and/or U. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) CCU ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. In standard aerobic cultures, Gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and Streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). Ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered, high (> or =10(4) CCU ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) CCU ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. Of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. This study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of U. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for U. urealyticum should be raised to > or =10(4) CFU ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before any treatment.
TI  - Comparison between Gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade I microflora and revised categorization of grade I microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using Nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on Gram stained slides of vaginal smears. Ison and Hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the Streptococcus cell type. Because in the Nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard Gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the Gram stain. To this purpose we compared Gram stain based categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific PCR for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae and with ii) tDNA-PCR for the identification of most cultivable species. RESULTS: A total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade I microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade II, 22 (4.3%) as grade III and 8 (1.6%) as grade IV, according to the criteria of Ison and Hay. Another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade I-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. We found that 52.7% of the grade I-like samples contained Bifidobacterium spp. while L. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade II specimens.Based on the presence of different Lactobacillus cell types, grade I specimens were further characterized as grade Ia (40.2%), grade Iab (14.9%) and grade Ib (44.9%). We found that this classification was supported by the finding that L. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade Ia and Iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade Ib specimens, a category in which L. gasseri and L. iners were predominant. CONCLUSION: Further refinement of Gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade I smears (Ia, Iab and Ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade I-like. A strong correlation was found between grade Ia and the presence of L. crispatus and between grade I-like and the presence of bifidobacteria. This refinement of Gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.
TI  - Symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis in heterosexual men: a case control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men. METHODS: Case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Australia. Sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. First stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), Mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, PCR), Ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and PCR), and Streptococcus spp, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Haemophilus species (culture). Urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes. RESULTS: 80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002-3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had Chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had Mycoplasma genitalium (OR 6.1 (95% CI: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had Gardnerella vaginalis (OR 9.0 (95% CI: 1.6 to 52)). Other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. The presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis (OR 1.7 (95% CI: 0.5 to 5.4)). Urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (OR 9.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (OR 3.5 (95% CI: 1.0 to 13)). CONCLUSION: Gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. Microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.
TI  - [Study of acute vulvovaginitis in sexually active adult women, with special reference to candidosis, in patients of the Francisco J. Muniz Infectious Diseases Hospital].
AB  - The results of microbiological vaginal secretions samples obtained from 749 women (from July 2001 to July 2002) were studied in the Bacteriology Unit of the Francisco Javier Muniz Hospital from Buenos Aires. All patients suffered acute vulvovaginitis were child bearing and sexually active women, 334 of them were HIV-positive. The following are the results of the microbiological studies: Lactobacillus spp 50.6%, Gardnerella vaginalis 25.6%, Candida spp 17.4%, Trichomonas vaginalis 5.3%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.3% and B group Streptococcus 0.8%. Candida vaginitis was significantly more frequent in HIV-positive patients, (21.6% vs 14%; p = 0.0086); meanwhile, trichomoniasis was less common although the difference was not statistically significant (3.6 vs 6.7%, p = 0.0810). The following Candida species were isolated in this study: Candida albicans 76.8%, Candida glabrata 15.6%, Candida parapsilosis 2.9%, Candida tropicalis 1.5% and Candida krusei 0.7%. Eight cases (6.2%) of vaginitis were produced by two Candida species (C. albicans and C. glabrata), and in three cases (2.17%) Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated. Five women suffering acute vaginitis with Candida spp presented another etiologic agent of vaginal infection, three cases T. vaginalis and two cases G. vaginalis. The following are some of the most important findings of this study: 1) Half of the patients presented a normal microbial biota; 2) Candida spp vaginitis was significantly more frequent among HIV-positive women; 3) we observed a high incidence of Candida glabrata infections (15.9%), 4) 6.2% of vaginal candidiasis were caused by more than one Candida species and, 5) the susceptibility pattern of C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates against fluconazole was similar to the one observed in other studies. The majority of C. albicans isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (MIC90 = 0.5 microg/ml) meanwhile C. glabrata strains were much less susceptible to this drug (MIC50 and MIC90 = 32 microg/ml).
TI  - [Clinical relevance of antibiotic resistance in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Antibiotic resistance of microorganisms that cause infections of the urogenital tract is a clinically relevant problem in obstetrics and gynecology. Due to methodological difficulties, resistance testing is rarely used for the management of these infections. Therefore, solid epidemiological data on resistance rates of most involved pathogens are scarce. Antibiotic resistance of several microorganisms appears to be increasing in various areas of the world, mainly Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis (metronidazole),Streptococcus agalactiae (macrolides, clindamycin), Mycoplasma hominis (tetracyclines, intrinsically macrolide resistant). In addition,isolated cases of clinical infections caused by multi-resistant Chlamydia trachomatis have been reported. The presence of antibiotic resistance should therefore be considered in patients with an unfavorable course despite adequate antibiotic therapy. In light of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the large gaps in our knowledge in this particular area, research efforts in the field of anti-biotic resistance in gynecological infections should be markedly intensified.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - [Abnormal bacterial colonisation of the vagina and implantation during assisted reproduction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of our treatment of vaginal infection for couples included in an IVF program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microbiologic screening of vaginal flora and semen has been performed one month prior to in vitro fertilization for 951 couples in 2000. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in case of positive culture. RESULTS: Positive microbial growths were observed from endocervical and vaginal cultures in 218 women (22.9%). The clinical pregnancy rate was 30.29% in the group of patients without growth and 30.27% in the group with positive microbial growth. The implantation rate was significantly diminished in case of bacterial growth: 14.6 compared to 19.3% (P <0.02) for sterile endocervical culture. Five main bacterial species were found at the cervical level: Candida albicans (69 cases), Ureaplasma urealyticum (49 cases), Gardnerella vaginalis (43 cases), Streptococcus B or D (24 cases) and Escherichia coli (22 cases). Positive cultures from both vagina and semen were observed for 77 couples whose clinical pregnancy rate was 19.5 vs 36.2% in case of vaginal infection alone (P <0.01) with a spontaneous miscarriage rate of 46.7 compared to 17.6% (P <0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Endocervical microorganisms, even treated with adapted antibiotics, may affect embryonic implantation. Positive culture from both female and male partner may enhance this negative effect. In this case, the best strategy would be to cancel the IVF treatment.
TI  - [Microbiological findings in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in  the Hradec Kralove Faculty Hospital 1995-2002].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the microbiological findings in the patients with the recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) with a focus on the establishment of fungal etiology and its in vitro antifungal susceptibility. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical and laboratory study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical Faculty Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Prague, Department of Clinical Microbiology, Medical Faculty Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Prague, Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Prague. METHODS: An analysis of clinical and anamnestic data in outpatients of the Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the laboratory data from the microbiological examinations performed in the Dept. of Clinical Microbiology from 1995 to 2002. RESULTS: Candida albicans accounted for 88.5% of the episodes of RVVC in the setting of 56 patients. Non-albicans Candida species were represented especially by C. glabrata (4.9%) and C. krusei (3.1%). There were no considerable differences between the spectrum of RVVC and acute vulvovaginal candidiasis with the exception of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.7% in RVVC vs. 3.7% in acute VVC). Mycological findings in 61 (20.5%) samples were accompanied by bacterial microbiota with the predominance of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 15) and Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 9). Decreased antifungal susceptibility determined by the disk test was observed in the strains of C. glabrata, C. krusei and S. cerevisiae, the other yeast isolates being susceptible to all ten antifungal drugs tested. CONCLUSION: The microbiological examination was decisive for the establishment of the diagnosis of RVVC in most cases. The most frequent etiological agents responsible for the attacks of RVVC as well as for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis was C. albicans, which was generally susceptible to antifungal drugs.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
TI  - Increased risk of cervical canal infections with intracervical Foley catheter.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intracervical Foley catheter insertion, for  the induction of labor, on cervical canal infection. DESIGN: A prospective interventional study with paired analysis. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Aga Khan University, Karachi, between June 1 and August 31, 2002. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In 45 women undergoing cervical ripening with intracervical Foley catheter for the induction of labour at term, cervical swabs were taken for culture and sensitivity before its insertion and again after its spontaneous expulsion or removal. RESULTS: Intracervical Foley catheter was retained for mean duration of 8.1 +/- 1.7 hours. There was a significant change in the pathogenic organisms (0 % v 16.3 %; p 0.016) from pre-Foley to post-Foley catheter cervical swab cultures. Growth of beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group-B, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Gardnerella vaginalis on cervical swab were considered pathogenic. One woman (2.2 %) developed fever following insertion of intracervical Foley catheter. No statistically significant effect of potential confounding factors was observed on change in growth of pathogenic organisms. CONCLUSION: Induction of labour at term with Foley catheter is associated with a significant increase in intracervical pathogenic organisms despite undertaking routine aseptic measures. We recommend evaluation of this technique for its potential infectious harm in larger studies. Meanwhile, extreme aseptic measures should be undertaken during its insertion to avoid maternal and possible neonatal infections.
TI  - [Role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. The participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of UTI; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. To gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in UTI. METHODS: A total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low UTI were analyzed. Samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and McConkey agar, as well as HBT medium for G. vaginalis, and U9B broth and agar E broth for M. hominis and U. urealyticum. The following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. RESULTS. There were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): G. vaginalis (25.7%), U. urealyticum (5.9%), S. agalactiae (3.4%) and M. hominis (2%). UTI were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of UTI.
TI  - [Retrospective microbiologic evaluation of vaginal cultures].
AB  - Vaginal culture is one of the most difficult cultures to be evaluated in clinical microbiology practice. The necessity of some expensive and complicated processes for diagnosis of some specific agents, age related variability of normal vaginal flora and failure caused by temporary presence of some pathogens in normal flora can be listed among the probable causes of that problem. In this study 8050 vaginal cultures performed in our hospital laboratories between 1 March 1999-15 September 2001 were evaluated retrospectively. It was shown that the most frequently isolated pathogens were yeasts belonging to the Candida genus (26.8%). The second most frequent pathogen (13.8%) was Gardnerella vaginalis which was an indicator of bacterial vaginosis. The rate of isolation of Trichomonas vaginalis was 2.2%. Group B streptococcus (GBS) was isolated in 2.0% of the total cultures. Some nonspecific bacteria, mainly Gram negative bacilli, were noted as colonizing agents (6.5%).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dequalinium chloride against leading germs of vaginal infections.
AB  - Dequalinium chloride (CAS 522-51-0) and povidone iodine (CAS 25655-41-8) are known as antiseptic agents and used in the local treatment of vaginal infections. Clotrimazole (CAS 23593-75-1) is an anti-fungal drug and applied primarily in the therapy of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and to a lesser extent in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. However, antimicrobial activities of those three agents in comparison to each other have not been reported so far. To address this issue the antimicrobial activities of these agents against 18 germs relevant to vaginal infections were determined. The tested species are representatives of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Listeria, Escherichia, Proteus, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Candida, and Trichomonas. All micro-organisms were susceptible to dequalinium chloride with the exception of Proteus mirabilis. At a given dose, the activity of dequalinium chloride was higher as compared to the other substances. In view of its wide antimicrobial spectrum dequalinium chloride is an efficient alternative in the local therapy of vaginal infections such as fluor vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis, vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.
TI  - Anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including Gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal G. vaginalis in both genders. From a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. Inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. Several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. At least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. Most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). S. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and Haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. G. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - [Cervicovaginal infection as a risk factor for premature labor].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible association between cervicovaginal infections (CVI) and preterm delivery. DESIGN: Cohorts. REFERENCE FRAME: Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Hospital Central Militar and Hospital General Regional No. 1, IMSS, Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. PATIENTS: Four hundred and sixty eight patients attending prenatal control and delivery care. INTERVENTIONS: Fresh smears, Gram stain, and cervicovaginal sample culture from samples obtained during the following gestational stages: First sample at 16-24 weeks, second sample at 25-32 weeks, and third sample at 33-42 weeks. The following microorganisms were studied: Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. In case of a positive culture, the specific treatment was indicated. MEASUREMENTS: Positive or negative culture for each of the studied pathogens, and the presence or absence of a preterm delivery for each of the patients included in the study. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety eight were still present at the end of the study, of which 156 had a CVI and 242 had no CVI. No differences between both groups were observed concerning preterm delivery. Significant relative risks were: In the first stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis with RR = 9.0 (6.81, 11.8); in the second stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 6.2 (3.30, 11.7) and Escherichia coli with RR = 3.4 (1.33, 8.6); in the third stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 9.19 (6.93, 12.1). The logistic regression analysis identified Ureaplasma urealyticum during the second stage with OR = 16.6 (2.9, 93.7), statistically significant with p = 0.001. The survival analysis showed differences between the two groups concerning pregnancy duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in the duration in pregnancy in patients with CVI and without CVI. Ureaplasma urealyticum is consistently associated with preterm delivery.
TI  - Definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. SAMPLE: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. METHODS: Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). RESULTS: Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. CONCLUSION: Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - [The treatment of bacterial vaginosis with Dalacin V cream].
AB  - To asses the efficiency of the 2% clindamycin phosphate creme given in 3 and 7 daily courses officially designer for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: The study includes 65 patients who have microbiological data for BV 11 of the women are pregnant (18.46%). The microbiological study includes there agent: Streptococcus agalactiae, E. colli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, Staphylococcus epidermidis et Enterococcus fecalis. The controls visit was assessed on the 7'] and 28'] day after the therapy. RESULTS: There were successful results on the 84.3% of the patients after 7 day course but in the 3-day course the good results were showed in 73.91% of the women. After the 28"] day there were only few successful results 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The clindamycin phosphate is more preferable method for the treatment of BV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates HIV-1 expression.
AB  - Alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. We recently characterized a soluble HIV-inducing factor (HIF) from the cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples of women. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on HIV-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between HIF activity and microflora. Physiologically relevant microorganisms, Mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the CVL of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing HIF activity, induced HIV-1 expression. The magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and Mycoplasma. The transcriptional induction by Mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the KB enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with HIF. Also as with HIF, Mycoplasma induced AP-1 dependent transcription. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based speciation showed that the isolate was M. hominis. Our data indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance HIV-1 transcription and replication and identify M. hominis as a potential source for HIF activity. The virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and HIF may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to HIV transmission.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Assessment of office-based care of sexually transmitted diseases and vaginitis and antibiotic decision-making by obstetrician-gynecologists.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Survey office-based obstetric-gynecologic practitioners regarding their knowledge of infectious disease care and antibiotic use. METHODS: A survey questionnaire of multiple-choice questions was mailed to Fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists about clinical entities for which recommendations have undergone recent changes or about which there was a lack of consensus in a prior similar survey (Gibbs RS, McGregor JA, Mead PB, et al.: Obstet Gynecol 83:631-636, 1994). RESULTS: Respondents indicated that oral metronidazole was their most frequent choice to treat bacterial vaginosis. Ampicillin (57%) was used more often than penicillin (39%) for intrapartum group B streptococcus prophylaxis. Azithromycin was preferred (61%) over erythromycin-base (38%) for chlamydia treatment during pregnancy. There were several modes of practice that deviated from accepted care: 27% and 29% did not screen for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively, in pregnancy; 17% used cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis to diagnose bacterial vaginosis; 25% considered quinolones to be safe in pregnancy; 93% felt metronidazole should never be used in pregnancy; and the majority (66%) would send a patient treated successfully for pelvic cellulitis home with an oral antibiotic. CONCLUSION: Respondents' infectious disease knowledge and practices in obstetrics and gynecology is appropriate in treating sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial vaginosis, and group B streptococcus. Numerous deficiencies still exist in screening for sexually transmitted diseases in pregnancy and diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, as well as in the choice of antibiotics to use or avoid for certain infections.
TI  - Relationship between maternal group B streptococcal colonization and pregnancy outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) with preterm labor and premature rupture of the membranes (PROM). METHODS: Vaginal cultures were conducted in 615 women at 22-26 weeks' gestation and again on admission for term delivery, preterm labor, or PROM. Antibiotics were not given antenatally based on a GBS-positive culture result. Fisher exact test and maximum likelihood analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The rates of preterm labor and PROM were not significantly different between GBS-positive and GBS-negative women in both the antenatal screening and the screening on admission. According to maximum-likelihood analyses, the known risk factors for preterm labor and PROM collectively were important risk factors for preterm labor (odds ratio: 6.48), but GBS colonization during pregnancy was not a risk factor for preterm labor or PROM. In the antenatal screening, the proportion of subjects with lactobacilli-reduced vaginal flora was significantly higher in GBS-positive women (14.3%; ten of 70) than in GBS-negative women (6.4%; 35 of 545) (P = 0.26). Bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes) were isolated in only 3.7% (23 of 615) of all subjects. CONCLUSION: Vaginal colonization with GBS was not associated with preterm labor and PROM in an obstetric population with a low incidence of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, despite the presence of lactobacilli-reduced flora in GBS-positive women.
TI  - [The role of lower genital tract infection in PROM].
AB  - The authors conducted a prospective study of the role of lower genital tract infection in PTL and PROM in high risk obstetric population with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal tract. A total amount of 62 women within 28 to 37 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. Subjects were cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacterioides fragilis, M. Hominis, U. Urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida galabrata and they were followed to delivery. Preterm rupture of membranes occurred in 30.6% of these pregnancies.
TI  - Bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. METHODS: Ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. Blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within 15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. Chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. Demographic, labor, delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. Bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (P = .02). Isolates included group B streptococcus (n = 5), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of Prevotella bivia, G vaginalis, and viridans streptococci (n = 1). Bacteremia was associated with earlier median gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. After adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. Many of the isolates are capable of causing endocarditis. Appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - Composition of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  - One hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Candida albicans. Mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. Although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the L. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. Isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the L. acidophilus complex. Data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (P-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the L. acidophilus complex. DNA-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. Most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to L. gasseri CIP 102991T by the technique of DNA/DNA hybridization.
TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae: a vaginal pathogen?
AB  - The significance of Streptococcus agalactiae as an aetiological agent in vaginitis was evaluated. A total of 6226 samples from women who presented with vaginal symptoms was examined. The presence of >10 leucocytes/high-power field (h.p.f.) was taken to be the criterion of active infection. S. agalactiae was isolated from 10.1% of these samples. The isolation rates of other common pathogens such as Candida spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas spp. were 54.1%, 27.2% and 4.2%, respectively, in the same group of patients. In contrast, the isolation rates of these micro-organisms in the group of patients who had no infection (<10 leucocytes/h.p.f.) were 4.2%, 38.3%, 33% and 0.5%, respectively. In the majority of samples from which S. agalactiae was isolated, it was the sole pathogen isolated (83%) and its presence was associated with an inflammatory response in 80% of patients. Furthermore, the relative risk of vaginal infection with S. agalactiae (2.38) in patients with purulent vaginal discharge was greater than that of Candida spp. infection (1.41) and lower than that of Trichomonas spp. infection (8.32). These data suggest that S. agalactiae in symptomatic women with microscopic evidence of inflammation should be considered a causative agent of vaginitis.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - [Frequency of isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum in an open population from southern Mexico City].
AB  - Vaginal cultures for Ureaplasma urealyticum and confidential questionnaires were  obtained from women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis who consulted a physician at a Primary Health Center, Tlalpan, D.F., Mexico. In all 220 women were studied, 50 (22.7%) of whom were colonized with Ureaplasma urealyticum, statistical analysis (X2) showed there was no association between colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum, and age, pregnancy, and other but there was association between colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum and the number of pregnancies and no birth control method use.
TI  - [The isolation of Streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  - We have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by Gynecology Service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. We achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58 (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to Streptococcus morbillorum 9 (15.5%), to Gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to Enterococcus faecalis-durans and to Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to Streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to Streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to Streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis II respectively. We previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. The bacteriological identification done by the API 20 STREP System (bioMerieux GmbH, Nutingen, Germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - Sterility of the uterine cavity.
AB  - In a prospective open study the sterility of the uterine cavity was evaluated in  99 women admitted for hysterectomy. The indications for hysterectomy were in most cases persistent irregular vaginal bleeding and fibromyomas of the uterus. Samples for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis, yeasts and viruses were taken preoperatively from the apex of the vagina and cervical os. Immediately after hysterectomy the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity for microbiological examination. Wet smears were taken from the same sites. Nearly a quarter of all the patients harbored one or more microorganisms in the uterus, mostly Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterobacter and Streptococcus agalactiae. We found that in a significant number of cases, the uterine cavity is colonized with potentially pathogenic organisms which may play a causative role in endometritis. The results indicate that inflammation of the uterine cavity should be evaluated by hysteroscopic examination before hysterectomy is undertaken in patients with persistent irregular vaginal bleeding.
TI  - [Balanitis and infectious agents. A prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the Centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the St. Louis Hospital in Paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. All underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. Sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. Two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. RESULTS: Candida albicans (CA) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. A pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus milleri, group HB5) was found without CA in 28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group D streptococci) was found without CA in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. DISCUSSION: This series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with and without balanitis (p < 0.9). The role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? The significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. The clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - [Biocenosis of the vagina and infection with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - The authors have examined 379 women for infection by Chlamydia trachomatis, performing vaginal smears and routine bacterial cultures. C. trachomatis was discovered in 33.2% of the women, most frequently accompanied by erosion of the collum, cervicitis and CIN-Ca. Women with C. trachomatis had the following levels of vaginal purity: 1-44.4%, 2-23.0%, 3 and 4-29.4%, 3.2% -leukocytes only. Leukocytes were present in significantly more women with level 1 of vaginal purity than in the control group. Additional infections (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli and Trichomonas vaginalis) were found in only a small percentage of women with C. trachomatis, just as in controls. The presence of leukocytes or level 1 of vaginal hygiene with leukocytes may favour C. trachomatis, just as in controls. The presence of leukocytes or level 1 of vaginal hygiene with leukocytes may favour C. trachomatis infection, therefore these cases should be subjected to a more thorough examination.
TI  - Internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  - Twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (Two cases stage O; four cases  stage Ia; five cases stage Ib; one case stage IIa; ten cases stage IIb; two cases stage IIIa; one case stage IVa) served as the subjects. The bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. There was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. The average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. The predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis, and Prevotella bivia. As the stages of cervical cancer progressed, G. vaginalis, B. distasonis and P. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between G. vaginalis, B. distasonis and P. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.
TI  - [Vaginitis and vaginosis. Comparison of two periods].
AB  - Vaginitis is the most frequent gynecological disease. It is characterized by objective and subjective signs of inflammation and differs from bacterial vaginosis (BV) which is an abnormal condition of the vaginal ecosystem caused by the excessive growth of aerobic and anaerobic flora normally present in the vagina with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The authors report the results of a study carried out at the Centre for Gynecological Infections at the Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Parma. 828 patients were enrolled in the study during the period 1985-86 and 1559 patients during the two-year period 1991-92. The aim of the study was to evaluate variations in epidemiological data for vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis in the two periods examined. No significant changes were observed (p > 0.05) with regard to the prevalence of Ca, Tv and BV forms. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the forms sustained by other microorganisms (above all, streptococcus and enterobacteria) between the first and second periods with a parallel increase in the number of negative cases. The analysis of the age distribution of vaginitis and BV showed a reduction of other microorganisms and an increase in negative vaginal swabs in adults (> 20 years old).
TI  - Prevalence of cervical pathogens in women with and without inflammatory changes on smear testing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess correlation between nonspecific cervicitis, inflammation, or exudate on cervical smears tests and confirmed presence of known cervical pathogens. DESIGN: Investigation of women attending a family practice clinic for smear test by microbiological screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, group B streptococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. SETTING: Family practice teaching clinic in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 411 women presenting for a smear test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of genital infections associated with presence or absence of inflammatory changes on cervical smear. RESULTS: Of the 132 women with inflammatory changes on cervical smear, 64 (48%) had positive cultures. Of the 248 without inflammatory changes, 117 (47%) had positive cultures. Subgroup analysis on individual organisms also showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Reports of inflammatory changes on cervical smear testing are a poor indicator of infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  - The study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. Most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were Gram-negative--27%, mainly E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and Lactobacillus in 53% of cases. Other anaerobic bacteria were: Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), Streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14.1%). Gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). All strains of G. vaginalis were susceptible to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.
TI  - A collaborative study of the in-vitro sensitivity to RP 59500 of bacteria isolated in seven hospitals in France.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500 was determined against 1051 recent clinical bacterial isolates. The susceptibility to RP 59500 was determined with an agar dilution technique for all the isolates, while MICs and MBCs were determined for 82 selected strains in broth. Isolates of both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci appeared to be potentially susceptible to RP 59500, independent of susceptibility to methicillin or MLS resistance. (S. aureus: methicillin-sensitive, MIC90, 1.0 mg/L; methicillin-resistant, MIC90 1.0 mg/L; coagulase-negative staphylococci: methicillin-sensitive, MIC90 0.5 mg/L). Lancefield group A, B, C and G streptococci (MIC50 0.5 and MIC90 1.0 mg/L) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 0.5 and MIC90 1.0 mg/L) appeared to be susceptible to RP 59500. Some Streptococcus spp. and enterococci as well as Listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by a higher concentration of RP 59500 (enterococci: MIC90 4 mg/L, range 0.125-16 mg/L). Comparatively low MICs were seen when Legionella spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Gardnerella vaginalis were tested. Broth dilution MIC/MBC determinations showed no evidence of tolerance, as MIC values were within two dilutions of MBC values. RP 59500 might be a useful compound in the treatment of infections caused by a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to methicillin and/or macrolides.
TI  - A microbiological study of vaginal discharge in women attending a Malaysian gynaecological clinic.
AB  - Vaginal discharge is a common complaint of women attending gynaecological clinics. The purpose of this study was to compare the occurrence of commonly implicated microorganisms in vaginal discharge amongst women with or without the complaint, attending a gynaecological and family planning clinic. The association of Gardnerella vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis was also studied. It was found that there were no significant differences between the cases and controls in the isolation rate of Gardnerella vaginalis, Torulopsis glabrata, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma ssp and Group B streptococcus (p greater than 0.05). Only the isolation rate of Candida albicans was significantly higher in the cases than controls (p less than 0.01). However, there was a significant association of G. vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Pelvic inflammatory disease: guidelines for prevention and management.
AB  - This report provides comprehensive guidelines to aid practitioners and decision makers in achieving PID prevention and management objectives. The main focus of this document is PID related to STD. These guidelines for the prevention and management of PID were established by staff of CDC in consultation with a group of outside experts. Current data regarding the efficacy of prevention strategies and management approaches form the basis for the guidelines. Because data are incomplete, however, certain aspects of these guidelines represent the current consensus judgment of the consulted experts. Recommendations in this document should be considered a source of guidance to health practitioners.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in Toulouse, France.
AB  - On hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in Toulouse, France, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. The following incidences were found: Neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); Chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); Ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); Gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); Streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); Candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and Trichomonas vaginalis: 4 (1.8%). The prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. No pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). Mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). Another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation to clinical findings. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (P less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (PMN/HPF) (P less than .001). G. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (P less than .05) and in men with less than five PMN/HPF (P less than .05). Isolation of C. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (P less than .05) and balanitis (P less than .001). Like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. In contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates in the management of urethritis in men.
TI  - Prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  - Media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. The bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. A similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. In all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. It is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.
TI  - Phospholipase C activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Phospholipase C (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the  hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride. Bacterial production of phospholipase C may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase C activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract. Multiple aerobic (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase C activity. Phospholipase C-producing isolates included strains of Bacteroides fragilis, B. bivius, B. thetaiotaomicron, Gardnerella vaginalis, and group B streptococcus. Phospholipase C activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity. Phospholipase C production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in some instances of preterm birth.
TI  - Evaluation of the Gram stain as a screening tool for maternal carriage of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci. The Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study Group.
AB  - To determine the usefulness of the vaginal Gram stain as a screen for maternal group B streptococcal carriage, we compared the presence of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain with a cervicovaginal culture in 7755 women at 23-26 weeks' gestation and in 1452 women at delivery. Group B streptococci were isolated from 18.4% of women at 23-26 weeks and 14.9% of women at delivery. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Gram stain were 28, 69, 17, and 81%, respectively, in mid-gestation and 34, 72, 18, and 86%, respectively, at delivery. The presence of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain was strongly associated with the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis and with the presence of bacterial vaginosis. We conclude that most gram-positive cocci seen on Gram stain are probably anaerobes or micrococci and that the vaginal Gram stain is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be of use as a tool in the diagnosis of maternal group B streptococcal carriage.
TI  - Is candidiasis the true cause of vulvovaginal irritation in women with diabetes mellitus?
AB  - Vulvovaginitis is common in diabetic women and is often treated with antifungal agents on the assumption that the causative organism is Candida albicans. In a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. In a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. The organisms cultured were: Candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus milleri (n = 1), Streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). Where a bacterial organism was isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. It is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.
TI  - Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from the reproductive tract of four mares.
AB  - A gram-variable pleomorphic bacillus was isolated from the reproductive tracts of 4 mares during routine prebreeding soundness examinations. Using a commercial bacterial identification system, these organisms were identified as Streptococcus acidominimus. However, colonial and Gram-staining characteristics did not support this identification. Subsequent testing indicated the organism was similar to Gardnerella vaginalis. Additional growth and biochemical analysis performed in our laboratory and at the Michigan Department of Public Health and by the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, confirmed the identification of G. vaginalis.
TI  - Genital infections in women attending a genito-urinary clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe.
AB  - One hundred women attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Harare were examined for presenting features and genital infections. The most common presenting symptoms were of discharge, lower abdominal pain and dysuria, and on examination signs of discharge, inflammation, haemorrhage or ulcers/erosions were noticeable in all women. Fourteen women had genital warts. Pathogens were detected in 95% of patients. Gonococcal infection occurred in 19 women, with 60% of the strains isolated being penicillinase producing. Yeasts were detected in specimens from 25 women while chlamydial infection appeared to be rare, evidence of infection being detected in only eight women. Sera from 44 women were positive by the RPR test and sera from 33 women were positive by TPHA. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from 48 women, Group B streptococci from 37 women, and Trichomonas vaginalis from 32 women.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.
TI  - In-vitro studies with ramoplanin (MDL 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of Actinoplanes sp. (ATCC 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and D-mannose. The in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. Ramoplanin was very active against Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. Concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. Ramoplanin was also very active against Streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, Str. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. (including Cory. jeikeium), Listeria monocytogenes, Gardnerella vaginalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. In general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. With the exception of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - A new look at the diagnosis of infection of the urinary tract and its adjacent structures.
AB  - The criterion enunciated by Kass for interpreting the quantitative examination of urine is critically reappraised. The role of organisms other than those of the aerobic bowel flora, especially fastidious organisms, in urinary tract infections is discussed in detail. Clinical microbiologists are urged to pay more attention to the bacteriological examination of urine and to play a greater part in the diagnosis and treatment of infections of the urinary tract and its adjacent structures.
TI  - The value of routine cervical cultures before transcervical chorionic villus sampling.
AB  - In 226 women requesting chorionic villus sampling (CVS), routine cervical cultures were obtained before the procedure. Transcervical CVS was performed irrespective of the test results. The prevalence of potential pathogens in cervical cultures at our institution is low. Beta haemolytic Streptococcus was cultured in 3 per cent of the women. No pathogenic microorganisms were isolated in 64 per cent of the women. There was no relationship between culture results and the outcome of pregnancy. These observations suggest that adequate antiseptic cleansing of the genital tract is a suitable approach and there is no need to routinely perform cultures before CVS.
TI  - Vaginitis and pregnancy.
AB  - Vaginitis in pregnant women can affect the outcome of the pregnancy through preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection and postpartum endometritis. Women can be screened for group B streptococci, and infection in the newborn can be prevented by the institution of antibiotic therapy in labor. Screening pregnant women for bacterial vaginitis can reduce the risk of premature rupture of the membranes, premature labor and neonatal infection.
TI  - Association of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis with intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. The John Hopkins Study of Cervicitis and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome.
AB  - The authors conducted a prospective study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight less than a standard (race- and sex-adjusted) 10th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) in a high-risk, inner-city, obstetric population, with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal genital tract. A total of 801 women within 22 to 30 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. Subjects were cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Candida albicans, and they were followed to delivery. Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery occurred in 8% and 13% of these pregnancies, respectively. After adjustment for other important risk factors, colonization with C. trachomatis was significantly associated both with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 2.4, 90% confidence interval 1.32-4.18) and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 1.6, 90% confidence interval 1.01-2.50). Colonization with C. albicans was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 1.9, 90% confidence interval 1.20-3.14); colonization with M. hominis was significantly associated with preterm birth (odds ratio = 2.0, 90% confidence interval 1.42-2.93). These associations support the probable role of infection in preterm and intrauterine growth retardation births and suggest the need for carefully designed intervention studies.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia from pulmonary abscess in a male alcohol abuser.
AB  - A case of Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia is reported. This bacteremia occurred  in a male alcohol abuser who developed definite signs of pulmonary abscess and empyema. Streptococcus milleri grew from another blood culture, but Gardnerella vaginalis was also isolated from a bronchoscopic aspirate and pleural drainage sample as part of mixed flora containing anaerobes, Streptococcus species, Neisseria sicca, and a Haemophilus sp. We discuss the possible pathogenic character of G. vaginalis outside the genital tract from a review of the literature.
TI  - [Etiology of cervicovaginal infection in pregnant and non-pregnant patients].
AB  - A prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of specific microorganisms in pregnant and nonpregnant women with cervicovaginitis attended at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, was done; Candida sp, Gardnerella vaginalis, Replasma urealitycum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Group B Streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae were investigated. Two hundred thirty four patients were studied, 105/234 (44.9%) pregnant and 129/234 (55.1%) nonpregnant women, with a mean age of 26.5 years (range 14 to 44 years). One hundred eighty one (77.5%) women had only one sexual partner. The most common microorganisms seen were Candida sp (31.6%), Gardnerella vaginalis (27.7) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (15.8%). Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis was documented in 9.8% of the population. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.7%, there was not any case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Candida sp and Ureaplasma urealyticum were founded more frequent in the pregnant women than nonpregnant women, 41.9% vs. 24.8% (p less than 0.01) and 20% vs. 12.4% (p less than 0.05) respectively. Group B Streptococci was isolated as a single agent in 4.8% in pregnant women. There were not found any pathogenic microorganisms in 29.9% of the cases, as a causal agent of symptomatic cervicovaginitis.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - A randomized study of antibiotic therapy in idiopathic preterm labor.
AB  - A randomized study was undertaken to test the effects of antibiotics as an adjunct to established methods of tocolysis. One hundred fifty patients with cervical dilation of 1 cm or more and no clinically identifiable cause for preterm labor qualified for the study. Fifty-three (35%) received 500 mg ampicillin orally every 6 hours, 50 (33%) received 500 mg erythromycin orally every 6 hours, and 47 served as controls. Antibiotics were prescribed for 10 days, and the treatment was not altered by the results of cervical cultures. Of these 150 patients, 16 (11%) had positive amniotic fluid cultures. The pregnancies with positive amniotic fluid culture were characterized by significantly less time gained after admission (2.6 versus 28.7 days) and lower birth weight (1262 versus 2470 g) than in those with negative cultures. Histologic studies of the placenta revealed chorioamnionitis in 22 (16%) of 134 patients with negative amniotic fluid cultures; these pregnancies were associated with less time gained after admission (12.5 versus 31.9 days) and lower birth weight (1680 versus 2618 g) compared with pregnancies without histologic chorioamnionitis. In patients with similar gestational age and cervical dilation, the adjunctive use of antibiotic therapy resulted in a statistically significant delay from admission to delivery (30 versus 17 days). In cases of negative amniotic fluid cultures, cervical colonization with group B streptococcus and/or Gardnerella vaginalis increased the risk of prematurity, which improved significantly when ampicillin was given.
TI  - Preterm labor: the role of amnionitis.
AB  - This prospective study represents an attempt to find a link between subclinical intra-amniotic infection and preterm singleton labor in 27 asymptomatic patients with intact membranes. Liquor amnii was obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and cultured for anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas. None of these cultures was positive. The value of gas-liquid chromatographic determination of volatile and non-volatile acids in liquor amnii could not be determined because amniotic infections did not occur in the population under study.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
TI  - Transmission rate of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, B-streptococci, Candida spp. and Chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn.
AB  - In a preliminary study of the transmission rate of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma species, Gardnerella vaginalis, B-Streptococci, Candida species and Chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn, swabs were taken from 45 parturients and their neonates and cultured by suitable methods. Out of 30 parturients with a positive culture, 8 harboured more than one microorganism investigated. U. urealyticum was found in 11 newborn and all of them had a positive mother. Candida spp. were found in 4 newborn, but 3 of these had a negative mother. G. vaginalis was detected in only 1 infant and the mother was negative. C. trachomatis was not isolated from any mother but was present in 2 newborn infants. Thus only U. urealyticum showed clear evidence of transmission from mother to baby.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance and tetM in pathogenic urogenital bacteria.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. were screened for resistance to tetracycline and for the presence of the streptococcal tetM determinant. The S. agalactiae and G. vaginalis strains contained DNA sequences homologous to the tetM determinant, while strains of the other two genera did not.
TI  - High-level tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is result of acquisition of streptococcal tetM determinant.
AB  - Recently, strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). This resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetM, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus Streptococcus and more recently in Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Gardnerella vaginalis. In N. gonorrhoeae, the tetM determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. This plasmid arose from the insertion of tetM into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. The tetM determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of N. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.
TI  - Streptococci as urinary pathogens.
AB  - In a 2-month prospective study of streptococci isolated from urine specimens in the laboratory, 242 strains of catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli were isolated in substantial numbers from 11,725 specimens. These comprised 10% of the important isolates. Species identification of all isolates was undertaken. 74 (30%) of the isolates were of species other than Streptococcus faecalis and S agalactiae. 79 (33%) were not detected on cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar after overnight incubation in a carbon dioxide incubator. 20 of the 24 isolates of coccobacilli were Gardnerella vaginalis. Many of the isolates of fastidious species were accompanied by pyuria. An isolation protocol practicable in busy laboratories is proposed.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Endometrial cultures obtained by a triple-lumen method from afebrile and febrile  postpartum women.
AB  - Transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained Ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. A protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. Compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (P less than .001). Among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group B Streptococcus, enterococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery from the endometrium. Protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.
TI  - Polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  - A protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. At least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. Bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. The most common organisms included Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B Streptococcus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. Pefloxacin (MICs 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against Acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. Aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.001-0.008 mg/l). Pefloxacin (MICs 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (MICs 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. Gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-0.008 mg/l). The activity of pefloxacin (MICs 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (MICs 0.5-4 mg/l) against Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin (MICs 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. Benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. Bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (MICs 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. Whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.
TI  - Diagnosis of intrauterine infection by demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria  in the amniotic fluid.
AB  - Immunofluorescence examination of amniotic fluid for the occurrence of antibody-coated bacteria was carried out in 72 consecutive women with premature rupture of the fetal membranes to assess this method in the diagnosis of intrauterine infection. Antibody-coated bacteria were demonstrated in 11 women with clinical signs of intrauterine infection, histological amnionitis and heavy growth of one bacterial species. The presence of intrauterine infection was considered possible in another 14 women. One patient had no clinical signs of infection, but positive histological and bacteriological evidence; antibody-coated bacteria were demonstrated in this patient, but not in the remaining 13 women. In 47 women clinical, histological and bacteriological signs of intrauterine infection were absent, and examinations for antibody-coated bacteria were negative in all of them. It is concluded that the demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria in amniotic fluid indicates the presence of intrauterine infection, and the examination may in some cases be positive before the appearance of clinical signs of infection.
TI  - Vaginitis: current microbiologic and clinical concepts.
AB  - Infectious vaginitis occurs when the normal vaginal flora is disrupted; it may arise when saprophytes overwhelm the host immune response, when pathogenic organisms are introduced into the vagina or when changes in substrate allow an imbalance of microorganisms to develop. Examples of these types of vaginitis include the presence of chronic fungal infection in women with an inadequate cellular immune response to the yeast, the introduction of trichomonads into vaginal epithelium that has a sufficient supply of glycogen, and the alteration in bacterial flora, normally dominated by Lactobacillus spp., and its metabolites that is characteristic of "nonspecific vaginitis". The authors review microbiologic and clinical aspects of the fungal, protozoal and bacterial infections, including the interactions of bacteria thought to produce nonspecific vaginitis, that are now recognized as causing vaginitis. Other causes of vaginitis are also discussed.
TI  - Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for the specific detection of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms.
AB  - Glycine, one of the end products of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by a rapid, specific technique utilizing two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. A loopful of growth of each organism from its suitable agar medium was washed, suspended, and incubated with 0.1% sodium hippurate for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The supernatant of the incubated suspension from each organism was then dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. Glycine, a product of hippurate hydrolysis, was detected under UV light. This technique does not require prolonged incubation and was found to be more specific and reliable than the standard ninhydrin reaction. In addition, it is inexpensive and can be easily conducted in a clinical microbiological reference laboratory. By this method, 100% (22/22) of Campylobacter jejuni and 0% (0/9) of Campylobacter coli reference strains were positive. In addition, 100% (13/13) of group B streptococci, 100% (24/24) of group D streptococci, and 90% (18/20) of Gardenerella vaginalis clinical isolates were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. This method is useful for the identification to the species level of Campylobacter organisms and the biotyping of Gardnerella organisms and for the detection of hippurate hydrolysis by unknown microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro comparative study of RU 28965 against organisms from oral and vaginal flora.
AB  - The Authors studied the activity of RU 28965, a new macrolide antibiotic, in comparison whith erytromycin, josamycin, miocamycin, ampicillin and rifampicin against oral streptococci (45 strains), coryneform bacteria (23 strains) and G. vaginalis (15 strains). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and the effect of inoculum size on MICs were determined. RU 28965 showed better activity than the other macrolides. The MICs of RU 28965 were eightfold higher than the corresponding MICs. The MICs of RU 28965 showed up to 10 fold increase by increasing the inoculum density from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml.
TI  - Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from high vaginal swabs.
AB  - Vaginal swabs from 2715 consecutive unselected women with vaginal discharge were  examined for Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis. Of 2715 women, 2043 had non-specific vaginitis and G. vaginalis was isolated from 269 cases (13.2%). Thirty five of the strains were isolated together with C. albicans, eight with T. vaginalis, six with Bacteroides species and three each with group B Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Two hundred and sixteen (80%) of the isolates were from females between the age of 20 and 34. All 269 strains hydrolysed hippurate and fermented starch; 161 (60%) were isolated from swabs without clue cells. Although facts suggest that vaginal discharge in most of these cases had been associated with G. vaginalis, a possible aetiological role for other micro-organisms has not been ruled out. However, successful therapy with metronidazole in 80% of those cases suggests that G. vaginalis is one cause of non-specific vaginitis. The prevalence rate of G. vaginalis in 160 randomly selected women without vaginal discharge was 5%.
TI  - Microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, lactobacillus, Mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. Sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (SD = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (SD = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (P = 0.001). Sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal G. vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma species, and U. urealyticum, as well as endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea, and T. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. Significant differences in isolation rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis. In general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; N. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. Differences were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific vaginitis. Vaginal G. vaginalis and Mycoplasma species and endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. It is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.
TI  - [Prevalence of 7 microorganisms in abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis)].
AB  - Seven microorganisms (N. gonorrhoeae, C. albicans, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, U. urealyticum and Streptococcus of group B) have been assayed in genital samplings of 164 asymptomatic women (control group) and of 374 women suffering from abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis group). All these bacteria except group B Streptococci were isolated in the vaginitis group more frequently than in the control group (p less than 0.01). The proportion of negative cultures for all tested bacteria was 39% in the control group and 6.4% in the vaginitis group (p less than 0.01). This shows an association of these bacteria with 70% of the patients of the vaginitis group and with only 26% of the women of the control group (p less than 0.01). It is to be noted that the pH values are higher in the group of women with vaginitis than in the control group (p less than 0.01). Comparison of the microbial flora during "specific" an "non-specific" vaginitis indicates that G. vaginalis is isolated more frequently in patients with non-specific vaginitis than among those with specific vaginitis (p less than 0.01). Likewise, M. hominis is isolated more frequently in groups of women with either non-specific vaginitis or T. vaginalis vaginitis, than in groups of patients with a C. albicans vaginitis (p less than 0,01). The results of this study indicate that there is a causal relationship between vaginitis and the presence of T. vaginalis. C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis or N. gonorrhoeae, either as a single or a mixed infection, and that there is a relationship between increased pH values and abnormal vaginal secretions.
TI  - Evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. The analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. We retrospectively subjected 69 samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. Forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. Twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. The results obtained from chromatographic analysis are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.
TI  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. All three compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (MICs 8-32 mg/l). Staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. Streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the MICs of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). Anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. Variants of Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. The MICs of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.
TI  - Use of a sodium polyanetholesulfonate disk for the identification of Gardnerella  vaginalis.
AB  - Several methods have been previously suggested for the presumptive identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in clinical laboratories, but none is entirely satisfactory. We previously found that sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) inhibits G. vaginalis in blood culture media. We compared susceptibility to an SPS-containing paper disk with beta-hemolysis on human blood agar, hippurate hydrolysis, and inhibition by alpha-hemolytic streptococci for identification of 62 previously confirmed G. vaginalis strains. All strains were positive by SPS disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition, 78% were positive by beta-hemolysis, and 81% were positive by hippurate hydrolysis. Although positive reactions occurred with SPS disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus tests for 5 and 9 of 84 other bacteria tested, respectively, none of these bacteria were positive for both tests. We conclude that a combination of SPS disk susceptibility and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition provides excellent identification of G. vaginalis when performed by the methods suggested.
TI  - Measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  - The detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating Streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. It is also useful in identifying Eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Bacillus. Currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. Starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. A 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. The reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees C. When dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees C for 4 weeks.
TI  - Vaginitis in sexually active women: relationship to nine sexually transmitted organisms.
AB  - Women seen for symptoms suggestive of vulvovaginitis were studied for the detection of Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum, yeast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, aerobes, anaerobes, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Asymptomatic women who reported to be sexually active and agreed to undergo comprehensive genital cultures were used as controls. There was a significant association of vulvovaginitis with the recovery of sexually transmitted organisms. However, all organisms were also recovered from asymptomatic patients. A total of 468 sexually transmitted organisms were recovered from 253 symptomatic patients (1.85 organisms per patient), while 125 were recovered from 130 asymptomatic patients (0.96 organisms per patient). The difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for Chlamydia trachomatis, group B streptococcus, and the mycoplasmas was not statistically significant. Factors that predispose patients to the manifestations of symptoms are not clearly understood.
TI  - Comparison of bacterial and fungal adherence to vaginal exfoliated epithelial cells and human vaginal epithelial tissue culture cells.
AB  - The adherence of four bacterial species and Candida albicans to a new in vitro tissue culture model of human vaginal stratified squamous epithelium was investigated and compared with in vitro adherence to vaginal exfoliated cells. Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococci, Lactobacillus sp., and C. albicans adhered well to both exfoliated and tissue culture cells. Similarly, a piliated fecal isolate of Escherichia coli, but not a nonpiliated vaginal isolate of E. coli, adhered well to both cell types. Adherence of the piliated E. coli was markedly inhibited by preincubation of bacteria with D-mannose. No inhibition of adherence by D-mannose of G. vaginalis, nonpiliated E. coli, and C. albicans was demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy of tissue cultures showed nonuniform distribution of adherent microorganisms with diminished adherence in areas of active mitosis and proliferation and increased adherence to mature flat cells, often in the process of desquamation.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to vaginal epithelial cells at various times in the menstrual cycle.
AB  - Adherence of vaginal isolates of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus species, group B streptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells was studied in 10 healthy, sexually active medical students. Studies were done pre- and postmenstrually and at midcycle for two consecutive menstrual cycles. The mean number of adherent bacteria per vaginal epithelial cell (range) was 3.4 (0 to 14) for E. coli, 60.5 (12 to 152) for Lactobacillus species, 54.8 (21 to 76) for group B streptococci, 67.4 (15 to 161) for G. vaginalis, and 58.9 (15 to 186) diplococci for N. gonorrhoeae. Adherence of G. vaginalis increased with increasing acidity of the test medium (pH 4 to 8). There were no significant differences in adherence to vaginal epithelial cells obtained at the various times in the menstrual cycle for any of the organisms (p greater than 0.05). The pattern and extent of adherence among the women was similar for each organism. In this in vitro model, adherence characteristics did not vary with the menstrual cycle.

TI  - Sexually transmitted conditions among women college students.
AB  - We studied 500 unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. Most participants were symptom-free and had normal physical examinations. Few sexually transmitted infections were encountered. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was recovered from two and Trichomonas vaginalis was obtained from 14 of 500 women. Chlamydia trachomatis was recovered from 20 (4.6%) of 439 participants. Genital warts, genital herpes, and molluscum contagiosum, respectively, were noted in seven, four, and one of the 500 participants. There was no cases of syphilis, scabies, or pediculosis pubis. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, respectively, were recovered from 17.6 and 56.8% of the subjects. Prevalent vaginal bacteria included lactobacilli, streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal specimens of about one third of the participants.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - To study the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we analyzed vaginal fluid from normal women and from 53 women with nonspecific vaginitis, using quantitative anaerobic cultures and gas-liquid chromatography for short-chained organic-acid metabolites of the microbial flora. In normal vaginal fluid, lactate was the predominant acid, and the predominant organisms were lactobacillus and streptococcus species (lactate producers). In nonspecific vaginitis, lactate was decreased, whereas succinate, acetate, butyrate, and propionate were increased, the predominant flora included Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis (acetate producer), and anaerobes, which included bacteroides species (succinate producers) and peptococcus species (butyrate and acetate producers). After metronidazole therapy, symptoms and signs of nonspecific vaginitis cleared, butyrate and propionate disappeared, and lactate and lactate-producing organisms became predominant. We conclude that certain anaerobes act with G. vaginalis as causes of nonspecific vaginitis, and that a high ratio of succinate to lactate in vaginal fluid is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of this condition.
TI  - Inhibition of some normal and pathogenic vaginal bacteria by oral and vaginal streptococci.
AB  - Hemolytic and nonhemolytic strains of Streptococcus faecalis, together with some  strains of oral and vaginal alpha-hemolytic streptococci, produced one or more factors that inhibited the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and a variety of other vaginal bacteria. Some streptococci were inhibitory to indicator organisms only in the presence of catalase, whereas catalase either enhanced or prevented inhibitory action for still other streptococci. The inhibitors produced by certain streptococci resembled enterococcal bacteriocins, which have not previously been found to inhibit G. vaginalis or N. gonorrhoeae.

TI  - The role of fomites in the transmission of vaginitis.
AB  - A role for fomites such as toilet seats in the transmission of vaginitis has never been proved or disproved. A compilation of clinical data from a university community showed that the organisms found in vaginal cultures of patients with vaginitis were, in order of frequency. Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Hemophilus vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis. In a concurrent bacteriologic survey of washroom fixtures, staphylococci and other micrococci were isolated most frequently. The overt pathogens associated with vaginitis were never found, and gram-negative organisms appeared to be suppressed by the disinfectant used by the cleaning staff. It is clear that fomites are not an important mode of transmission in vaginitis, although a search for specific pathogens on toilets is to be continued.
