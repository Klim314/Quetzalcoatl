TI  - Improved n-butanol tolerance in Escherichia coli by controlling membrane related  functions.
AB  - As the increasing demand from both chemical and fuel markets, the interest in producing n-butanol using biological route has been rejuvenated to engineer an economical fermentation process, competing with the currently-dominant chemical synthesis. n-Butanol has been traditionally produced from the ABE fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum. This system, however, is not economically feasible due to its limited efficiency and the lack of genetic modification tools for further improvements. Alternatively, n-butanol synthesis pathway was successfully transferred into Escherichia coli and rapidly improved to reach a level of production comparable to the native producer. Nevertheless, the toxicity of n-butanol has become a common issue that either approach has to deal with. Previously, we reported our success in improving n-butanol tolerance in E. coli by engineering an Artificial Transcription Factor (ATF) that can modify the expression level of multiple targets simultaneously and improved the n-butanol tolerance of MG1655 strain to 1.5% (vol/vol) n-butanol. However, it was observed that some possible n-butanol tolerance mechanisms did not occurred upon the ATF expression, especially the membrane-related functions such as the homeoviscous adaptation, iron uptaking system, and efflux pump system. In this work, we attempted to enhance the n-butanol tolerance associated with the ATF by combining it with the membrane-related functions in E. coli, including the overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes, iron-uptaking protein FeoA, and introducing a SrpABC efflux pump from Pseudomonas putida into E. coli. The synergistic effect of this combinatorial approach led to 4, 5, and 9-fold improved growths in the cultures containing 1, 1.5, and 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol, respectively, of an MG1655 knockout strain engineered for n-butanol production, and expanded the tolerance limit to 2% (vol/vol) n-butanol.
TI  - Engineering cellular robustness of microbes by introducing the GroESL chaperonins from extremophilic bacteria.
AB  - The cellular robustness is a big concern for efficient microbial production of biofuels and biochemicals. In this study, the groESL genes from extremophilic bacteria were found to serve as transplantable stress-response elements to improve diverse types of stress-tolerances of other microbes. By overexpressing the groESL from the solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida in Escherichia coli, its thermo-tolerance and ethanol-tolerance were significantly increased. Meanwhile, the groESL from the thermophilic Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis endowed Clostridium acetobutylicum with improved corn cob hydrolysates (CCH)-tolerance as well as elevated butanol productivity. The chaperonins GroESL have been widely considered as cellular stress-response proteins and overexpression of native groESL has been proven to improve cellular tolerances facing various stresses. Here we found that the groESL genes from extremophilic bacteria were superior to the native ones, possibly because they have adapted to the environmental stresses during long-term natural evolution. Moreover, our results also revealed that different extreme groESL genes performed quite different in different microbes. Thus the relation and compatibility between the extremophiles and the host must be considered for selection of the proper groESL for engineering microbial robustness.
TI  - The biology of habitat dominance; can microbes behave as weeds?
AB  - Competition between microbial species is a product of, yet can lead to a reduction in, the microbial diversity of specific habitats. Microbial habitats can resemble ecological battlefields where microbial cells struggle to dominate and/or annihilate each other and we explore the hypothesis that (like plant weeds) some microbes are genetically hard-wired to behave in a vigorous and ecologically aggressive manner. These 'microbial weeds' are able to dominate the communities that develop in fertile but uncolonized--or at least partially vacant--habitats via traits enabling them to out-grow competitors; robust tolerances to habitat-relevant stress parameters and highly efficient energy-generation systems; avoidance of or resistance to viral infection, predation and grazers; potent antimicrobial systems; and exceptional abilities to sequester and store resources. In addition, those associated with nutritionally complex habitats are extraordinarily versatile in their utilization of diverse substrates. Weed species typically deploy multiple types of antimicrobial including toxins; volatile organic compounds that act as either hydrophobic or highly chaotropic stressors; biosurfactants; organic acids; and moderately chaotropic solutes that are produced in bulk quantities (e.g. acetone, ethanol). Whereas ability to dominate communities is habitat-specific we suggest that some microbial species are archetypal weeds including generalists such as: Pichia anomala, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas putida; specialists such as Dunaliella salina, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus spp. and other lactic acid bacteria; freshwater autotrophs Gonyostomum semen and Microcystis aeruginosa; obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium acetobutylicum; facultative pathogens such as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Pantoea ananatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and other extremotolerant and extremophilic microbes such as Aspergillus spp., Salinibacter ruber and Haloquadratum walsbyi. Some microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudoxylaria spp., exhibit characteristics of both weed and non-weed species. We propose that the concept of nonweeds represents a 'dustbin' group that includes species such as Synodropsis spp., Polypaecilum pisce, Metschnikowia orientalis, Salmonella spp., and Caulobacter crescentus. We show that microbial weeds are conceptually distinct from plant weeds, microbial copiotrophs, r-strategists, and other ecophysiological groups of microorganism. Microbial weed species are unlikely to emerge from stationary-phase or other types of closed communities; it is open habitats that select for weed phenotypes. Specific characteristics that are common to diverse types of open habitat are identified, and implications of weed biology and open-habitat ecology are discussed in the context of further studies needed in the fields of environmental and applied microbiology.
TI  - Engineering alternative butanol production platforms in heterologous bacteria.
AB  - Alternative microbial hosts have been engineered as biocatalysts for butanol biosynthesis. The butanol synthetic pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum was first re-constructed in Escherichia coli to establish a baseline for comparison to other hosts. Whereas polycistronic expression of the pathway genes resulted in the production of 34 mg/L butanol, individual expression of pathway genes elevated titers to 200 mg/L. Improved titers were achieved by co-expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae formate dehydrogenase while overexpression of E. coli glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to elevate glycolytic flux improved titers to 580 mg/L. Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis were also explored as alternative production hosts. Polycistronic expression of butanol biosynthetic genes yielded butanol titers of 120 and 24 mg/L from P. putida and B. subtilis, respectively. Production in the obligate aerobe P. putida was dependent upon expression of bcd-etfAB. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering butanol biosynthesis in a variety of heterologous microorganisms, including those cultivated aerobically.
TI  - Identification and functional analysis of dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase gene and its linked gene cluster in an aminoglycoside antibiotics producer of Streptomyces tenebrarius H6.
AB  - Streptomyces tenebrarius H6 produces a variety of aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as apramycin, tobramycin, and kanamycin B. Primers were designed according to the highly conserved sequences of the dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase genes, and a 0.6-kb PCR product was obtained from S. tenebrarius H6 genomic DNA. With the 0.6-kb PCR product as a probe, a BamHI 7.0-kb fragment was isolated. DNA sequence analysis of the 7.0-kb fragment revealed four ORFs and an incomplete ORF. In search of databases, the deduced product of one ORF (orfE) showed 62% identity to the dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase, StrE of S. griseus. Three other ORFs (orfG1, orfG2, and orfGM) showed 55%, 62%, and 42% similarities, respectively, to glycosyltransferase from Clostridium acetobutylicum and mannosyltransferase from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 and glycosyltransferase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Upstream of the orfE was an incomplete ORF, and the deduced product showed 56% similarity to dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose, StrL from S. griseus. The function of the orfE gene was studied by targeted gene disruption. The resulting mutant failed to produce tobramycin and kanamycin B, but still produced apramycin, suggesting that the orfE gene and linked gene cluster are essential for the biosynthesis of tobramycin and kanamycin B in S. tenebrarius H6.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Amino acid sequence of the pyruvate and the glyoxylate active-site lysine peptide of Escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase.
AB  - Pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase of Escherichia coli, a "lysine-type" trimeric enzyme which has the unique properties of forming an "abortive" Schiff-base intermediate with glyoxylate (the aldehydic product/substrate) and of showing strong beta-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate, binds any one of its substrates (2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate) in a competitive manner. To determine whether the substrates bind at the same or different (juxta-positioned) sites and what degree of homology might exist between the active-site lysine peptide of this enzyme and that of other lysine-type (Class I) aldolases or beta-decarboxylases, the azomethine formed separately by this aldolase with either [14C]pyruvate or [14C]glyoxylate was reduced with CNBH3-. After each enzyme adduct was digested with trypsin, the 14C-labeled peptide was isolated, purified, and subjected to amino acid analysis and sequence determination. In each case, the same 14-amino acid lysine-peptide was isolated and found to have the following primary sequence: Glu-Phe-*Lys-Phe-Phe-Pro-Ala-Glu-Ala-Asn-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys (where * = the active-site lysine). Hence, glyoxylate competes for, and inhibits aldolase activity by reacting with, the one active-site lysine residue/subunit. This active-site lysine peptide has a high degree (65%) of homology with that of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of Pseudomonas putida but is not similar to that of any Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or of acetoacetate beta-decarboxylase of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Furthermore, it was found that extensive reaction of glyoxylate with the N-terminal amino group of this enzyme may well be general complicating factor in sequence studies with proteins plus glyoxylate.
TI  - Selection of bacteria with favorable transport properties through porous rock for the application of microbial-enhanced oil recovery.
AB  - This paper presents a bench-scale study on the transport in highly permeable porous rock of three bacterial species-Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Clostridium acetobutylicum-potentially applicable in microbial-enhanced oil recovery processes. The transport of cells during the injection of bacterial suspension and nutrient medium was simulated by a deep bed filtration model. Deep bed filtration coefficients and the maximum capacity of cells in porous rock were measured. Low to intermediate ( approximately 10/ml) injection concentrations of cellular suspensions are recommended because plugging of inlet surface is less likely to occur. In addition to their resistance to adverse environments, spores of clostridia are strongly recommended for use in microbial-enhanced oil recovery processes since they are easiest among the species tested to push through porous rock. After injection, further transport of bacteria during incubation can occur by growth and mobility through the stagnant nutrient medium which fills the porous rock. We have developed an apparatus to study the migration of bacteria through a Berea sandstone core containing nutrient medium.
