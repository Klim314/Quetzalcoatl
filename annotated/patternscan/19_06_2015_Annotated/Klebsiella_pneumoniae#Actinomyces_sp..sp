TI  == metastatic abscess formation in a preexisting chest wall tumor: a rare initial presentation of klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess.
AB  == the common infectious agents in the chest wall include mycobacterium tuberculosis, actinomyces, fungi, nocardia, entamoeba histolytica, and other aerobes and anaerobes. klebsiella pneumoniae is an uncommon etiological agent. we describe a case of ankylosing spondylitis in a 45-year-old man, who had exhibited a painless lump in the left posterior chest wall for 3 months and who presented with acute-onset pain, erythematous change, and fever in the 2 weeks before admission. cultures of the blood and chest wall abscess both showed gram-negative bacilli, which were classified as k. pneumoniae. a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a nonenhancing cystic abscess measuring 4.9 x 6.5 x 6.4 cm in segment 6 of the liver and communicating with the chest wall. drainage of the liver abscess under ultrasound guidance and open surgical drainage of the chest wall abscess combined with adequate antibiotic treatment resolved the abscess.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == etiology and outcome of community-acquired lung abscess.
AB  == background: anaerobes are the first and streptococcus species the second most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess (cala) in the west. the etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in taiwan, with klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of cala. objective: to determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 japanese adult patients with cala to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. we used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle  aspiration and protected specimen brushes. results: of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. the four most common etiologic pathogens were streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), gemella species (9.8%), and k. pneumoniae (8.2%). streptococcus mitis was the most common among the streptococcus species. mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. conclusions: the first and second most common etiologic pathogens of cala in our hospital were streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. the etiologies in our study differ from those in taiwan  and are similar to those in the west with the exception that streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in western countries. s. mitis and gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. the identification of  actinomyces and nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration.

TI  == [a case of empyema due to capnocytophaga sp. and actinomyces israelii].
AB  == a 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of cough, sputum production, and fever of 1 month's duration. his diabetes mellitus was poorly controlled, and his hemoglobin hba1c value was elevated at 10.9%. chest x-ray film and computed tomography scan showed bilateral but predominantly right-sided  pleural effusion. aspiration of the pleural fluid from the right-side showed frank pus, and empyema was diagnosed. capnocytophaga sp. and actinomyces israelii were isolated in the pleural effusion and were regarded as the pathogens causing  the empyema. klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in his sputum, and it may also have been a possible pathogen. the patient improved with administration of antibiotics (6 g/day ampicillin/sulbactam, 3 g/day ceftazidime hydrate and 1200 mg/day clindamycin) and chest tube drainage. he was discharged and regularly followed on an outpatient basis. we report this rare case of capnocytophaga sp. and actinomyces israelii as the pathogenic causes of empyema.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of sodium bicarbonate, sodium metaperiodate and sds combination against dental unit waterline-associated bacteria and yeast.
AB  == aim: to determine the effect of sodium bicarbonate (sb), sodium metaperiodate (smp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) combination on biofilm formation and dispersal in dental unit waterline (duwl)-associated bacteria and yeast. methods  and results: the in vitro effect of sb, smp and sds alone and in combination on biofilm formation and dispersal in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans was investigated using a 96-well microtitre plate biofilm assay. the combination showed a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on growth as well as biofilm formation of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and yeast. in addition, the sb + smp + sds combination was significantly more effective in dispersing biofilm than the individual compounds. the combination dispersed more than 90% of p. aeruginosa biofilm whereas the commercial products, oxygenal 6, sterilex ultra, and perasafe showed no biofilm dispersal activity. conclusion: the composition comprising sb,  smp, and sds was effective in inhibiting as well as dispersing biofilms in duwl-associated bacteria and yeast. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that a composition comprising environmentally friendly and biologically safe compounds such as sb, smp, and sds has a potential application  in reducing duwl-associated acquired infections in dental clinics.

TI  == community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in harare, zimbabwe.
AB  == background: hiv infection is common in mothers and their children in zimbabwe, and hiv-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. there is little information on the etiology and outcome of hiv-related bacteremia in african children. methods: blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having hiv, were examined for pathogens.  the association among significant bacteremia, hiv infection and mortality was assessed in these children. results: the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). nontyphoidal salmonella (10 children), escherichia coli (4 children) and klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent gram-negative bacteria. two children had rhodococcus equi pneumonia. hiv-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (or) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (or = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (or = 15.76). there was no  significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. mortality was 17%  overall but was higher in hiv-infected children up to 6 months of age (or = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (or = 2.03). conclusions: prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in hiv-infected children in africa.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == production of menaquinones by intestinal anaerobes.
AB  == ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. two other bacteroides species, bacteroides disiens and bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. a single isolate of bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. these  constituents were found in all of five strains of escherichia coli, all of four strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of propionibacterium species, two of five strains of eubacterium species, and the one strain each of arachnia propionica and veillonella parvula tested. no menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera fusobacterium, clostridium, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, actinomyces, peptococcus, or peptostreptococcus. these findings suggest that e. coli, bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin k  in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin k1.
