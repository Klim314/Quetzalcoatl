TI  == spatiotemporal development of the bacterial community in a tubular longitudinal microbial fuel cell.
AB  == the spatiotemporal development of a bacterial community in an exoelectrogenic biofilm was investigated in sucrose-fed longitudinal tubular microbial fuel cell  reactors, consisting of two serially connected modules. the proportional changes  in the microbial community composition were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing in order to relate them to the performance and stability of the bioelectrochemical system. the reproducibility of duplicated reactors, evaluated by cluster analysis and jaccard's coefficient, shows 80-90% similarity in species composition. biofilm development through fed-batch start-up and subsequent stable continuous operation results in a population shift from gamma-proteobacteria- and bacteroidetes- to firmicutes-dominated communities, with other diverse species present at much lower relative proportions. dgge patterns were analysed by range-weighted richness (rr) and pareto-lorenz evenness distribution curves to investigate the evolution of the bacterial community. the first modules shifted from dominance by species closely related to bacteroides graminisolvens, raoultella ornithinolytica and klebsiella sp. bm21 at the start of continuous-mode operation to a community dominated by paludibacter propionicigenes-, lactococcus sp.-, pantoea agglomerans- and klebsiella oxytoca-related species with stable power generation (6.0 w/m(3)) at day 97. operational strategies that consider the dynamics of the population will provide  useful parameters for evaluating system performance in the practical application  of microbial fuel cells.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
