TI  - Actinomyces bacteremia in association with tubo-ovarian abscesses and hysteroscopic sterilization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinomyces infection is well-documented in intrauterine devices but  has not been previously associated with hysteroscopic sterilization using coil inserts. Additionally, abscesses associated with these implants have been observed in few cases. CASE: A 31-year-old multiparous woman with a history of hysteroscopic sterilization with coil inserts 18 months previously presented with several weeks of pelvic pain. Despite percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses, her pain and fevers persisted. Blood cultures were positive for Actinomyces infection, and exploratory laparotomy demonstrated abscesses at both coil sites. CONCLUSION: When a causative organism cannot be identified or the when patient does not respond to standard antibiotic therapy, Actinomyces infection should be considered because prolonged antibiotic therapy is necessary.
TI  - Bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw: a study of 18 cases associated with fungal infection.
AB  - Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a serious complication associated with oral and intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. Its pathogenesis is not well understood and its management is difficult. Microbiological investigations have detected a variety of oral pathogens such as Actinomyces, Enterococcus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus, Haemophilus influenzae, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To better treat it, it is important to understand its causes and complications. Materials and Methods. Our present study addresses a microscopic observation of curetted jaw necrotic lesions related to bisphosphonates. Results. A mycotic infestation has been found in all of the 18 cases studied. Discussion. An identification of the fungal agent and its incrimination in the pathogenesis of bisphosphonates related osteonecrosis of the jaw could change radically the management of this condition.
TI  - Divergent pro-inflammatory profile of human dendritic cells in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria associated with the airway microbiota.
AB  - Recent studies using culture-independent methods have characterized the human airway microbiota and report microbial communities distinct from other body sites. Changes in these airway bacterial communities appear to be associated with inflammatory lung disease, yet the pro-inflammatory properties of individual bacterial species are unknown. In this study, we compared the immune stimulatory capacity on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) of selected airway commensal and pathogenic bacteria predominantly associated with lungs of asthma or COPD patients (pathogenic Haemophillus spp. and Moraxella spp.), healthy lungs (commensal Prevotella spp.) or both (commensal Veillonella spp. and Actinomyces spp.). All bacteria were found to induce activation of DCs as demonstrated by similar induction of CD83, CD40 and CD86 surface expression. However, asthma and COPD-associated pathogenic bacteria provoked a 3-5 fold higher production of IL-23, IL-12p70 and IL-10 cytokines compared to the commensal bacteria. Based on the differential cytokine production profiles, the studied airway bacteria could be segregated into three groups (Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella spp. vs. Prevotella spp. and Veillonella spp. vs. Actinomyces spp.) reflecting their pro-inflammatory effects on DCs. Co-culture experiments found that Prevotella spp. were able to reduce Haemophillus influenzae-induced IL-12p70 in DCs, whereas no effect was observed on IL-23 and IL-10 production. This study demonstrates intrinsic differences in DC stimulating properties of bacteria associated with the airway microbiota.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Clinical characteristics and factors associated the outcome of lacrimal canaliculitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the clinical and microbiological characteristics and factors  associated with the outcome of lacrimal canaliculitis. METHODS: Thirty four patients (34 eyes) treated for lacrimal canaliculitis between January 2001 and December 2006 in a tertiary medical centre were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and microbiological profiles, treatment outcome, and risk factors related to recurrence and concretions formation were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 10 males and 24 females with a mean age of 64 years. The average time lapse to diagnosis was 18 months. Lower canaliculus (91%) was most commonly involved. Six patients (18%) had both upper and lower canaliculitis. Culture positive specimens were 21 of 25 (84%), with a mixed infection of 7 (28%). Streptococcus species (28%), Staphylococcus species (20%), and Actinomyces (16%) were the most commonly cultured organisms. Concretions were noted in nine patients (26%). All cultures of concretions were positive. No specific factor was found to be related to concretions formation. Canaliculotomy was performed in 25 patients (74%). Recurrence developed in seven patients (21%), with a mean time to recurrence of 24 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that male patients (p=0.038) and presence of concretions (p=0.001) were associated with higher recurrent rate. Both patients with Haemophilus influenzae isolate developed recurrence (100%). CONCLUSION: Canaliculitis are often delayed diagnosed and prone to recur or persist. Male gender and concretions are important risk factors for recurrence. Surgical removal of all possible concretions is essential for cure.
TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - Improved enrichment broth for cultivation of fastidious organisms.
AB  - An enrichment broth developed in our laboratory, fastidious broth (FB), was compared with two commercially available broth media, supplemented thioglycolate broth and enriched eugonic broth. FB supported the growth of a number of organisms that were not cultivatable in either of the other two media, including Corynebacterium jeikeium, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, for several organisms that were able to grow in all three broths, including Neisseria meningitidis, Nocardia asteroides, and Actinomyces spp., both the time of incubation and the starting inoculum necessary to enable detection of growth were decreased significantly by using FB.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  - Aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. Of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). Aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases and together with anaerobes in 87. The most common aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), Streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). Anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, Prevotella intermedia from 32%, Peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, Fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and Actinomyces odontolyticus from 23%. The rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with S. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with F. necrophorum (P < .01). Recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with F. necrophorum than among those infected with S. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; P < .0001) or with S. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; P < .05). beta-Lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of Prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients studied harbored one or more such strains.
TI  - A comparative study of cephradine, amoxycillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of acute dentoalveolar infection.
AB  - A comparative double blind trial was undertaken of the efficacy of cephradine, amoxycillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of acute dentoalveolar abscesses. Patients were admitted to the trial with acute dentoalveolar abscesses with systemic involvement and assessments were made of pain, swelling, temperature and lymphadenopathy. After admission to the trial appropriate surgical therapy was undertaken. The patients were then given either phenoxymethylpenicillin 250 mg four times daily, cephradine 500 mg twice daily or amoxycillin 250 mg three times daily, all for 5 days. The patients were assessed after 2 days and 5 days. All the patients recovered with those taking cephradine showing the best recovery in the first two days of treatment.
TI  - Dental plaque development on defined streptococcal surfaces.
AB  - Coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. A new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with a continuous layer of bacteria. Chips were covered with Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or Streptococcus gordonii S7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4 and 24 h. There were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. However, the number of Actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total Actinomyces spp. was significantly different on the two surfaces at 24 h. With the exception of Actinomyces naeslundii and A. viscosus removed from the S7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. This study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. Thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  - Normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  - Bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 Danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. Thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml]. In 25% of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml. The microorganisms isolated most frequently were: Streptococcus, sp. ("Viridans group"), Veillonella parvula, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Lactobacillus, sp., Corynebacterium, sp., Actinomyces, sp., Bacteroides, sp., and Hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. The upper range for the number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. Enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and Enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  - Indirect fluorescent-antibody method for the identification of Corynebacterium vaginale.
AB  - The indirect fluorescent-antibody technique was employed in an attempt to develop a rapid method of identification of Corynebacterium vaginale. Six reference strains and ten clinical isolates selected on the basis of morphology and conventional biochemical tests were compared. Antisera were prepared in rabbits against the six reference strains. The most satisfactory antiserum was that prepared using strain 14018 grown diphasically (14018 Di) as the antigen. Certain of the antisera did exhibit a cross-reacting titer when reacted against Corynebacterium diptheriae, Corynebacterium xerosis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus. However, antisera adsorbed with these bacteria did not exhibit a significant decrease in titer when reacted against the homologous strain. Various other species of Corynebacterium as well as species of Nocardia, Actinomyces, Hemophilus, and Streptococcus did not fluoresce with the antisera. A specific antiserum was prepared by adsorbing anti-14018 Di with L. acidophilus. The adsorption removed the cross-reacting antibody but did not affect the staining reaction with C. vaginale strains. All reference strains and clinical isolates characterized as C. vaginale gave a definite positive reaction with the adsorbed anti-14018 Di. The specificity of the reactions was assessed by adsorbing the antiserum with the homologous strain. The data suggest that the indirect staining method will be of value in the rapid presumptive identification of C. vaginale.
