TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == structure of alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from streptococcus sp.: a template for the mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  == the fad-dependent alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase (glpo) from enterococcus casseliflavus and streptococcus sp. was originally studied as a soluble flavoprotein oxidase; surprisingly, the glpo sequence is 30-43% identical to those of the alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenases (glpds) from mitochondrial and bacterial sources. the structure of a deletion mutant of streptococcus sp. glpo (glpodelta, lacking a 50-residue insert that includes a flexible surface region)  has been determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data and refined at 2.3 a resolution. using the glpodelta structure as a search model, we have also determined the intact glpo structure, as refined at 2.4 a resolution. the first two domains of the glpo fold are most closely related to those of the flavoprotein glycine oxidase, where they function in fad binding and substrate binding, respectively; the glpo c-terminal domain consists of two helix bundles and is not closely related to any known structure. the flexible surface region in intact glpo corresponds to a segment of missing electron density that links the substrate-binding domain to a betabetaalpha element of the fad-binding domain. in accordance with earlier biochemical studies (stabilizations of the covalent fad-n5-sulfite adduct and p-quinonoid form of 8-mercapto-fad), ile430-n, thr431-n, and thr431-og are hydrogen bonded to fad-o2alpha in glpodelta, stabilizing the negative charge in these two modified flavins and facilitating transfer of a hydride to fad-n5 (from glp) as well. active-site overlays with the glycine oxidase-n-acetylglycine and d-amino acid oxidase-d-alanine complexes demonstrate that arg346 of glpodelta is structurally equivalent to arg302 and arg285, respectively; in both cases, these residues interact directly with the amino acid substrate or inhibitor carboxylate. the structural and functional divergence between glpo and the bacterial and mitochondrial glpds is also discussed.

TI  == antibody binding to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis cell fractions.
AB  == objective: to determine which cell fraction(s) of streptococcus mitis biovar 1 serve as the best source of antigens recognized by salivary siga antibodies in infants. design: whole cells of 38 reference and wild-type isolates of s. mitis,  streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus faecalis were fractionated into cell walls (cw), protease-treated cell walls (ptcw), cell membranes (cm) and cell protein (cp). whole cells and these fractions were tested for binding by rabbit anti-s. mitis sk145 and anti-s. oralis sk100 sera, and also by salivary siga antibodies from infants and adults.  results: anti-sk145 and anti-sk100 sera bound whole cells and fractions of all strains of s. mitis and s. oralis variably. cluster analysis of antibody binding  data placed the strains into s. mitis, s. oralis and 'non-s. mitis/non-s. oralis' clusters. antigens from cw and cm best discriminated s. mitis from s. oralis. cm  bound the most infant salivary siga antibody and ptcw bound the least. in contrast, adult salivary siga antibody bound all of the cell fractions and at higher levels. conclusions: presumably the relatively short period of immune stimulation and immunological immaturity in infants, in contrast to adults, result in low levels of salivary siga antibody that preferentially bind cm of s.  mitis but not ptcw. by utilizing isolated cell walls and membranes as sources of  antigens for proteomics it may be possible to identify antigens common to oral streptococci and dissect the fine specificity of salivary siga antibodies induced by oral colonization by s. mitis.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of enterococci found in marine and intertidal sediments and coastal water in southern california.
AB  == aims: to determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. methods and results: faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. high levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. bacterial isolates presumptively identified as enterococcus on mei media were speciated. the predominant species found in both water and sediment included enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus mundtii. a number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mei media were subsequently identified as species other than enterococcus. at both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. conclusions: high levels of enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. significance and impact of the study: resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.

TI  == management of purulent pericarditis.
AB  == a 50 year old man was admitted to icu due to purulent pericarditis, purulent inflammation of the soft tissue of the neck, purulent mediastinitis and pneumonia. subxyphoid periocardiotomy followed by the insertion of a drain into the pericardial space was performed. four other drains were also inserted to drain purulent fluid from the neck (two drains) and mediastinum (two drains). during the surgical procedure, 700 ml of purulent pericardial fluid from the pericardial sac and 200 ml of purulent fluid from the mediastinum were drained. antibiotic therapy was started upon admission to the hospital. streptococcus species, acinetobacter baumani and enterococcus casseliflavus were cultured. antibiotic therapy was adjusted to the results of the antibiogram. despite revised antibiotic therapy, daily drainage from the pericardium--during several days after surgery--was around 200 ml. due to the huge purulent pericardial drainage streptokinase, delivered directly into pericardial space, was given. the clinical effect of intrapericardial streptokinase administration was excellent. after 17 days drainage of purulent pericardial fluid was not observed. no clinical signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis developed. repeated echocardiography examinations showed no signs of constrictive pericarditis and no pericardial fluid. the patient was discharged in good general condition.

TI  == source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  == enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the  intestines of insects and birds. the source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is  unknown. in the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) was used to type 646 enterococcus strains which were isolated from a cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. nine different pfge patterns, three of enterococcus casseliflavus, five of enterococcus faecalis, and one of enterococcus durans, were found. the same three clones, one of e. faecalis and two of e. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. the two e. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. it is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as enterococcus faecium and streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk  or the cheese.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, rwj-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. we compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, rwj-54428 (mc-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 enterococcus faecalis, 20 enterococcus faecium, 10 enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 streptococcus  pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. the mic(90) of rwj-54,428 was  < or = 2 mg/l for all groups of bacteria tested except e. faecium. the activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/l).

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  == the recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. during a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a  variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (eva broth multiple tube test) used for public health purposes. the predominant species were enterococcus faecalis (39%)  and ent. faecium (29%), followed by ent. durans/hirae, ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. only one isolate was identified as belonging to the streptococcus genus. the authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. this may help  to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. all isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.

TI  == cloning of insertion sequence is1485 from enterococcus species.
AB  == we have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, is1485, that was present in  several members of the genus enterococcus. is1485 exists in varying copy numbers  with at least 12 copies in e. durans (atcc 11576), 3 copies in e. faecium (atcc 19434), and one copy each in e. faecalis (atcc 19433) and e. avium (atcc 14024).  it was also detected in clinical strains of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, and  e. saccharolyticus. is1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfa, orfb, and orfc. the largest, orfb, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfa; orfc is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfa. the genetic organization of is1485 resembles that of members of the is3 family of transposable elements. sequence homology exists with several members of the is3 family especially with is199 from streptococcus mutans.

AB  == investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium  were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be  moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of  e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were  detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.

TI  == pseudo-outbreak of enterococcus durans infections and colonization associated with introduction of an automated identification system software update.
AB  == enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the united states. although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. raffinosus, and e. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. in january 1996, the centers for disease control and prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31  of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as e. durans. twenty-nine isolates identified as e. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (vitek gram-positive identification card, version r09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. when seven isolates initially reported as e.  durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be e. faecium. subsequently, isolates identified as e. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as e. durans. automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. when laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins from enterococcus faecium with activity against  listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == laboratory cultures and environmental isolates of bacteria were screened for antagonism towards listeria monocytogenes using an agar spot test. seven of the 163 strains that were tested, one streptococcus bovis, one enterococcus casseliflavus, two e. avium and three e. faecium, consistently displayed antilisterial activity. cell-free, ph-neutralized supernatants prepared from the  three e. faecium strains (jbl1061, jbl1083 and jbl1351) exhibited strong antilisterial activity against l. monocytogenes, and were subjected to more detailed analyses. the antagonistic factors produced by these three strains were  sensitive to chloroform and several proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat (121 degrees c, 20 min), and stable over a wide ph range (3.0-10.0). moreover, they were listericidal without causing cell lysis. these data suggest that a bacteriocin(s) is involved in the inhibition of l. monocytogenes by e. faecium jbl1061, jbl1083 and jbl1351.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences of eleven enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. the species e. avium, e. malodoratus, e. pseudoavium and e. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did e. durans, e. faecium, e. hirae and e. mundtii and the pair of species e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. of the remaining species, e. cecorum, e. columbae, e. faecalis and e. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas e. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.

TI  == species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of facklam and collins (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative enterococcus faecalis isolates as enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. the commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. e. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. enterococcus faecium (8.6%), enterococcus avium (0.7%), enterococcus durans (0.3%), enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of e. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.

TI  == use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  == the results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans, e. hirae, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, e. malodoratus and e. mundtii. each species had a specific pattern of at least five pbps, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kda. the pattern of pbps may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.

TI  == enumeration and speciation of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall, their susceptibilities to six antibiotics and a comparison with clinical isolates.
AB  == isolates of group d streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. from below  the sewer outfall, streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, s. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. s. faecalis var. faecalis, s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where s. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. s. faecalis var. liquefaciens and s. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. s. faecium and s. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. the use of group d streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. a statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to  which no resistance was detected. multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the  environmental isolates. even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == taxonomic studies on some group d streptococci.
AB  == biochemical, menaquinone, fatty acid and dna analyses were conducted on a number  of streptococci of serological group d. the results indicate that s. faecalis, s. faeclum, s. casseliflavus and taxa previously designated 's. avium', 's. durans'  and "s. faecalis var. malodoratus' are distinct species. strains previously labelled 's. faecium var. mobilis' were shown to be identical with s. casseliflavus. the results also indicate that some group d streptococci recently  isolated from chickens constitute a new species.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.

TI  == distribution of group d streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated  waters. media used to characterize and speciate group d streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (fc) and faecal streptococci (fs) in river water samples, the fc/fs ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. high concentrations of fc and fs from sediment samples  gave more credible fc/fs ratios. the actual distribution of group d streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. high concentrations of all division ii species (s. faecium, s. faecium var. casseliflavus, and s. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with s. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. low concentrations of division i  group d streptococci (s. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division iii group d streptococci (s. bovis and s. equinus) was made.

TI  == differentiation of some enterococci by gas chromatography.
AB  == relative fatty acid compositions of 37 enterococci were examined by gas chromatography. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, and s. faecium var. durans yielded similar fatty acid patterns. strains of s. faecium var. casseliflavus, and a motile yellow-pigmented streptococcus, contained very low levels of c(19:0) cyclopropane fatty acid and four unidentified components, compared to the other strains of enterococci examined. there were no significant differences in the fatty acid patterns of enterococci grouped according to plant, animal, or human source.

TI  == enterococci in insects.
AB  == enterococci were obtained from 213 of 403 insects cultured during a 14-month period, in numbers from 10(3) to 3 x 10(7)/g of insect. insects were taken only from nonurban, wild, and cultivated fields and woods. in species of insects carrying them, enterococci were not always present in every individual cultured,  and often more than one species of enterococcus occurred within a species. enterococci were obtained from certain insects taken in the field during the dormant season, suggesting their role as overwintering agents. they were generally present in species feeding on nectar, succulent plant parts, and on and ir forest litter, but not from insects feeding on less succulent leaves and stems. streptococcus faecalis was recovered from 32%, streptococcus faecium from  22.4%, and streptococcus faecium var. casseliflavus from 43.5% of members of the  37 taxa of insects. s. faecalis and s. faecium var. casseliflavus exhibit a high  percent of conformity to the properties published for them. the heterogeneity in  properties of s. faecium is similar to that found for the species taken from plants. many fail to grow in broth at 45 c or in broth containing 6.5% nacl; 50%  of the cultures ferment both melezitose and melibiose, and a few ferment neither  sugar. the remainder ferment melibiose only. failure to reduce methylene blue in  milk by s. faecalis and s. faecium is correlated with the inability to ferment lactose. more than 93% of the cultures of s. faecalis digest casein in milk from  the top downward, following the production of a soft, flowing curd. because this  property is not characteristic of s. faecalis taken from humans, the reaction in  litmus milk is suggested as a means of differentiation between cultures of remote and innocent origin in nature and recent, human pollution.
