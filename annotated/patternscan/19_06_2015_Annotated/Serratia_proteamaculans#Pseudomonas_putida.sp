TI  == a bioinformatics approach to the determination of genes involved in endophytic behavior in burkholderia spp.
AB  == the vast majority of plants harbor endophytic bacteria that colonize a portion of the plant's interior tissues without harming the plant. like plant pathogens, endophytes gain entry into their plants hosts through various mechanisms. bacterial endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. the molecular bases of these plant-endophyte interactions are currently not fully understood. in the present study, a set of genes possibly responsible for endophytic behavior for genus burkholderia was predicted and then compared and contrasted with a number (nine endophytes from different genera) of  endophytes by comparative genome analysis. the nine endophytes included burkholderia phytofirmans psjn, burkholderia spp. strain jk006, azospirillum lipoferum 4b, enterobacter cloacae enhku01, klebsiella pneumoniae 342, pseudomonas putida w619, enterobacter spp. 638, azoarcus spp. bh72, and serratia  proteamaculans 568. from the genomes of the analyzed bacterial strains, a set of  bacterial genes orthologs was identified that are predicted to be involved in determining the endophytic behavior of burkholderia spp. the genes and their possible functions were then investigated to establish a potential connection between their presence and the role they play in bacterial endophytic behavior. nearly all of the genes identified by this bioinformatics procedure encode function previously suggested in other studies to be involved in endophytic behavior.

TI  == burkholderia type vi secretion systems have distinct roles in eukaryotic and bacterial cell interactions.
AB  == bacteria that live in the environment have evolved pathways specialized to defend against eukaryotic organisms or other bacteria. in this manuscript, we systematically examined the role of the five type vi secretion systems (t6sss) of burkholderia thailandensis (b. thai) in eukaryotic and bacterial cell interactions. consistent with phylogenetic analyses comparing the distribution of the b. thai t6sss with well-characterized bacterial and eukaryotic cell-targeting t6sss, we found that t6ss-5 plays a critical role in the virulence of the organism in a murine melioidosis model, while a strain lacking the other four t6sss remained as virulent as the wild-type. the function of t6ss-5 appeared to be specialized to the host and not related to an in vivo growth defect, as deltat6ss-5 was fully virulent in mice lacking myd88. next we probed the role of  the five systems in interbacterial interactions. from a group of 31 diverse bacteria, we identified several organisms that competed less effectively against  wild-type b. thai than a strain lacking t6ss-1 function. inactivation of t6ss-1 renders b. thai greatly more susceptible to cell contact-induced stasis by pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens and serratia proteamaculans-leaving it 100- to 1000-fold less fit than the wild-type in competition experiments with  these organisms. flow cell biofilm assays showed that t6s-dependent interbacterial interactions are likely relevant in the environment. b. thai cells lacking t6ss-1 were rapidly displaced in mixed biofilms with p. putida, whereas wild-type cells persisted and overran the competitor. our data show that t6sss within a single organism can have distinct functions in eukaryotic versus bacterial cell interactions. these systems are likely to be a decisive factor in  the survival of bacterial cells of one species in intimate association with those of another, such as in polymicrobial communities present both in the environment  and in many infections.

TI  == comparative effectiveness of pseudomonas and serratia sp. containing acc-deaminase for improving growth and yield of wheat (triticum aestivum l.) under salt-stressed conditions.
AB  == ethylene synthesis is accelerated in response to various environmental stresses like salinity. ten rhizobacterial strains isolated from wheat rhizosphere taken from different salt affected areas were screened for growth promotion of wheat under axenic conditions at 1, 5, 10 and 15 ds m(-1). three strains, i.e., pseudomonas putida (n21), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n39) and serratia proteamaculans (m35) showing promising performance under axenic conditions were selected for a pot trial at 1.63 (original), 5, 10 and 15 ds m(-1). results showed that inoculation was effective even in the presence of higher salinity levels. p. putida was the most efficient strain compared to the other strains and significantly increased the plant height, root length, grain yield, 100-grain weight and straw yield up to 52, 60, 76, 19 and 67%, respectively, over uninoculated control at 15 ds m(-1). similarly, chlorophyll content and k(+)/na(+) of leaves also increased by p. putida over control. it is highly likely that under salinity stress, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid-deaminase activity of these microbial strains might have caused reduction in the synthesis of stress (salt)-induced inhibitory levels of ethylene. the results suggested that these strains could be employed for salinity tolerance in wheat; however, p. putida may have better prospects in stress alleviation/reduction.

TI  == genome survey and characterization of endophytic bacteria exhibiting a beneficial effect on growth and development of poplar trees.
AB  == the association of endophytic bacteria with their plant hosts has a beneficial effect for many different plant species. our goal is to identify endophytic bacteria that improve the biomass production and the carbon sequestration potential of poplar trees (populus spp.) when grown in marginal soil and to gain  an insight in the mechanisms underlying plant growth promotion. members of the gammaproteobacteria dominated a collection of 78 bacterial endophytes isolated from poplar and willow trees. as representatives for the dominant genera of endophytic gammaproteobacteria, we selected enterobacter sp. strain 638, stenotrophomonas maltophilia r551-3, pseudomonas putida w619, and serratia proteamaculans 568 for genome sequencing and analysis of their plant growth-promoting effects, including root development. derivatives of these endophytes, labeled with gfp, were also used to study the colonization of their poplar hosts. in greenhouse studies, poplar cuttings (populus deltoides x populus nigra dn-34) inoculated with enterobacter sp. strain 638 repeatedly showed the highest increase in biomass production compared to cuttings of noninoculated control plants. sequence data combined with the analysis of their metabolic properties resulted in the identification of many putative mechanisms, including  carbon source utilization, that help these endophytes to thrive within a plant environment and to potentially affect the growth and development of their plant hosts. understanding the interactions between endophytic bacteria and their host  plants should ultimately result in the design of strategies for improved poplar biomass production on marginal soils as a feedstock for biofuels.
