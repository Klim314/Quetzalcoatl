TI  == superior prebiotic and physicochemical properties of novel dextran from weissella cibaria jag8 for potential food applications.
AB  == the dextran produced by dextransucrase from weissella cibaria jag8 was subjected  to physicochemical characterization and assessment of its prebiotic potential. dextran displayed a solubility of 24.5% and a water holding capacity of 352%. the emulsion and flocculation activity of dextran were 89% and 92%, respectively. the degradation temperature (td) of dextran was 353 degrees c. dextran exhibited 33-  and 12-fold less hydrolysis than inulin, in simulated gastric juice (ph 1.0) and  alpha-amylase (ph 7.0), respectively. dextran stimulated the growth of probiotic  bacteria such as bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis, bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly and was comparable to that of commercial inulin. however, the growth of e. coli was not enhanced by dextran  or inulin. the dextran used in this study can be used as a potential prebiotic for health benefits.
