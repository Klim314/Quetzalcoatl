TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == optimization of electrotransformation conditions for leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc8293.
AB  == aims: to establish an efficient genetic transformation protocol for leuconostoc species, methods for competent-cell preparation and electroporation conditions were optimized. methods and results: leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides atcc8293 cells were sequentially treated with penicillin g and lysozyme, and the plasmid pleucm was subsequently transformed into the cells. our results demonstrated that transformation efficiencies were significantly increased (100-fold), and increased electric field strength also contributed to enhance transformation efficiency. maximum transformation efficiency (1x10(4) or  more transformants per mug dna) was achieved when cells were grown in de man, rogosa, sharpe (mrs) media containing 0.25 mol l(-1) sucrose and 0.8 mug ml(-1) penicillin g, followed by treatment with 600 u ml(-1) lysozyme and electroporation at a field strength of 10 kv cm(-1). when this protocol was used  to transform pleucm into leuc. mesenteroides, leuconostoc gelidum, leuconostoc fallax and leuconostoc argentinun, successful transformations were obtained in all cases. furthermore, this procedure was applicable to species belonging to other genera, including lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. conclusions: the results demonstrate that the transformation efficiency for leuconostoc spp. could be increased via optimization of the entire electroporation procedures. significance and impact of the study: these optimized conditions can be used for the extensive genetic study and the metabolic engineering of not only leuconostoc spp. but also different species of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from ethnic preserved meat products of the western  himalayas.
AB  == we used culture- and molecular-biology-based methods to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the ethnic chevon (goat) meat products chartayshya, jamma and arjia of the western himalayas. in six chartayshya, six jamma and four arjia samples, lab were the predominant microbial component involved in the fermentation of these samples, and the total lab population in arjia (7.8 +/- 0.1 log cfu g(-1); mean +/- sd) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in chartayshya (6.9 +/- 0.1 log cfu g(-1)) and jamma (7.5 +/- 0.1 log  cfu g(-1)). we identified 53 lab samples by 16s rrna and phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) genes sequencing. the lab isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella cibaria. these results revealed that there is a high level of diversity of lab in the himalayan ethnic preserved meat products.

TI  == exploitation of sweet cherry (prunus avium l.) puree added of stem infusion through fermentation by selected autochthonous lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides were identified from 8 cultivars of sweet cherry by partial 16s rrna gene sequence and subjected  to typing by random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis. representative isolates from each species and each cultivar  were screened based on the kinetics of growth on cherry puree added of (10%, v/v) stem infusion (cp-si). a protocol for processing and storage of cp-si, which included fermentation by selected autochthonous p. pentosaceus swe5 and l. plantarum fp3 (started cp-si) or spontaneous fermentation (unstarted cp-si), was  set up. starters grew and remained viable at elevated cell numbers (ca. 9.0 log cfu g(-1)) during 60 days of storage at 4 degrees c. the number of presumptive lactic acid bacteria of the unstarted cp-si did not exceed the value of ca. 3.0 log cfu g(-1). consumption of carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and fructose) by starter lactic acid bacteria was limited as well as it was the lactic acid fermentation. consumption of organic acids (e.g., malic acid) and free amino acids was evident, especially, throughout storage. compared to cp-si before processing, the concentrations of total phenolic compounds and anthocyanins did not vary in the started cp-si. the concentration of anthocyanins slightly decreased in the unstarted cp-si. the antioxidant activity, expressed as the scavenging activity toward dpph radical, was found at highest level in the started cp-si which approached that found in cp-si before processing. during storage, viscosity and, especially, color indexes of started cp-si were higher than those found in the unstarted cp-si. fermentation by autochthonous lactic acid bacteria seemed to also positively interfere with the sensory attributes of  cp-si.

TI  == the characterisation of lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation of an artisan serbian sausage (petrovska klobasa).
AB  == petrovska klobasa is an artisan serbian sausage made only from meat and spices without any additives or starter cultures. in order to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora, a total number of 404 lab strains were isolated from 15 samples collected during 90 days of the fermentation and 120 days of storage of one batch of petrovska klobasa. the isolates were preliminarily identified by  phenotypic tests and subjected to (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting. representatives of each group were identified by 16s rdna sequencing. the results showed that among  the isolates, lactobacillus sakei and leuconostoc mesenteroides predominate with  36.4% and 37.1% of total lab strains, respectively. pediococcus pentosaceus was also isolated in high proportion (18.4%) whereas enterococcus durans and enterococcus caseliflavus made only 1% and 6% of the total isolates, correspondingly. the analysis of vacuum packed and modified atmosphere packed (map) samples showed higher presence of l. mesenteroides and l. sakei in the total microflora.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1.
AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == probiotics, critical illness, and methodologic bias.
AB  == it has been proposed that probiotics can favorably influence the course of critically ill patients. to address this question, a limited systematic review was undertaken (medline search for articles published in english) to identify randomized, controlled trials that compared a group of critically ill patients taking probiotics with a group that did not. ten such trials, mostly with high risks of methodologic bias, were identified. when the data were combined, the probiotics did not appear to influence mortality or duration of hospitalization.  however, the recipients of the probiotics had fewer infectious episodes (absolute risk difference-21%). this effect was seen particularly in trials employing one combination of probiotic agents (pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum). unfortunately,  this effect may be overly optimistic, as methodologic shortcomings could have introduced biases into the trials. three trials of patients with severe acute pancreatitis were not included in this primary analysis because not all of the patients were in the intensive care unit. the largest of these, and the one with  the lowest risk of bias, demonstrated that probiotics increased mortality, in part because of the precipitation of ischemic bowel disease (in patients who were also receiving postpyloric enteral nutrition infusions). probiotics also appeared to reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients, although these trials did not specifically focus only on those who were critically ill. in summary, it is not clear that probiotics are beneficial (and they may even be harmful) in the critically ill patient group.

TI  == detection of arc genes related with the ethyl carbamate precursors in wine lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == trace amounts of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate can appear in wine by the reaction of ethanol with compounds such as citrulline and carbamyl phosphate, which are produced from arginine degradation by some wine lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this work, the presence of arc genes for the arginine-deiminase pathway was studied in several strains of different species of lab. their ability to degrade arginine was also studied. to detect the presence of arc genes, degenerate primers were designed from the alignment of protein sequences in already sequenced lab. the usefulness of these degenerate primers has been proven by sequencing some of the amplified pcr fragments and searching for homologies with published sequences of the same species and related ones. correlation was found between the presence of genes and the ability to degrade arginine. degrading strains included all heterofermentative lactobacilli, oenococcus oeni , pediococcus pentosaceus , and some strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus plantarum .

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

TI  == characterization and selection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional iberian dry-fermented salchichon and chorizo sausages.
AB  == a total of 192 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 2 types of naturally fermented dry sausages at 3 different stages of the ripening process in order to  select the most suitable strains as starter cultures in dry-cured sausage manufacture according to their technological characteristics such as glucose fermentation, lactic and acetic acid production, and proteolytic, lipolytic, and  antimicrobial activities. identification of the isolates revealed that 31.2% were pediococcus pentosaceus, 26.9% lactococcus lactis, 18.6% pediococcus acidilactici, 17% lactobacillus brevis, and sporadic isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus curvatus. most of the strains did not produce gas from glucose and showed the capacity to produce lactic acid rapidly. some 25% of the strains were able to degrade tributyrin (esterase activity), but none showed lipolytic activity against olive oil and pork fat. only 3 strains of p. acidilactici showed weak proteolytic activity against myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins. also, the same strains showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes. nine strains with the best properties were preselected and tested for biogenic amine production. the results showed that two of the strains, identified as p. acidilactici by polymerase chain reaction, had the potential to be further tested as starter cultures in pilot processing of iberian sausages.

TI  == role of hypermutability in the evolution of the genus oenococcus.
AB  == oenococcus oeni is an alcohol-tolerant, acidophilic lactic acid bacterium primarily responsible for malolactic fermentation in wine. a recent comparative genomic analysis of o. oeni psu-1 with other sequenced lactic acid bacteria indicates that psu-1 lacks the mismatch repair (mmr) genes muts and mutl. consistent with the lack of mmr, mutation rates for o. oeni psu-1 and a second oenococcal species, o. kitaharae, were higher than those observed for neighboring taxa, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. sequence analysis of the rpob mutations in rifampin-resistant strains from both oenococcal species revealed a high percentage of transition mutations, a result indicative of the lack of mmr. an analysis of common alleles in the two sequenced o. oeni strains,  psu-1 and baa-1163, also revealed a significantly higher level of transition substitutions than were observed in other lactobacillales species. these results  suggest that the genus oenococcus is hypermutable due to the loss of muts and mutl, which occurred with the divergence away from the neighboring leuconostoc branch. the hypermutable status of the genus oenococcus explains the observed high level of allelic polymorphism among known o. oeni isolates and likely contributed to the unique adaptation of this genus to acidic and alcoholic environments.

TI  == dna fingerprinting of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut fermentations.
AB  == previous studies using traditional biochemical identification methods to study the ecology of commercial sauerkraut fermentations revealed that four species of  lactic acid bacteria, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and lactobacillus brevis, were the primary microorganisms in these fermentations. in this study, 686 isolates were collected from four commercial fermentations and analyzed by dna fingerprinting. the results indicate that the species of lactic acid bacteria present in sauerkraut fermentations are more diverse than previously reported and include leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc argentinum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus coryniformis, and weissella sp. the newly identified species leuconostoc fallax was also found. unexpectedly, only two isolates of p. pentosaceus and 15 isolates of l. brevis were recovered during this study. a better understanding of the microbiota may aid in the development of low-salt fermentations, which may have altered microflora and altered sensory characteristics.

AB  == background: to study whether enteral pretreatment with a synbiotic composition of lactic acid bacteria and bioactive fibers can reduce peritonitis-induced lung neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury in rats. materials and methods: rats were divided into five groups, and subjected to induction of peritonitis-induced  lung injury using a cecal ligation and puncture model (clp). all animals were pretreated for 3 weeks prior the clp by daily gavage with either (1) a synbiotic  composition (10(10) cfu of pediococcus pentosaceus 5-33:3, 10(10) cfu of leuconostoc mesenteroides 77:1, 10(10) cfu of l. paracasei subspecies paracasei,  10(10) cfu of l. plantarum 2362 plus fermentable fibers), (2) fermentable fibers  alone, (3) nonfermentable fibers, (4) a probiotic composition (10(10) cfu of p. pentosaceus 5-33:3, 10(10) cfu of l. mesenteroides 77:1, 10(10) cfu of l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 10(10) cfu of l. plantarum 2,362), or (5) a heat-killed probiotic composition. all animals were killed 24 hours after clp and lung tissue samples were studied for degree of neutrophil infiltration and levels of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-1beta. in addition the lung wet-to-dry tissue weight ratio, the myeloperoxidase activity, and malondialdehyde content were also assessed. results: no mortality was encountered in any of the groups. histologic signs of lung injury (number of neutrophils and  tnf-alpha, il-1beta staining) were observed in all groups except the synbiotic and probiotic treated groups. myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde content were significantly lower in the two lactobacillus- pretreated groups, with no difference between them. heavy infiltration of lung tissue with neutrophils was observed only in fiber-treated (302.20 +/- 7.92) and placebo-treated (266.90 +/- 8.92) animals. this was totally abolished in the synbiotic-treated group (34.40 +/- 2.49). lung edema (wet-to-dry lung weight ratio) was significantly reduced in the synbiotic-treated group (4.92 +/- 0.13 vs. 5.07 +/- 0.08 and 5.39 +/- 0.10, respectively). conclusion: three weeks of preoperative enteral administration of a synbiotic composition reduced peritonitis-induced acute lung injury in rats in a clp model.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == benefits of a synbiotic formula (synbiotic 2000forte) in critically ill trauma patients: early results of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background: since probiotics are considered to exert beneficial health effects by enhancing the host's immune response, we investigated the benefits of a synbiotics treatment on the rate of infections, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), severe sepsis, and mortality in critically ill, mechanically ventilated, multiple trauma patients. length of stay in the intensive care unit (icu) and number of days under mechanical ventilation were also evaluated. method: sixty-five patients were randomized to receive once daily for 15 days a synbiotic formula (synbiotic 2000forte, medipharm, sweden) or maltodextrin as placebo. the synbiotic preparation consisted of a combination of four probiotics  (10(11) cfu each): pediococcus pentosaceus 5-33:3, leuconostoc mesenteroides 32-77:1, l. paracasei ssp. paracasei 19; and l. plantarum 2,362; and inulin, oat  bran, pectin, and resistant starch as prebiotics. infections, septic complications, mortality, days under ventilatory support, and days of stay in icu were recorded. results: synbiotic-treated patients exhibited a significantly reduced rate of infections (p = 0.01), sirs, severe sepsis (p = 0.02), and mortality. days of stay in the icu (p = 0.01) and days under mechanical ventilation were also significantly reduced in relation to placebo (p = 0.001). conclusion: the administration of this synbiotic formula in critically ill, mechanically ventilated, multiple trauma patients seems to exert beneficial effects in respect to infection and sepsis rates and to improve the patient's response, thus reducing the duration of ventilatory support and intensive care treatment.

TI  == assessment of antibiotic susceptibility within lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from wine.
AB  == susceptibility to 12 antibiotics was tested in 75 unrelated lactic acid bacteria  strains of wine origin of the following species: 38 lactobacillus plantarum, 3 lactobacillus hilgardii, 2 lactobacillus paracasei, 1 lactobacillus sp, 21 oenococcus oeni, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 2 pediococcus parvulus, 1 pediococcus acidilactici, and 3 leuconostoc mesenteroides. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the different antibiotics that inhibited 50% of the strains of  the lactobacillus, leuconostoc and pediococcus genera were, respectively, the following ones: penicillin (2, < or =0.5, and < or =0.5 microg/ml), erythromycin  (< or =0.5 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (4 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (64, 8, and 128 microg/ml), vancomycin (> or =128 microg/ml), tetracycline (8, 2, and 8 microg/ml), streptomycin (256, 32, and 512 microg/ml), gentamicin (64, 4, and 128 microg/ml), kanamycin (256, 64, and 512 microg/ml), sulfamethoxazole (> or =1024  microg/ml), and trimethoprim (16 microg/ml). all 21 o. oeni showed susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, and exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, vancomycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, that could represent intrinsic resistance. differences were observed among the o. oeni strains with respect to penicillin or ciprofloxacin susceptibility. antibiotic resistance genes were studied by pcr and sequencing, and the following genes were detected: erm(b) (one p. acidilactici), tet(m) (one l. plantarum), tet(l) (one p. parvulus), aac(6')-aph(2") (four l. plantarum, one p. parvulus, one p. pentosaceus and two o. oeni), ant(6) (one l. plantarum, and two p. parvulus), and aph(3')-iiia (one l. plantarum and one o. oeni). this is the first time, to our knowledge, that ant(6), aph(3')-iiia and tet(l) genes are found in lactobacillus and pediococcus strains and antimicrobial resistance genes are reported in o. oeni strains.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == rpob gene: a target for identification of lab cocci by pcr-dgge and melting curves analyses in real time pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are essential in the quality of many fermented beverages like beer, cider and wine. in the two later cases, they convert malic acid into lactic acid during the malolactic fermentation. after fermentation, microbial stabilization is needed to prevent the development of spoilage bacteria species. among them, cocci lead to different alterations: pediococcus sp., and some strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides and oenococcus oeni can produce exopolysaccharides which modify wine viscosity and lead to ropiness. they also can produce acetic acid, biogenic amine, ethyl carbamate and volatile phenols. therefore detection and identification are crucial. results of phenotypic tests and dna-dna probes are not accurate enough. 16s rna gene which is currently used  for bacterial species identification presents intraspecies heterogeneity. the rpob gene is an alternative to this limitation. however previous pcr targeting partial sequence of rpob gene could not delimit cocci species. therefore we compared the rpob gene sequence of the six main cocci species found in fermented  beverages: p. damnosus, p. dextrinicus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides and o. oeni. the most discriminating partial sequence of the rpob gene was chosen for designing primers. by pcr-dgge the reliability of these primers was verified. it was controlled in a mixture of several cocci and other lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus sp.). then we adapted the primers and the pcr conditions in order to achieve the identification of cocci species by real time pcr program including the fluorescent dye sybr green i, which gives faster results. pcr melt curves were established and a specific t(m) was attributed to each species.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == 16s-ardra, a tool for identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from grape  must and wine.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are found in a great variety of habitats, including grape must and wines. there is a close relationship between the species of lab which develop during fermentation and the eventual quality of the wine. for these reasons analytical techniques allowing fast and reliable identification of wine lab are needed. in this work a simple and accurate protocol for identifying species of lab isolated from grape must and wine is presented. this protocol is based on the amplification, directly from colony, of 16s rdna and later digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes bfai, msei and alui. a sequential use of the three enzymes is proposed to simplify lab wine identification, first msei, then bfai and finally, if necessary, alui digestion. the technique was able to discriminate 32 of the 36 lab reference species tested and allowed the identification of 342 isolates from musts and wines. the isolates belonged to the species: lactobacillus brevis, l. collinoides, l. coryniformis, l. bilgardii, l.  mali, l. paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus parvulus and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant vanb-type enterococcus d366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  == the biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan udp-murnac-peptide precursors. in all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the  c-terminal d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified c terminus. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in enterococcus faecium d366, a strain belonging to the vanb class, which expresses low-level resistance  to vancomycin, was udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, identical  to that previously found in the vana class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. high-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by r39 d,d-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in lactobacillus casei and pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. the low-level natural resistance of enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a udp-murnac-pentapeptide containing a c-terminal d-serine. the distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide.

AB  == the availability of peptidoglycan for binding to vancomycin was investigated in intrinsically vancomycin-resistant clinical isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus viridescens and pediococcus pentosaceus. intrinsic vancomycin resistance expressed by l. mesenteroides and p. pentosaceus was the result of poor binding of vancomycin to native or sds-treated cell walls. pre-exposure of l. viridescens to vancomycin decreased the subsequent binding of  vancomycin to the cell walls, suggesting an alternative mechanism to that found in high-level vancomycin-resistant enterococci and intrinsically-resistant l. mesenteroides and p. pentosaceus. vancomycin binding was sensitive to substitution of larger side chains at the c-terminus. variations of peptidoglycan peptide types found in l. mesenteroides, l. viridescens and p. pentosaceus could  account for their intrinsic vancomycin resistance.
