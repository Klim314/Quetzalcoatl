TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of bacteremia caused by eggerthella, paraeggerthella, and eubacterium species at a university hospital in taiwan from  2001 to 2010.
AB  == we describe 16 patients with bacteremia caused by eggerthella lenta (n = 7), paraeggerthella hongkongensis (n = 3), eubacterium limosum (n = 4), eubacterium callanderi (n = 1), and concomitant eubacterium limosum/eggerthella lenta (n = 1). nine (56%) patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. the overall 60-day mortality rate was 19%, and all deaths occurred in patients with e. lenta bacteremia.

TI  == bacterial conversion of secoisolariciresinol and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol.
AB  == aims: it has been investigated whether secoisolariciresinol (seco) and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (ahs), an acid degradation product of seco, could be  fermented in a similar way, and to a similar extent, by members of the intestinal microbiota. methods and results: ahs and seco were demethylated by peptostreptococcus productus, eubacterium limosum and clostridium methoxybenzovorans. these bacteria have been identified as members of the human intestinal flora or closely related species. demethylated ahs and demethylated seco were purified by preparative rp-hplc, and subsequently subjected to fermentation with eggerthella lenta, clostridium scindens and clostridium hiranonis. eggerthella lenta efficiently dehydroxylated demethylated seco to enterodiol, whereas the other bacteria showed no dehydroxylation activity. conclusions: the conversion of the diol structure of seco into the furan ring in  ahs did not influence the demethylation capability of the tested bacteria. the results also showed that the extent of dehydroxylation of demethylated ahs was much lower than that of demethylated seco. significance and impact of the study:  plant lignans are converted into bioactive mammalian lignans by the human intestinal bacteria. this study showed that the modification of plant lignans resulted in the formation a new type of mammalian lignan.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == phylogenetic evidence for the transfer of eubacterium lentum to the genus eggerthella as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == eubacterium lentum has unique phenotypic characters within the genus eubacterium. the 16s rrna sequence of eubacterium lentum was determined and its phylogenetic position was defined. this micro-organism is a member of the genus eubacterium but it is not closely related to eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium, and is nearer to collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans. a pcr-based identification system using species-specific primers designed on the basis of dna sequences encoding the 16s rrna of strains of eubacterium lentum, collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans is described. a species-specific primer set can distinguish eubacterium lentum from  eubacterium limosum or closely related species including collinsella aerofaciens, coriobacterium glomerans and atopobium species. this species-specific pcr method  can be used to identify eubacterium lentum-like species isolated from human faeces. on the basis of the 16s rrna sequence divergence from collinsella aerofaciens and coriobacterium glomerans and the presence of unique phenotypic characters, a new genus, eggerthella gen. nov., is proposed for eubacterium lentum, with one species, eggerthella lenta comb. nov. the type strain of eggerthella lenta is jcm 9979t.
