TI  - Acinetobacter harbinensis sp. nov., isolated from river water.
AB  - A bacterial strain, HITLi 7T, with nitrifying ability was isolated from the surface water of the Songhua River in China. Cells were Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, oxidase-negative, non-motile coccobacilli, capable of growth in mineral media with acetate as the sole carbon source and ammonia as the sole source of nitrogen. The cells did not grow at 37 degrees C, but did grow at 2 degrees C. The DNA G+C content was 45.5 mol%. Results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated a close relationship between this isolate and Acinetobacter lwoffii (98.4% similarity for strain DSM 2403T). rpoB and gyrB gene sequences did not show significant similarity with those from other species of the genus Acinetobacter. Predominant cellular fatty acids were 9-octadecenoic acid (C18 : 1omega9c) and summed feature 4 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1omega7c). Acid was not produced from d-glucose, and gelatin was not hydrolysed by the isolate. Genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data from this study indicate that the isolate should be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Acinetobacter. The name Acinetobacter harbinensis sp. nov. is proposed for the novel species, with HITLi 7T (=CGMCC 1.12528T=KCTC 32411T) as the type strain.
TI  - Contrasting effects of ultraviolet radiation on the growth efficiency of freshwater bacteria.
AB  - In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the growth efficiency of freshwater  bacteria is differentially affected by ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm) as mediated through changes in their production and respiration rates. Five bacterial strains affiliated to Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were isolated from different freshwater habitats and exposed in the laboratory to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and PAR + UVR, or kept in the dark for 4 h. Afterward, bacterial carbon production and respiration were assessed by measuring leucine incorporation and oxygen consumption rates, respectively. Ultraviolet radiation decreased significantly the bacterial production of Acidovorax sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Actinobacterium MHWTa3, and the respiration rate of Acidovorax sp. and Acinetobacter lwoffii. Measurements of respiration of a natural bacterial community collected from the same lake where A. lwoffii was isolated resulted in significantly higher rates after exposure to PAR + UVR than in the dark. In the presence of UVR, bacterial growth efficiency significantly decreased in Acidovorax sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Actinobacterium MHWTa3, but it increased in A. lwoffii or it remained unchanged in Sphingomonas sp. Our results indicate that although the outcome was strain-specific, UVR has the potential to alter the efficiency by which dissolved organic matter is transformed into bacterial biomass and thus to affect the biogeochemical carbon cycle.
TI  - Species identification and molecular characterization of Acinetobacter spp. blood culture isolates from Norway.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study investigated the species distribution, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and genotypic resistance characteristics of 113 consecutive blood culture isolates of Acinetobacter species collected between 2005 and 2007 throughout Norway. METHODS: Species identification was performed by partial rpoB sequence analysis, and verified by 16S rDNA and recA sequence analyses. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar disc diffusion and Etest. Distribution of OXA carbapenemase genes and epidemic clonality of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were detected by PCR assays. Analyses of blaOXA-51-like variants and quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were done by sequencing. RESULTS: The most prevalent species in the collection were Acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 13TU (46.9%) and Acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 (19.5%), followed by A. baumannii (8.8%) and Acinetobacter lwoffii/Acinetobacter gen. sp. 9 (7.1%). Carbapenem resistance was observed in one blaOXA-23-like-positive A. baumannii isolate. Quinolone resistance was detected in five isolates from the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex, of which two had point mutations in the QRDRs, including one novel ParC mutation. None of the A. baumannii isolates belonged to European/international clones I, II or III. Six blaOXA-51-like variants, including two novel variants, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter gen. sp. 13TU and Acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 were predominant in Norwegian blood cultures, in contrast to in other countries where A. baumannii has dominated. The study demonstrated the importance of genotypic identification to determine the exact epidemiology of non-baumannii Acinetobacter species.
TI  - Structure of the O-polysaccharide of Acinetobacter sp. VS-15 and Acinetobacter lwoffii EK67.
AB  - An O-polysaccharide was released by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide of Acinetobacter sp. VS-15 and studied by chemical methods along with (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D (1)H,(1)H COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, (1)H,(13)C HSQC and HMBC experiments. The following structure of the pentasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was established: [Formula: see text]. The O-polysaccharide of Acinetobacter lwoffii EK67 was found to have the same structure.
TI  - Assessment of 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic diversity and promising plant growth-promoting traits of Acinetobacter community from the rhizosphere of wheat.
AB  - Strains belonging to the genus Acinetobacter and their plant growth-promoting properties have been reported in the literature. However, there is a paucity of information on the diversity of Acinetobacter species associated with the wheat rhizosphere. In the present investigation, Acinetobacter species diversity was assessed in the rhizosphere of wheat from three agricultural fields where different varieties were cultivated. The Acinetobacter species diversity was assessed by DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) of 16S rRNA gene PCR products amplified from total soil DNA using genus-specific primers. Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii, Ac. lwoffii, Ac. baylyi and Acinetobacter sp. were detected in the rhizosphere of wheat. Prevalence of Acinetobacter species in the rhizosphere of wheat was also investigated by a cultivation-dependent approach. Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii, Ac. lwoffii and Acinetobacter sp. were isolated on selective media from the same samples. In vitro characterization of Acinetobacter isolates revealed that majority of these bacteria exhibited plant growth-promoting traits such as nitrogen fixation, siderophore production and mineral solubilization. These Acinetobacter strains may play a favorable role in plant growth promotion while residing in the rhizosphere of wheat.
TI  - Endemic and epidemic acinetobacter species in a university hospital: an 8-year survey.
AB  - The prevalence of the currently known Acinetobacter species and related trends of antimicrobial resistance in a Dutch university hospital were studied. Between 1999 and 2006, Acinetobacter isolates from clinical samples were collected prospectively. Isolates were analyzed by amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting. For species identification, a profile similarity cutoff level of 50% was used, and for strain identification, a cutoff level of 90% was used. Susceptibility for antimicrobial agents was tested by disk diffusion by following the CLSI guideline. The incidences of Acinetobacter isolates ranged from 1.7 to 3.7 per 10,000 patients per year, without a trend of increase, during the study years. Twenty different species were distinguished. Acinetobacter baumannii (27%) and Acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 (26%) were the most prevalent. Other species seen relatively frequently were Acinetobacter lwoffii (11%), Acinetobacter ursingii (4%), Acinetobacter johnsonii (4%), and Acinetobacter junii (3%). One large cluster of A. baumannii, involving 31 patients, and 16 smaller clusters of various species, involving in total 39 patients, with at most 5 patients in 1 cluster, occurred. Overall, 37% of the A. baumannii isolates were fully susceptible to the tested antibiotics. There was a borderline significant (P = 0.059) trend of decreasing susceptibility. A. baumannii was the Acinetobacter species causing the largest burden of multiple-antibiotic resistance and transmissions in the hospital.
TI  - Validation of partial rpoB gene sequence analysis for the identification of clinically important and emerging Acinetobacter species.
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the genus Acinetobacter are ubiquitous in soil and water. Only a few species, including Acinetobacter baumannii, and the unnamed Acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 and 13TU, which together with the soil organism Acinetobacter calcoaceticus are combined in the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii (Acb) complex, have been recognized as important nosocomial infectious agents. The ecology, epidemiology and pathology of most species are not yet well established. Lack of practical and accurate methods limits routine identification of clinical isolates and thus hampers precise identification of those of the Acb complex and other Acinetobacter species of possible clinical significance. We previously identified a 350 bp highly variable zone on the rpoB gene which appeared to be a promising target for rapid molecular identification. In the present study, we validated this method for accuracy on a collection of reference strains belonging to A. calcoaceticus (5 strains), Acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 (29 strains), A. gen. sp. 13TU (18 strains), A. baumannii (30 strains) and one strain each of A. radioresistens, A. gen. sp. 15TU, A. gen. sp. 10, A. gen. sp. 11, A. gen. sp. 'between 1 and 3' and A. gen. sp. 14TU=13BJ. This represents the largest analysis to date that compares a large number of well-identified strains of the Acb complex to assess the intra- and interspecies variation within this complex. All were correctly identified with 98.9-100 % intraspecies relatedness based on partial rpoB sequence analysis. We then applied this tool to identify 99 Acinetobacter clinical isolates from four public hospitals in Marseille, France. All isolates could easily be identified to species as they were separated into 13 species sequence types with a sequence variance of 0-2.6% from their respective type strains. Of these 99 isolates, 10 were A. haemolyticus, 52 were A. baumannii, 27 were A. gen. sp. 3, 5 were A. schindleri, 1 was A. lwoffii, and 1 was A. gen. sp. 13TU. Three were provisionally identified as A. gen. sp. 9. This is the first work to identify all specimens of a set of clinical Acinetobacter isolates at species level using rpoB sequence analysis. Our data emphasize the recognition of A. schindleri as an emerging cause of Acinetobacter-related infection and confirm that A. gen. sp. 3 is the second most commonly isolated Acinetobacter species after A. baumannii in patients.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a psychrotrophic Acinetobacter sp. CR9 and characterization of its alkaline lipase.
AB  - Forty three psychrotrophic bacteria were isolated from soil samples collected from Chandra river in sub-alpine region of western Himalaya, India. Among these, 11 isolates were found positive for lipase production at low temperature. Of 11 isolates, CR9 produced largest zone of clearance on plate assay and was able to produce lipase under wide range of pH. The isolate CR9 was identified as Acinetobacter sp. based on morphological and physiochemical characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. According to 16S rRNA gene sequencing data the closest phylogenetic neighbor for strain CR9 was Acinetobacter lwoffii (98.9%). The partially purified lipase from strain CR9 exhibited maximum activity at temperature 40 degrees C and pH optima at 8.0. Cu(2+), Mo(2+), Mg(2+), Zn(2+), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT) and beta-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) enhanced the enzyme activity, whereas Ca(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) had inhibitory effect. Lipase hydrolyzed wide range of short chain fatty acid esters of p-nitrophenyl. The organism CR9 also hydrolyzed tributyrin, Tween 80, soybean oil, mustard oil and olive oil. The results highlight the relevance of unexplored microbes from cold environments of western Himalaya for the isolation of novel lipase producing bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of random-donor platelets in a university hospital in the midwestern region of Brazil.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial blood contamination was probably the first recognized transfusion-transmitted disease. Although the transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis has been known for a long time, it remains an important health problem. At present it is the most frequently reported cause of infectious transfusion-related fatalities. The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of microbiologic contamination in random-donor platelets (RDPs) and to identify the isolated microorganism obtained from a Brazilian university hemotherapy service. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2000 RDPs were analyzed from November 2004 to June 2005. The time of storage of the platelet (PLT) concentrates studied ranged from the day of donation (Day 0) to the fifth day of storage (Day 5). The RDP cultures were initially performed in pools with bottles containing brain heart infusion (BHI) growth medium, and cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for up to 7 days and subcultured onto chocolate agar at 37 degrees C for 48 hours under conditions of microaerophilia. In the cases of positivity of one pool, the culture was individually performed for all the samples of that pool. RESULTS: Eight units (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.49) were found to be contaminated. Isolated microorganisms were three Acinetobacter lwoffii, one Enterobacter intermedium, one Serratia phymuthica, one Staphylococcus haemolyticus, one Staphylococcus hominis, and one Bacillus sp. CONCLUSION: PLT concentrates were contaminated with bacteria in 0.4 percent of tested units, which represents a potential risk to patients and a public health problem. Regarding the contaminant microorganisms, a predominance of Gram-negative agents was observed (62.5%).
TI  - Biodegradation of phthalate isomers by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PP4, Pseudomonas sp. PPD and Acinetobacter lwoffii ISP4.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa PP4, Pseudomonas sp. PPD and Acinetobacter lwoffii ISP4 capable of utilizing phthalate isomers were isolated from the soil using enrichment culture technique. The strain ISP4 metabolizes isophthalate, while PPD and PP4 utilizes all three phthalate isomers (ortho-, iso- and tere-) as the sole carbon source. ISP4 utilizes isophthalate (0.1%) more rapidly (doubling time, 0.9 h) compared to PPD (4.64 h), PP4 (7.91 h) and other reported strains so far. The metabolic pathways in these isolates were initiated by dihydroxylation of phthalate isomers. Phthalate is hydroxylated to 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxyphthalate and 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxyphthalate in strains PP4 and PPD, respectively; while terephthalate is hydroxylated to 2-hydro-1,2-dihydroxyterephthalate. All three strains hydroxylate isophthalate to 4-hydro-3,4-dihydroxyisophthalate. The generated dihydroxyphthalates were subsequently metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-DHB) which was further metabolized by ortho ring-cleavage pathway. PP4 and PPD cells grown on phthalate, isophthalate or terephthalate showed respiration on respective phthalate isomer and the activity of corresponding ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase, suggesting the carbon source specific induction of three different ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. We report, for the first time, the activity of isophthalate dioxygenase and its reductase component in the cell-free extracts. The enzyme showed maximum activity with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the pH range 8-8.5. Cells grown on glucose failed to respire on phthalate isomers and 3,4-DHB and showed significantly low activities of the enzymes suggesting that the enzymes are inducible.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence and overexpression of cat1 gene cluster, and roles of the putative transcriptional activator CatR1 in Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 capable of aniline degradation.
AB  - The aniline-assimilating bacterium Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 has two cat gene clusters (cat1 and cat2). In this study, we completely sequenced 10-kb DNA fragment of cat1 genes of A. lwoffii K24, which had been cloned in plasmid pCD1-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the order of genes in the cat1 operon-containing gene cluster was ORF porin, catR1, catB1C1A1D, ORF1, and ORF2. Two ORFs located immediately downstream catD were most similar with two ORFs in cat gene cluster of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 but the gene structure of catR1B1C1A1 was closest to that found in Frateurua sp. ANA-18 or Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. CatA1 gene product was significantly overexpressed and detected in SDS-PAGE when four cat1 genes (catB1C1A1D) were placed under the control of a lac promoter in pUC118 while overexpressions of other cat genes were accomplished under the control of a lac promoter in pET vector system. All gene products were verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Gel retardation assay revealed that the putative regulatory gene activator CatR1 for the catB1C1A1 operon could bind the promoter region of catB2 as well as catB1, suggesting that transcription of catB1 or catB2 might be controlled by the putative gene activator CatR1. However, the promoter regions of catA1 and catA2 were found to have no affinity with catR1.
TI  - Cerebrospinal meningitis with the presence of Acinetobacter spp.
AB  - The study was conducted on 16 strains of Acinetobacter sp. which were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnostic material was analysed with the use of automatic BacT/Alert system (Organon Teknika). The analysis was performed in the Department of Microbiology, Medical University in Bydgoszcz. API 20NE system (bioMerieux) enabled the identification of 14 strains (87.5%) as A. baumannii, 1 strain as A. haemolyticus and 1 strain as A. lwoffii. The micro-organisms were isolated from patients whose age ranged between 4 and 66 years. These patients were treated in the departments of Neurosurgery (75.0%), Neurology (18.8%) and Intensive Therapy (6.2%). The infection of cerebrospinal fluid was caused by injury and subsequent exposure to the bacteria present in external environment. Antibiotic-sensitivity of these micro-organisms was evaluated with the help of disc-diffusion method, observing standardisation conditions outlined by NCCLS. All the strains proved sensitive to carbapenems, 15 strains were sensitive to netilmicin, 7 strains--to tobramycin and 7 strains--to amikacin. All the strains displayed multiple resistance. The only exception was A. haemolyticus. The use of two-discs allowed for the detection of ESBLs in 7 A. baumannii strains. Positive results were most frequently obtained after the combination of sublactam and aztreonam. Due to microscopic resemblance between Acinetobacter spp., and bacteria of Neisseria, Moraxella and Haemophilus genus, microbiological diagnostics should not be restricted to microscopic assessment of cerebrospinal fluid and quick serological tests evaluating the antigens of the most frequent aetiological factors. Considering multiple resistance of Acinetobacter spp. to antibiotics, the treatment should be based on sensitivity tests and the ability of a given antibiotic to penetrate into cerebrospinal fluid. In our opinion, both reasonable antibiotic policy as well as observing the principles of hygiene and monitoring infections play equally important roles in the prevention of infections with Acinetobacter spp. Such combined measures may help to prevent the spreading of multiple resistant strains in hospital environment.
TI  - [Comparative evaluation of bacteria identification from the Acinetobacter genus using a commercially available API 20NE system, PCR and RFLP techniques].
AB  - A study was carried out for identification of 50 Acinetobacter strains isolated from various clinical materials. Using classic methods the following species were identifies: Acinetobacter sp. (68%), Acinetobacter baumanii (24%) and Acinetobacter lwofii (8%). In all strains the recA gene was found of 435-500 pz size which confirms their belonging to that genus. Amplification products were digested with restriction enzymes Mbol and HinfI (RFLP) and their detection was carried out on agarose gel by electrophoresis methods, owing to that the arrangement of gene fragment characteristic of each strain was obtained. After careful analysis restriction patterns were obtained corresponding to the following genome species: Acinetobacter baumanii (60%), Acinetobacter sp. 3 (28%) and Acinetobacter lwoffii (12%). The methods of molecular biology made possible a more precise classification of the studied strains according to species. Certain strains determined as Acinetobacter sp. by the API 20NE system were found to be Acinetobacter baumanii, Acinetobacter sp. 3 or Acinetobacter lwofii when determined by the PCR/RFLP method.
TI  - Biotyping of Acinetobacter species isolated from clinical samples.
AB  - We used the biotyping scheme using carbohydrate substrate utilization test with 14 carbon sources to speciate Acinetobacter isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures of patients admitted to the postoperative neurosurgery ICU during January to November 1996. Sixty one patients culture positive for Acinetobacter sp. from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were followed up prospectively. Among these patients, 40 patients had clinically diagnosed infections like bacteriemia or meningitis while in 21 patients the isolation was regarded as contaminants. A. baumanniii was the most common isolate associated with clinical infections while A. lwoffii was more likely to be an environmental contaminant.
TI  - Oil-degrading Acinetobacter strain RAG-1 and strains described as 'Acinetobacter  venetianus sp. nov.' belong to the same genomic species.
AB  - Acinetobacter strain RAG-1 (ATCC 31012) is an industrially important strain which has been extensively characterized with respect to its growth an hydrocarbons and its production of a high molecular mass bioemulsifier, emulsan. Although RAG-1 has been investigated in detail for specific biochemical characteristics, its taxonomic status is uncertain and it is usually referred to as A. lwoffii or A. calcoaceticus sensu lato. However, results obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified rDNA and subsequently substantiated by DNA-DNA hybridization, partial 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence comparison and biochemical characterization indicate that RAG-1 belongs to the genomic species recently described as 'A. venetianus'. Furthermore, these data confirm that 'A. venetianus' constitutes a new and distinct genomic species within the genus Acinetobacter.
TI  - [Susceptibility to antibiotics and biochemical activity of strains of Acinetobacter sp. isolated from various sources].
AB  - The study was performed on 576 Acinetobacter strains isolated from clinical material, objects from hospital, environment, soil, water and from animals. Applying API 20NE system identification was following: A. baumanii (61.1%), A. junii (19.4%), A. haemolyticus (4.3%), A. lwoffii (3.3%), A. johnsonii (0.52%) and not belonging to above genus strains (11.3%). Over 47% strains of Acinetobacter were isolated from clinical material as the only bacteria (mainly from samples received from intensive care units and surgical and urological wards). Out of 23 antibiotics and antimicrobials used for investigation of 535 strains of Acinetobacter, most active were imipenem (99%) of susceptible strains, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (95%) and netilmicin (88%). Multiple resistant strains were isolated more frequently from hospital environment than from other sources--these were mostly A. baumanii and A. junii.
TI  - [Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain with a wide spectrum of utilizing aromatic compounds and carrying a plasmid for resorcin degradation].
AB  - A bacterial strain was isolated from soil and identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. lwoffii. The strain can utilize a wide spectrum of aromatic compounds. It carries a transmissive plasmid pBSW13 which determines resorcin utilization via the ortho pathway including the following steps: resorcin-hydroxyhydroquinone-maleylacetate-beta-ketoadipi c acid. The plasmid has been transferred by conjugation into the recipient strains of A. calcoaceticus 5734 CCM rifr, Escherichia coli J-53 met-pro-rifr and Klebsiella sp. Plasmid DNA with a molecular mass close to that of phage gamma was detected by electrophoresis in the donor and recombinant strains. The degradation of other substrates is not a phenotypic expression of the genes of this plasmid.
