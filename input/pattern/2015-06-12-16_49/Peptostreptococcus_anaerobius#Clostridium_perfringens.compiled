TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of Angelica archangelica L.  (Apiaceae) roots.
AB  - In this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Angelica archangelica L. (Apiaceae) roots from central Italy were analyzed. The major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). The oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. A weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with MIC values >4.0% v/v.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa (Apiaceae) from Italy.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa L. (Apiaceae) from central Italy were analyzed by GC/MS. The major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). The two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Candida albicans with MIC values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. A less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with MIC values higher than 4.0%, v/v.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin (LY333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against Clostridium perfringens, Propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of Gram-positive anaerobes. MIC(90)s (microg/mL) for oritavancin were as follows: Clostridium perfringens 1.0, Propionibacterium acnes 0.25, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, Finegoldia magna 0.25, Micromonas. micros 0.25, and Anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. On a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. The oritavancin MICs are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. Oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing Gram-positive anaerobes such as these.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in New Zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. This study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in New Zealand. METHODS: Clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. Susceptibility was determined using NCCLS criteria. The change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the MIC. RESULTS: A total of 364 anaerobes were tested. Penicillin had poor activity against Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Eubacterium spp., Clostridium tertium and Veillonella spp. In general, Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides ureolyticus, Propionibacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. Amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with Bacteroides fragilis group and P. anaerobius isolates. Cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-B. fragilis species, Eubacterium spp. and P. anaerobius. Meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of Bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. With the exception of Propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. There has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. No clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.
TI  - [Comparison of the detection of anaerobic bacteria in haemoculture systems BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F, BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic and BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic].
AB  - The purpose of this study is to deal with the problem of anaerobic cultivation of clinical specimens and consider the possibility of using semi-automated blood culture instruments. The Bactec Lytic, BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic and BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic bottles were inoculated with Bacteriodes fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Feingoldia magna strains. The times to detection (TTD) for positive bottles were evaluated with reference to the number of inoculated bacteria. Inoculation with the same suspension of equal bacterial strain resulted in shorter TTD values for all the Bactec Lytic bottles as compared with the BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic or BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic bottles, respectively. Statistically significant differences were recorded (p=0,05) by Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens species. Feingoldia magna was submitted to culture in the Bactec Lytic alone. The anaerobic blood culture bottles are deemed acceptable for application in the culture of anaerobc isolates drawn from other samples except for blood (namely when prompt delivery of the sample to the laboratory is impossible and the sample can suffer damage), however, only a limited range of microorganisms can be taken into account for the detection purposes. The Bactec Lytic bottles are more appropriately designed for the detection of anaerobic bacterial species compared to the BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic and BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic bottles. They achieve faster growth parametres and provide more successful readings of anaerobic bacteria culture and detection.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Comparative activity of eighteen antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria  isolated in South Africa.
AB  - The in vitro activity of 18 antimicrobial agents was determined against 378 anaerobic bacteria isolated in Bloemfontein, South Africa, during 1996/97. Against the gram-positive isolates, MICs of penicillin and cefoxitin were >0.5 microg/ml and >16 microg/ml, respectively, for five and three strains of non-perfringens Clostridium spp. Seventeen Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains were resistant to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 microg/ml). All gram-positive anaerobes tested except one Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium sp. were susceptible to dalfopristin-quinupristin (MICs < or = 1 microg/ml). The carbapenems exhibited excellent activity against the gram-positive isolates and were effective against most gram-negative anaerobes, with the exception of the fusobacteria. Only seven strains exhibited decreased susceptibility to trovafloxacin (MICs > 2 microg/ml). In mixed anaerobic/aerobic infections, carbapenems and the fourth-generation quinolone trovafloxacin were the agents most suitable for us as broad-spectrum monotherapy.
TI  - Comparative anti-anaerobic activity of Men 10700, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Men 10700, a new penem, has been compared with that of metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, imipenem and three third generation cephalosporins against 120 strains of anaerobes. The organisms tested comprised Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis and speciated members of the genera Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Peptostreptococcus. Men 10700 showed activity similar to that of imipenem, and was more potent than metronidazole against all species except C. difficile and P. anaerobius. The spectrum of activity of Men 10700 suggests this agent may be useful for treating infections caused by anaerobes.
TI  - In-vitro antibiotic susceptibility and molecular analysis of anaerobic bacteria isolated in Cape Town, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and twenty-three anaerobic isolates from Cape Town, South Africa, were tested in vitro against cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, co-amoxiclav, benzylpenicillin and clindamycin. Forty-five Gram-positive organisms were tested against RP59500 (a streptogramin). Resistance in the Gram-positive isolates was as follows: of the Clostridium perfringens isolates, 4% were resistant to benzylpenicillin and 4% to clindamycin; of the Peptostreptococcus anaerobius isolates, 10% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, 10% to cefoxitin and 10% to metronidazole; of the isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp., 12% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, 6% to metronidazole, 6% to chloramphenicol and 12% to RP59500. Of the Gram-negative organisms, those in the Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to benzylpenicillin (83%), cefoxitin (5%), clindamycin (5%) and co-amoxiclav (2%). One clindamycin-resistant B. fragilis isolate carried a plasmid homologous to the ermF erythromycin resistance determinant.
TI  - Emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in South Korea.
AB  - In previous studies, Bacteroides fragilis group organisms isolated from Korean patients were more frequently resistant to various antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, than were isolates in other countries. A recent report of increased resistance of Peptostreptococcus species prompted us to include such isolates in a study of antimicrobial susceptibility. anaerobes isolated in 1994 at a tertiary care hospital in Seoul were tested by agar dilution method. None of the B. fragilis group organisms were resistant to imipenem, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole. However, 6.7% were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, 20.2% to cefotetan, 30.3% to piperacillin, 48.3% to cefotaxime, and 42.7% to clindamycin. Almost all of the Clostridium perfringens isolates were susceptible to all of the agents tested, except tetracycline. Peptostreptococcus isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem, while 7.4% were resistant to penicillin G, cefotetan, and metronidazole, and 25.9% were resistant to clindamycin. The isolates resistant to penicillin G, cefotetan, and metronidazole were identified as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. In conclusion, besides the well-known high rate of resistance of B. fragilis group organisms to clindamycin, the emergence of resistance of Peptostreptococcus species isolates to beta-lactam drugs has become obvious in Korea.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of anaerobic cocci and proposal of Ruminococcus hansenii comb. nov. and Ruminococcus productus comb. nov.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of representative members of the family Peptococcaceae were determined. The members of the family examined were divided into the following four phylogenetic groups: Peptococcus niger ATCC 27731T (T = type strain), the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group, the ruminococcus-coprococcus group, and the peptostreptococcus group. Peptococcus niger, the type species of the family, was not related to other members of the family. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337T, the type strain of the type species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to Clostridium sordellii NCIB 10717T (level of sequence similarity, 85%). Sarcina ventriculi GIFU 7886, a spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive coccus, clustered with Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124T at a similarity value of 91%. Members of the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group clustered with clostridia at similarity values ranging from 85 to 91%. The type strains of Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus magnus clustered at levels of sequence homology of 84 to 93%. This cluster was not included in the Peptococcus niger group or the Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group. Thus, these members of the genus Peptostreptococcus should be separated from the other members of the genus and also from members of the family Peptococcaceae. The sequence of Peptostreptococcus productus ATCC 27340T was different from the sequences of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus niger. The sequence of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T, a strictly anaerobic strain, was different from the sequences of other streptococci; this strain clustered with Peptostreptococcus productus, coprococci, and ruminococci. Several phenotypic characteristics of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T were similar to characteristics of ruminococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Obligately anaerobic bacterial species isolated from foot-rot lesions in goats.
AB  - Lesions showing clinical signs of foot-rot from 120 goats were cultured on six selective media during October 1987 to November 1988. A total of 582 strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to 50 different species was isolated and identified. The anaerobes most frequently isolated belonged to the following genera: Bacteroides (80%), Peptostreptococcus (63.6%), Megasphaera (40%), Fusobacterium (29.2%), Clostridium (22.5%), Propionibacterium (12.5%), Eubacterium (11.7%) and Leptotrichia (10.8%). Percentages for Acidaminococcus, Peptococcus, Tissierella, Wolinella and Veillonella were below 10%. The following species were identified in 10% or more of cases: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (61.7%), Bacteroides buccae (51.7%), Bacteroides nodosus (42.5%), Megasphaera elsdenii (40%), Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis (22.5%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (19.2%), Leptotrichia buccalis (11.7%) and Clostridium perfringens (10%). Lower percentages were obtained for the remaining species. The efficiency and selectivity of the six culture media used for isolation are discussed.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin G against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  - Treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic infection site in rabbits. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a mean of 5.3 log10 CFU/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. Antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin G (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. With the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. Antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. At the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 CFU/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against B. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. The addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited B. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated B. fragilis in vivo. In vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - Occurrence of anaerobic bacteria in diseases of the dog and cat.
AB  - A survey for anaerobic bacteria was conducted in 314 clinical specimens from dogs and cats. A total of 187 anaerobic isolates in pure and mixed culture were isolated from 111 of the specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria. Common isolated included Actinomyces (9.1%), Clostridium perfringens (19.3%), other Clostridium spp (11.2%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (7.5%), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (13.4%), other Bacteroides spp (17.6%), and Fusobacterium necrophorum (5.3%). Anaerobic bacteria were involved in serious lesions that often were life threatening to the animals. Antibiotic susceptibility data indicated that the lincomycin family, the penicillin family, chloramphenicol, and cephaloridine are preferred drugs for treatment of anaerobic infections. Data from the survey were used in formulation of a table to aid practitioners in clinical diagnosis of disease caused by anaerobes. Clostridium perfringens was isolated in large numbers from five of six dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and from one cat with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Experimental infections were induced in rats, using caine feces as inoculum. Induced lesions contained aerobic and anaerobic bacteria similar to those bacteria isolated in the clinical survey, indicating that feces may serve as a major source of these bacteria in clinical infections of the dog.
TI  - Factors related to the oxygen tolerance of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of atmospheric oxygen on the viability of 13 strains of anaerobic bacteria, two strains of facultative bacteria, and one aerobic organism was examined. There were great variations in oxygen tolerance among the bacteria. All facultative bacteria survived more than 72 h of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. The survival time for anaerobes ranged from less than 45 min for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius to more than 72 h for two Clostridium perfringens strains. An effort was made to relate the degree of oxygen tolerance to the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases in cell-free extracts of the bacteria. All facultative bacteria and a number of anaerobic bacteria possessed superoxide dismutase. There was a correlation between superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen tolerance, but there were notable exceptions. Polyacrylamide gel electropherograms stained for superoxide dismutase indicated that many of the anaerobic bacteria contained at least two electrophoretically distinct enzymes with superoxide dismutase activity. All facultative bacteria contained peroxidase, whereas none of the anaerobic bacteria possessed measurable amounts of this enzyme. Catalase activity was variable among the bacteria and showed no relationship to oxygen tolerance. The ability of the bacteria to reduce oxygen was also examined and related to enzyme content and oxygen tolerance. In general, organisms that survived for relatively long periods of time in the presence of oxygen but demonstrated little superoxide dismutase activity reduced little oxygen. The effects of medium composition and conditions of growth were examined for their influence on the level of the three enzymes. Bacteria grown on the surface of an enriched blood agar medium generally had more enzyme activity than bacteria grown in a liquid medium. The data indicate that superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen reduction rates are important determinants related to the tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in hospital practice.
AB  - The role of anaerobes in the pathogenesis of infections was investigated. Anaerobes were isolated from 0,25% of blood cultures and from 15,8% of other specimens tested; in 15,1% of cases where anaerobes were isolated, no aerobes were found. The strains most commonly encountered were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium perfringens. Sensitivity tests in vitro showed all organisms to be sensitive to clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol, while a large proportion were resistant to penicillin G and smaller numbers were resistant to tetracycline.
TI  - Extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The production of extracellular deoxyribonuclease was examined with anaerobic organisms isolated from clinical specimens. Nuclease activity was extraordinarily common. All strains of Fusobacterium, including eight species, as well as Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus, displayed enzyme activity. Whereas the gram-positive bacteria were generally less productive, all strains of Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus intermedius, and P. anaerobius specifically produced deoxyribonuclease. The test is taxonomically valuable, particularly in the characterization of gram-positive cocci, since a deoxyribonuclease-producing coccus indicates P. intermedius or P. anaerobius. Additionally, possession of the enzyme may prove to be a useful correlate of the potential pathogenicity of anaerobes.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
