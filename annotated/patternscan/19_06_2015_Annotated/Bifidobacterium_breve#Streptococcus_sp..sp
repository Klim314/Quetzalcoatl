TI  == fermented infant formula increases ileal protein digestibility and reduces ileal  proteolytic activity compared with standard and hydrolyzed infant formula in piglets.
AB  == background: an infant formula that contained milk fermented by the bacteria bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus (lactofidus) was reported to alleviate functional digestive symptoms in infants. it was hypothesized that improved protein digestibility of the fermented infant formula could contribute to this effect. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protein digestibility of a specific fermented (ff), standard (sf), and an extensively hydrolyzed protein (hf) formula. methods: four-week-old piglets (n = 7) were fitted with a t-cannula at the terminal ileum and received each formula in a latin square design. ff, sf, and hf contained 11.7%, 9.3%, and 11.9% (w/w) crude  protein; 1.5%, 5.4%, and 5.6% (w/w) fiber; and had a casein/whey ratio of 60:40,  50:50, and 0:100 per kilogram of powder, respectively. ileal digesta were collected and analyzed for amino acids and proteolytic activity. results: ff had  a significantly higher apparent ileal crude protein digestibility (92.1% +/- 1.0%) than sf and hf (84.4% +/- 1.0% and 83.9% +/- 0.9%, respectively). ff also had a significantly higher dry matter digestibility than sf and hf. the ileal crude protein flow of ff was significantly lower than that of sf and hf. the ileal flow of ff of total proteolytic activity was significantly lower than that  of sf but not significantly different from that of hf (412 +/- 163 ku/8 h vs. 1530 +/- 163 and 703 +/- 156 ku/8 h, respectively). conclusions: the ff in piglets had a significantly higher apparent ileal crude protein digestibility than the sf and the hf and displayed lower ileal proteolytic activity than sf. both effects may contribute to the alleviation of functional gastrointestinal symptoms reported in infants fed fermented infant milk formula.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  == purpose of review: in the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. recent findings: studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. there is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of  the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. however, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. there are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, escherichia coli plus enterococcus faecalis in prosymbioflor and heat-killed bifidobacterium  breve and streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not  be reduced by these interventions. summary: during the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. there was only an effect on eczema in the prosymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using b. breve and s. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. however, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.

TI  == reduction of the enniatins a, a(1), b, b(1) by an in vitro degradation employing  different strains of probiotic bacteria: identification of degradation products by lc-ms-lit.
AB  == the degradation of the fusarium mycotoxins ens by 9 bacterial strains characteristic of the gastrointestinal tract like bb. longum, bb. bifidum, bb. breve, bb. adolescentes, lb. rhamnosus, lb. casei-casei, s. termofilus, lb. ruminis, lb. casei and twenty two strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. the fermentations were carried out in the liquid medium of de man rogosa sharpe (mrs) under anaerobic conditions for bifidobacteria streptococcus and lactobacillus, and in potato dextrose broth (pdb) for saccharomyces strains, during 48 h. the degradation of the bioactive compounds ens was also studied in a food system composed by wheat flour naturally contaminated by ens through fermentation by a strain of fusarium tricinctum. the determination of the ens in  the fermentation mediums was performed using the technique of the liquid chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometry detector in tandem (lc-ms/ms), whereas the identification of the degradation products produced by microbial fermentation was carried out using the technique of the lc coupled to the linear  ion trap (lit). all the bacteria analyzed in this study showed a significant ens  reduction in vitro during the fermentation processes, with degradation data ranging from 5 to the 99%. in the food system, the ens degradation data evidenced ranged from 1.3 to 49.2%. also three ens degradation products were identified.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == effect of functional yogurt ny-yp901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  == background/objectives: this study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt ny-yp901 (namyang dairy product co. ltd and nutra r&bt inc., seoul, korea) supplemented with mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing bifidobacterium breve (cbg-c2), enterococcus faecalis fk-23, fibersol-2 and so on. subjects/methods: this study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt ny-yp901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. body weight and body mass  index (bmi), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with hba1c and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. results: during the period august 2009 to december 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. in the treatment group consuming ny-yp901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, p<0.05), bmi (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), p<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, p<0.05) after 8 weeks. the change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. conclusions: the functional yogurt ny-yp901 reduced ldl-cholesterol, body weight and bmi in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. from these findings, regular intake of functional  yogurt ny-yp901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.

TI  == a fermented formula in pre-term infants: clinical tolerance, gut microbiota, down-regulation of faecal calprotectin and up-regulation of faecal secretory iga.
AB  == intestinal bacterial colonisation in pre-term infants is delayed compared with full-term infants, leading to an increased risk of gastrointestinal disease. modulation of colonisation through dietary supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics could decrease such a risk. the present study evaluated clinical tolerance, the effects on gut microbiota, and inflammatory and immunological mucosal responses to an infant formula adapted for pre-term infants that included in its manufacturing process a fermentation step with two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065, inactivated by heat at the end of the process. a total of fifty-eight infants (gestational age: 30-35 weeks), fed either the fermented pre-term formula or a standard pre-term formula, were followed up during their hospital stay. clinical tolerance, faecal microbiota using a culture and a culture-independent method (temporal temperature gel electrophoresis), faecal calprotectin and secretory iga were analysed weekly. no difference was observed regarding anthropometric data and digestive tolerance, except for abdominal distension, the incidence of which was lower in infants fed  the fermented formula for 2 weeks. bacterial colonisation was not modified by the type of feeding, particularly for bifidobacteria. faecal calprotectin was significantly lower in infants fed the fermented formula for 2 weeks, and secretory iga increased with both mother's milk and the fermented formula. the fermented formula was well tolerated and did not significantly modulate the bacterial colonisation but had benefits on inflammatory and immune markers, which might be related to some features of gastrointestinal tolerance.

TI  == a non-hydrolyzed, fermented milk formula reduces digestive and respiratory events in infants at high risk of allergy.
AB  == background/objectives: to determine the impact of a not hydrolyzed fermented infant formula containing heat-killed bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065 (hkbbst) on the incidence of allergy-like events during the first 2 years of life in children at high risk of atopy. subjects/methods: this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study included infants at high  risk of atopy. infants used hkbbst or a standard infant formula (sif) since birth until 1 year of age, and were followed at 4, 12 and 24 months after birth. skin prick tests (spts) for six foods and six aeroallergens were systematically performed and adverse events (aes) were recorded. in case of potentially allergic ae (paae), allergy could be further tested by spt, patch tests and quantification of specific iges. if cow's milk allergy (cma) was suspected, an oral challenge could also be performed. results: the study included 129 children, 63 were randomized to sif, 66 to hkbbst. the use of hkbbst milk did not alter the proportion of cma but decreased the proportion of positive spt to cow's milk (1.7 vs 12.5%, p=0.03), and the incidence of digestive (39 vs 63%, p=0.01) and respiratory potentially allergic aes (7 vs 21%, p=0.03) at 12 months, and that of respiratory paaes at 24 months (13 vs 35%, p=0.01). conclusions: hkbbst decreased the incidence of paaes in children with family history of atopy, during the first months of life and after the formula was stopped. oral tolerance to cow's milk in infants at high risk of atopy may therefore be improved using not hydrolyzed fermented formulae.

AB  == probiotics must be consumed at a level of 10(7) cfu/ml for successful colonization of the gut. in yogurts containing beneficial cultures, the survival  of probiotic strains can quickly decline below this critical concentration during cold storage. we hypothesized that beta-glucan would increase the viability of bifidobacteria strains in yogurt during cold storage. yogurts were produced containing 0.44% beta-glucan (concentrated or freeze-dried) extracted from whole  oat flour and/or 1.33% modified corn starch, and bifidobacteria (b. breve or b. longum) at a concentration of at least 10(9) cfu/ml. all yogurts were stored at 4 degrees c. bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbureckii subsp. bulgaricus, were enumerated from undisturbed aliquots before fermentation, after fermentation, and once a week for 5 wk. s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus maintained a concentration of at least 10(8) cfu/ml in yogurts containing concentrated or freeze-dried beta-glucan regardless  of starch addition, and in the control with no added beta-glucan or starch. similarly, the probiotic, bifidobacterium breve, survived above a therapeutic level in all treatments. the addition of beta-glucan prolonged the survival of bifidobacterium longum at a concentration of at least 10(7) cfu/ml by up to 2 wk  on average beyond the control. further, the inclusion of concentrated beta-glucan in yogurt improved survival of b. longum above 10(7) cfu/ml by 1 wk longer than did freeze-dried beta-glucan. study results suggest that beta-glucan has a protective effect on bifidobacteria in yogurt when stressed by low-temperature storage.

TI  == utilization of monolinolein as a substrate for conjugated linoleic acid production by bifidobacterium breve lmc 520 of human neonatal origin.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate bifidobacteria from human intestines that efficiently converts monolinolein, a monoglyceride form of linoleic acid, into conjugated linoleic acid (cla), as well as to optimize culture conditions for improving cla production during milk fermentation. among 150 screened neonatal bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium breve lmc 520 showed the highest cla-producing ability and was tested with different types of fat substrates at various concentrations to determine the optimal conditions for cla production. monolinolein was tested as a substrate for cla production. the incubation time optimized for cla production was 24 h, and cla production was proportionally increased with monolinolein concentration. the incubation of lmc 520 with commercial starter strains caused minimal reduction in cla production. our results demonstrate that the cla-producing ability of b. breve lmc 520 could offer beneficial effects when utilized as a starter culture for the development of functional dairy products.

TI  == potentially probiotic bacteria induce efficient maturation but differential cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  == aim: to analyze the ability of nine different potentially probiotic bacteria to induce maturation and cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modcs). methods: cytokine production and maturation of modcs in response to bacterial stimulation was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and flow cytometric analysis (facs), respectively. the kinetics of mrna expression of cytokine genes was determined by northern blotting. the involvement of different signaling pathways in cytokine gene expression was studied using specific pharmacological signaling inhibitors. results: all studied bacteria induced the maturation of modcs in a dose-dependent manner. more detailed analysis with s. thermophilus ths, b. breve bb99, and l. lactis subsp. cremoris arh74 indicated that these bacteria induced the expression of modc maturation markers hla class ii and cd86 as efficiently as pathogenic bacteria. however, these bacteria differed in their ability to induce modc cytokine gene expression. s. thermophilus induced the expression of pro-inflammatory (tnf-alpha, il-12, il-6, and ccl20) and th1 type (il-12 and ifn-gamma) cytokines, while b. breve and l. lactis were also potent inducers of anti-inflammatory il-10. mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38, phosphatidylinositol 3 (pi3) kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) signaling pathways were shown to be involved in bacteria-induced cytokine production. conclusion: our results indicate that potentially probiotic bacteria are able to induce modc maturation, but their ability to induce cytokine gene expression varies significantly from one bacterial strain to another.

TI  == in vitro inhibition activity of nisin a, nisin z, pediocin pa-1 and antibiotics against common intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the sensitivity of 21 common intestinal bacteria to six antibiotics and three broad-spectrum bacteriocins (nisins z and a and pediocin pa-1). methods and results: neutralized cell-free culture supernatants containing active bacteriocins, and antibiotics were tested with the agar diffusion test and the disc-diffusion method, respectively. the tested intestinal strains showed high sensitivity to most antibiotics except for streptomycin and oxacillin. nisins a and z (8 mug per well) had similar activity spectra and inhibited all gram-positive intestinal bacteria at different levels (except streptococcus salivarius), with bifidobacteria (except bifidobacterium breve and bif. catenulatum), collinsella aerofaciens and eubacterium biforme being the most sensitive strains, but they were not active against gram-negative bacteria. surprisingly, none of the tested strains were inhibited by pediocin pa-1 (16 mug  per well). conclusion: pediocin pa-1 which is very active against listeria spp. and other food pathogens did not inhibit major intestinal species in the human intestine in contrast to both nisins a and z. significance and impact of the study: our data suggest that pediocin pa-1 has potential to inhibit listeria within the intestinal microbiota without altering commensal bacteria.

AB  == to investigate the effects of fermented formula (ff) with bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065 on thymus size and stool ph of healthy term infants, ultrasound examinations and evaluations of thymus sizes and thymus  indices (ti) and measurements of stool ph were performed in the same 90 term neonates on the 3rd d of life and on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th mo of life. thirty newborns were exclusively breast-fed while the remaining 60 were randomly  assigned to receive either a ff or a standard formula (sf). the fecal ph of the breast-fed group was lower than the sf group (p < 0.05), although it was similar  to that of the ff group on the third postnatal day, persisting for the entire 4 mo of the study. the difference in ti was statistically significant over repeated measurements among the groups. the ff infants showed a ti similar to the breast-fed newborns. probiotic fermentation products have effects comparable to those of the bacteria composing the intestinal microflora supporting the idea that intestinal bacterial balance plays an important role in improving host immune responses.

TI  == stimulation of immunity without alteration of oral tolerance in mice fed with heat-treated fermented infant formula.
AB  == objectives: little information is available on the properties of fermented milk formula intended to healthy infants. this study analyzes the effect of long-term  ingestion of a heat-treated, fermented milk formula on the development of oral tolerance or systemic immune response to soluble antigens in mice. materials and  methods: the c3h/hen mice, fed with a heat-treated fermented (bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065) infant formula (htff) or a matched  control diet (control), were immunized with ovalbumin (ova) with or without gavage of 20 mg ova to induce tolerance or immunity, respectively. systemic and local anti-ova immune responses and intestinal barrier function were measured after 5 to 6 weeks. results: oral tolerance to ova developed similarly in htff- and control-fed mice, attested to by the downregulation of ova-specific immunoglobulin (ig) g and ige after oral ova administration. in contrast, immunization with ova led to significantly higher titers in htff-fed mice than in control-fed mice (log2 igg titers, 16.45 +/- 1.24 and 15.46 +/- 0.79, respectively; p = 0.012). jejunal interferon gamma, interleukin 12p40 and interleukin 10 expressions were significantly higher in tolerized mice fed with htff compared with those fed with the control diet. mucosal to serosal intact horseradish peroxidase fluxes were lower in htff-fed mice than in control-fed mice (39 +/- 8 and 118 +/- 38 ng/h x cm2, respectively; p < 0.0001), indicating that the htff diet reinforces intestinal barrier capacity to macromolecules. conclusions: in mice, htff strengthens intestinal barrier and enhances systemic immune responses to antigens without interfering with the development of oral tolerance, suggesting a potential beneficial effect in host defence and vaccination.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus secretion products enhance t helper 1 immune response and intestinal barrier in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria or their secretion products can modulate immune responses differently in normal and inflammatory conditions. this comparative study analyzes the effect of oral administration of living lactic acid bacteria, or their conditioned media, on the epithelial and immune functions of colitis-prone  c57bl/6 il-10-deficient mice. mice were untreated (control) or infected with helicobacter hepaticus with or without oral treatment with living bacteria, bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065 (lb), or their culture-conditioned media (cm). histology, cytokine mrna, electrical resistance,  and barrier capacity of colonic samples as well as cytokine secretion by mesenteric lymph node (mln) cells were studied. helicobacter hepaticus mice developed only mild colitis, which was not modified in lb or cm groups. in the cm (but not the lb) group, the colonic barrier was reinforced as compared to the other groups, as evidenced by decreased horseradish peroxidase (hrp) transcytosis and mannitol fluxes and increased electrical resistance. in mln, the percentage of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells secreting ifngamma was significantly higher in cm (2.06% and 1.98%, respectively) mice than in h. hepaticus (1.1% and 0.47%, p < 0.05) or  control mice. in addition, the nonspecific stimulation of ifngamma, tnfalpha, and il-12 secretion by mln cells was significantly higher in the cm group as compared to the other groups. in the absence of severe colitis, bifidobacterium breve c50- and streptococcus thermophilus 065-conditioned media can reinforce intestinal barrier capacity and stimulate th1 immune response, highlighting the involvement  of lactic acid bacteria-derived components in host defense.

TI  == effects of specific lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules and the inflammatory condition.
AB  == non-live probiotic bacteria and their fermentation products can be used in milk-based formula intended for healthy infants. the effects of a milk formula fermented with bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus and heated/dehydrated to inactivate the micro-organisms have been reported over the last few years to decrease the intestinal permeability to macromolecules in experimental animals in vivo and more recently to down-regulate inflammatory condition in vitro. feeding guinea-pigs with such dehydrated fermented milk reinforced the intestinal barrier resistance to food proteins (hrp, beta-lactoglobulin). in addition, the products secreted by bacteria were capable  of inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf-alpha secretion by human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. the active secretion products were resistant  to digestive enzymes and their anti-inflammatory properties were preserved after  transepithelial transport across the filter-grown intestinal epithelial cell line, especially in inflammatory conditions. the binding of lps to monocytes as well as nfkappab nuclear translocation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription were inhibited by bacteria-culture supernatants. conclusion: b. breve and s. thermophilus used as non-live micro-organisms in fermented infant formula seem to induce a reduction in macromolecular absorption and release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect, which persists after intestinal transport. thus, specific lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites seem to affect positively the intestinal function.

TI  == effects of long-term consumption of a fermented infant formula (with bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065) on acute diarrhea in healthy infants.
AB  == objective: to determine whether long-term consumption of a fermented infant formula could influence the incidence of acute diarrhea and its severity in healthy infants. method: nine hundred seventy-one infants, ranging in age from 4  to 6 months, were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial during a period of 5 months. they consumed daily either a fermented infant  formula (ff) (fermentation with bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065) or a standard infant formula (sf) of the same nutritional composition. evaluation criteria: number and duration of acute diarrhea episodes  were evaluated. severity of the episodes was determined by the number of hospital admissions, incidence of dehydration, number of medical consultations, number of  oral rehydration solution prescriptions, and number of formula switches. results: growth of the infants and acceptability of the formulas were identical in the two groups. incidence, duration of diarrhea episodes, and number of hospital admissions did not differ significantly between groups. episodes were less severe in the ff (fermented formula) group. there were fewer cases of dehydration 2.5%versus 6.1% (p = 0.01), fewer medical consultations (46%v 56.6%, p = 0.003),  fewer ors prescriptions 41.9%v 51.9% (p = 0.003) and fewer switches to other formulas (59.5%v 74.9%, p = 0.0001) in ff infants compared to sf. conclusion: a fermented formula may reduce the severity of acute diarrhea among healthy young infants. this outcome may be linked to the bifidogenic effects of fermentation products and their interactions with the intestinal immune system.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == use of chemical mutagenesis for the isolation of food grade beta-galactosidase overproducing mutants of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == a classical chemical mutagenesis protocol was evaluated for increasing beta-galactosidase production by probiotic bacteria to improve their potential to treat symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans. two bifidobacterium species (b. breve and b. longum) and one strain each of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were tested by a single exposure to two chemical mutagens, ethyl methanesulfonate (ems) and n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng). to screen for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) overproducing mutants, optimized ems and mnng mutant pots for each strain were plated on bhi agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (x-gal). colonies that exhibited a blue color were selected for quantitative beta-gal activities using the o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactoside (onpg) assay. seventy-five mutants were obtained out of more than 2 million colonies screened and showed increased beta-galactosidase activities compared with the wild-type strains. ems gave a higher frequency of beta-gal overproducing mutants than mnng for three of the four strains, s. thermophilus, b. breve, and b. longum, whereas the frequency of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus beta-gal mutants was similar with both mutagens. the highest beta-gal increases, when induced during growth in lactose, for mutants of each culture were 137% for l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus; 104% for s. thermophilus; 70% for b. breve; and 222% for b. longum mutants. this food-grade classical approach has the ability to moderately increase beta-gal concentrations in probiotic cultures to improve their potential for treating the symptoms of lactose malabsorption in humans.

AB  == background: the respective effect of milk and fermented milks on intestinal barrier capacity and on sensitization to beta-lactoglobulin was studied using a guinea pig model of cow's milk allergy. methods: guinea pigs were fed a control diet or the same diet supplemented with milk, fermented milk (streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium breve), or dehydrated fermented milk. intestinal barrier capacity to macromolecules was assessed in an ussing chamber, and sensitization to cow's milk proteins was measured by systemic anti-beta-lactoglobulin immunoglobulin g1 titers and by intestinal anaphylaxis, the latter assessed by the beta-lactoglobulin-induced increase in short-circuit current of jejunal fragments (deltaisc(beta-lg)). results: the electrical resistance of jejunum was similar in the four groups (approximately 80 omega/cm2) suggesting the same paracellular permeability. the transport of 14c-beta-lactoglobulin from mucosa to serosa was significantly decreased in the animals fed dehydrated fermented milk (403+/-131 ng / hr x cm2) compared with that in control animals or animals fed milk (767+/-250 ng / hr x cm2 and 749+/-475 ng / hr x cm2, respectively; p < 0.05). milk fermentation did not modify native beta-lactoglobulin concentration but anti-beta-lactoglobulin immunoglobulin g1 titers were higher in fermented milk and dehydrated fermented milk (log10 titer = 2.86 and 2.79, respectively) than in guinea pigs fed milk (log10 titer = 2.5; p < 0.007). however, beta-lactoglobulin-induced intestinal anaphylaxis remained the same in the three groups (deltaisc(beta-lg), 9.6+/-4.1 microa/cm2, 8.5+/-4.3 microa/cm2, and 8.5+/-3.4 microa/cm2 in milk-fed, fermented milk-fed, and dehydrated fermented milk-fed guinea pigs, respectively). conclusions: the intestinal barrier capacity to milk proteins seems to be reinforced by dehydrated fermented milk, but milk and fermented milks are equally efficient in inducing cow's milk allergy in guinea pigs.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == cell-free whey from milk fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  == the ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. in the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with bifidobacterium breve c50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with streptococcus thermophilus and b. breve c50 and given to 10 control subjects. nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk  indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. fecal excretion of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of b. breve whey. fecal ph was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with bif. breve.  fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. the results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to  modify intestinal flora of humans. repression of b. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans.  the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI  == [the influence of cefpodoxime proxetil on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cpdx-pr dry syrup was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of bacteria: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no notable changes were observed in fecal viable cell counts except that slight decreases of e. coli counts were observed on the days 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with infections, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 1 year 1 month to 6 years 10 months, with their body weights ranging from 9.3 to 23.8 kg. cpdx-pr dry syrup was administered at a dose between 3.0 to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although some variations of the  fecal bacterial flora were noticed between subjects during the administration of  cpdx-pr, no notable changes were observed in major aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium in 4 of the 5 cases. large decreases in streptococcus, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and anaerobic cocci and an increase in enterococcus  were observed in the other case. there was no case in which glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. regarding enterobacteriaceae, transitory bacterial replacement was observed within the genus. fecal concentration of cpdx during the administration of cpdx-pr was extremely low or below the detectable limit except one specimen from a case in which intestinal bacterial flora showed remarkable changes. from the above, cpdx-pr appears to be a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal  bacterial flora.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
