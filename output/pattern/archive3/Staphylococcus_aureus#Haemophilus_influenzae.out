pathogenic bacterial nasopharyngeal colonization and its impact on respiratory diseases in the first year of life: the patch birth cohort study.
background: for acute respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, colonization in the respiratory tracts is often the first sign, although nasopharynx is the major source of secretions containing pathogens. to understand the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases, it is important to analyze the establishment of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. methods: infants with nasopharyngeal swabs were examined at the age of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months for the detection of pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the methods used for detection were bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: from january 2012 to august 2013, a total of 320 neonates were enrolled, and 120 of them completed the first 12-month study. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen at all 5 time points while the rates declined; in contrast, the other 4 increased during the first year of life. of our series, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection rates were higher than those of bacterial culture. more than 50% of staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant, and the trend decreased in the same period. in the analysis of factors associated with the development of infant wheeze, infants with maternal atopy [odds ratio (or): 3.26; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.20-8.88; p = 0.02] and pneumococcal colonization (or: 15.64; 95% ci: 3.25-75.35; p = 0.001) had higher rates of wheeze. conclusions: bacterial interactions may result in differing pathogen prevalence in the first year of life. in addition, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may have an effect on the risk of infant wheeze. the result could help clinicians to clarify the relation between bacterial colonization and respiratory illnesses in infancy.
bacterial spectrum of spontaneously ruptured otitis media in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in germany.
otitis media is a common pediatric disease and the main reason for antibiotic prescription in children. before implementation of routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination in germany, serotypes contained in the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) were among the most frequent pneumococcal serotypes responsible for acute otitis media (aom). this report describes the first 3 years of a prospective, multicenter, epidemiological cross-sectional study examining the bacteriology of middle ear fluids (mef) and nasopharyngeal swabs (nps) of children 2 months to 5 years of age with spontaneously perforated aom in the era of routine pneumococcal vaccination. mef was obtained from 963 subjects; nps from 877. reported case numbers steeply decreased over the three study years even though the recruiting base remained the same. among subjects with relevant bacterial growth in their mef swabs, 113 (11.7%) had streptococcus pyogenes, 97 (10.1%) staphylococcus aureus, 88 (9.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae, 63 (6.5%) haemophilus influenzae, and 8 (0.8%) moraxella catarrhalis. s. pneumoniae isolates decreased from 41 (9.3%) in year 1 to 12 (5.7%) in year 3 (p = 0.128). pcv7 serotypes accounted for only 7.9% (n = 7) of isolated pneumococci. of the 877 subjects with nps cultures, 465 (53.0%) carried s. pneumoniae, 314 (35.8%) h. influenzae, 292 (33.3%) m. catarrhalis, and 110 (12.5%) s. pyogenes; 79.4% (n = 765) of the children were vaccinated with at least one dose of pcv. carriage of pneumococci was slightly lower in vaccinated (47.8%) than in unvaccinated (52.7%) children (p = 0.254). pcv7 serotypes were carried by 9.6% of unvaccinated children but by only 4.2% of vaccinated children, resulting in a 56.3% vaccine effectiveness. conclusions: following universal pcv7 immunization, a clear epidemiological impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was observed as pcv7 serotypes have almost disappeared among aom.
temporal association of infant immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the ecology of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus nasopharyngeal colonisation in a rural south african community.
background: immunisation of children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (pcv) may affect the bacterial-ecology of the nasopharynx, including colonisation by streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of infant pcv-immunisation on the nasopharyngeal ecology of these potentially pathogenic bacteria in a rural african setting. methods: two cross sectional surveys were undertaken from may to october in 2009 (period-1) which coincided with the introduction of 7-valent pcv (pcv7) and in may-october 2011 (period-2). consenting household members, where there was a child <2 years of age in residence, had nasopharyngeal swabs undertaken for culture. results: from period-1 to period-2 in children 0-2 years and 3-12 years, prevalence of overall s. pneumoniae colonisation decreased from 74.9% to 67.0% (p<0.001) and h. influenzae declined among children 3-12 years (55.1-45.3%, p<0.001) but not among those <2 years. the prevalence of s. aureus remained unchanged in all children. competitive associations were found between s. pneumoniae and s. aureus and between h. influenzae and s. aureus among children. in individuals >12 years, the prevalence of colonisation decreased from 11.2% to 6.8%, 16.7% to 8.8% and 31.2% to 23.7% for s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and s. aureus, respectively; p<0.001 for all comparions. synergistic relationships for s. aureus with h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were observed in both periods among this group.
ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in europe, turkey, and israel from 2005 to 2010.
ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated hap patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in europe, turkey, and israel during 2005 through 2010. a total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with mic90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant cons, having a mic90 of 2 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was active against enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most enterococcus faecium isolates. ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. the potency of ceftobiprole against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at mic values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (mic50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against acinetobacter spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. high activity was also observed against all haemophilus influenzae (mic90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
potent sub-mic effect of gsk1322322 and other peptide deformylase inhibitors on in vitro growth of staphylococcus aureus.
peptide deformylase (pdf), a clinically unexploited antibacterial target, plays an essential role in protein maturation. pdf inhibitors, therefore, represent a new antibiotic class with a unique mode of action that provides an alternative therapy for the treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). gsk1322322 is a novel pdf inhibitor that is in phase ii clinical development for the treatment of lower respiratory tract and skin infections. we have discovered that pdf inhibitors can prevent s. aureus in vitro growth for up to 6 h at concentrations 8- to 32-fold below their mics. this phenomenon seems specific to pdf inhibitors, as none of the antimicrobial agents with alternative mechanisms of action tested show such a potent and widespread effect. it also appears limited to s. aureus, as pdf inhibitors do not show such an inhibition of growth at sub-mic levels in streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae. analysis of the effect of gsk1322322 on the early growth of 100 randomly selected s. aureus strains showed that concentrations equal to or below 1/8x mic inhibited growth of 91% of the strains tested for 6 h, while the corresponding amount of moxifloxacin or linezolid only affected the growth of 1% and 6% of strains, respectively. furthermore, the sub-mic effect demonstrated by gsk1322322 appears more substantial on those strains at the higher end of the mic spectrum. these effects may impact the clinical efficacy of gsk1322322 in serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant s. aureus.
fragment-to-hit-to-lead discovery of a novel pyridylurea scaffold of atp competitive dual targeting type ii topoisomerase inhibiting antibacterial agents.
the discovery and optimization of a new class of bacterial topoisomerase (dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv) inhibitors binding in the atp domain are described. a fragment molecule, 1-ethyl-3-(2-pyridyl)urea, provided sufficiently potent enzyme inhibition (32 mum) to prompt further analogue work. acids and acid isosteres were incorporated at the 5-pyridyl position of this fragment, bridging to a key asparagine residue, improving enzyme inhibition, and leading to measurable antibacterial activity. a cf3-thiazole substituent at the 4-pyridyl position improved inhibitory potency due to a favorable lipophilic interaction. promising antibacterial activity was seen versus the gram-positive pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and the gram-negative pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis . precursor metabolite incorporation and mutant analysis studies support the mode-of-action, blockage of dna synthesis by dual target topoisomerase inhibition. compound 35 was efficacious in a mouse s. aureus disease model, where a 4.5-log reduction in colony forming units versus control was demonstrated.
spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against leading pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections in latin america, 2010.
ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common gram-negative organisms. in this study a total of 986 isolates collected in 2010 from patients in 15 medical centers in five latin american countries from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation program were identified as community-acquired respiratory tract or skin and soft tissue infection pathogens. ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested against s. pneumoniae with a mic90 value (0.12mug/ml) that was eight-fold lower than ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and linezolid. its spectrum of coverage (100.0% susceptible) was similar to tigecycline, linezolid, levofloxacin and vancomycin. against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, ceftaroline was the most active agent tested. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus (including mrsa) was similar to that of vancomycin and tetracycline (mic90, 1mug/ml) and linezolid (mic90, 2mug/ml). the beta-haemolytic streptococci exhibited 100.0% susceptibility to ceftaroline. ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. was similar to that of ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. these parenteral cephalosporin agents have potent activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains, but are not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains. these results confirm the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against pathogens common in community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infection in latin america, and suggest that ceftaroline fosamil could be an important therapeutic option for these infections.
antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic bc-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
bc-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. bc-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi). its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). in this study, the antibacterial activity of bc-3781 was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing absssi and cabp, among other infections, collected within the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program worldwide in 2010. bc-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from absssi such as staphylococcus aureus (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). bc-3781 displayed similar mic distributions among methicillin-susceptible (mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) s. aureus strains. bc-3781 was also active against enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at bc-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to bc-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. further, activity of bc-3781 against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. in all, bc-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing absssi and cabp, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.
analysis of antimicrobial resistance and class 1 integrons among strains from upper respiratory tract of healthy adults.
objective: the distribution and characterization of integrons among opportunistic pathogens from nasopharynx of healthy adults. methods: a total of 1,019 nasopharyngeal samples from healthy adults were collected; bacteria were identified by api system; antibiotic susceptibility were tested by k-b method; class 1, 2 and 3 integrons were examined by degenerate primers of the genetic content of integrons were analyzed by pcr and dna sequencing. results: out of the 1,019 cases, 743 (72.9%) opportunistic pathogens were isolated. the top five commons organism identified were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=404), staphylococcus aureus (n=109), haemophilus influenzae (n=74), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=49) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=32). eight (25.0%) isolates of k. pneumoniae produced the esbls. the isolated rates of s. aureus and h. influenzae were decreased with aging. 6.3% (2/32) k. pneumoniae isolates and 16.7% (1/8) proteus isolates carried class 1 integrons. among inti1-positive strains, sequencing analysis revealed that one of the integron positive k. pneumoniae isolates harbored gene cassette aada5-dfra17. proteus isolates harbored gene cassette aada2-dhfrxii. conclusions: the results stressed the need for continued surveillance of bacteria from the asymptomatic carriers.
comparative analysis of the antibacterial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, gsk1322322.
gsk1322322 is a novel peptide deformylase (pdf) inhibitor being developed for the intravenous and oral treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. the activity of gsk1322322 was tested against a global collection of clinical isolates of haemophilus influenzae (n = 2,370), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 115), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 947), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 617), and staphylococcus aureus (n = 940), including strains resistant to one or more marketed antibiotics. gsk1322322 had an mic(90) of 1 mug/ml against m. catarrhalis and 4 mug/ml against h. influenzae, with 88.8% of beta-lactamase-positive strains showing growth inhibition at that concentration. all s. pneumoniae strains were inhibited by </= 4 mug/ml of gsk1322322, with an mic(90) of 2 mug/ml. pre-existing resistance mechanisms did not affect its potency, as evidenced by the mic(90) of 1 mug/ml for penicillin, levofloxacin, and macrolide-resistant s. pneumoniae. gsk1322322 was very potent against s. pyogenes strains, with an mic(90) of 0.5 mug/ml, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotype. this pdf inhibitor was also active against s. aureus strains regardless of their susceptibility to methicillin, macrolides, or levofloxacin, with an mic(90) of 4 mug/ml in all cases. time-kill studies showed that gsk1322322 had bactericidal activity against s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus, demonstrating a >/= 3-log(10) decrease in the number of cfu/ml at 4x mic within 24 h in 29 of the 33 strains tested. given the antibacterial potency demonstrated against this panel of organisms, gsk1322322 represents a valuable alternative therapy for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant pathogens.
a retrospective evaluation of microbiology of acute otitis media complicated by spontaneous otorrhea in children living in milan, italy.
purpose: to evaluate the microbiology of acute otitis media (aom) with otorrhea due to spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation (stmp) in children living in milan, italy. methods: we evaluated middle ear fluid (mef) specimens taken from children affected by aom associated with stmp and otorrhea between january 2001 and december 2011. the fluid was collected by means of direct swab sampling, sent for culture, and processed within 4 h. results: a total of 705 specimens were obtained from 458 children (233 boys; mean age +/- sd 28.3 +/- 19.9 months), and were positive for bacteria in 487 cases (69.1 %). the most frequently cultured infectious agent in single-pathogen cultures was haemophilus. influenzae (51.0 %), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4 %), streptococcus pyogenes (17.4 %), and staphylococcus aureus (10.7 %). after adjusting for the sub-period of data collection, age, gender, and previous full heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-7) schedule, it was found that the prevalence of h. influenzae slightly increased in 2008-2010, and the prevalence of s. pneumoniae significantly decreased over time (p = 0.02). conclusions: aom with stmp is a particular form of aom in which s. pyogenes plays a significant causative role although, as in uncomplicated cases, h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae retain their etiological importance. the frequency of the detection of s. aureus in mef deserves further study because this pathogen can give rise to severe clinical problems. finally, although the use of pcv-7 was relatively efficacious, the benefit of pneumococcal vaccination would be increased by vaccines including a larger number of serotypes.
a reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in lebanon over a decade.
background: antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. this study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in beirut. methods: data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the cap accredited clinical microbiology laboratory is analyzed from january 2000 to november 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. results: increasing rates of esbl-producing isolates were noted for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in acinetobacter spp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in e. coli and k. pneumoniae. tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most esbl and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. resistance to quinolones is being encountered in streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in s. pneumoniae, group a streptococci, s. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. conclusion: physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. these resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint.
septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is a rare acute infectious disease that requires attention from physicians and, once misdiagnosed, can have several implications for a patient. the most common microorganisms related to this disease are staphylococcus aureus, neisseria, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus. the infection of the joint may be caused by a direct spread of a local infection or by hematogenous inoculation from a distant focus. general predisposing factors, such as immunodepression, can eventually be found. the aim of the current study was to report a case in which a patient with an articular infection resulting from hematogenous dissemination from a distant site was successfully treated using joint drainage and systemic antibiotics. secretion culture from the temporomandibular joint space was positive for s. aureus. after 1 month of antimicrobial therapy, the patient was asymptomatic and mandibular function was normal. literature related to this topic was reviewed and discussed.
structures of staphylococcus aureus peptide deformylase in complex with two classes of new inhibitors.
peptide deformylase (pdf) catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from the n-terminal methionine residue in newly synthesized polypeptides, which is an essential process in bacteria. four new inhibitors of pdf that belong to two different classes, hydroxamate/pseudopeptide compounds [pmt387 (7a) and pmt497] and reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds [pmt1039 (15e) and pmt1067], have been developed. these compounds inhibited the growth of several pathogens involved in respiratory-tract infections, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, and leading nosocomial pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in the range 0.1-0.8 mg ml(-1). interestingly, the reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds showed a 250-fold higher antimicrobial activity towards s. aureus, although the four compounds showed similar k(i) values against s. aureus pdf enzymes, with k(i) values in the 11-85 nm range. to provide a structural basis for the discovery of additional pdf inhibitors, the crystal structures of s. aureus pdf in complex with the four inhibitors were determined at resolutions of 1.90-2.30 a. the inhibitor-bound structures displayed distinct deviations depending on the inhibitor class. the distance between the zn(2+) ion and the carbonyl o atom of the hydroxamate inhibitors (or the hydroxyl o atom of the reverse-hydroxamate inhibitors) appears to be correlated to s. aureus inhibition activity. the structural information reported in this study should aid in the discovery of new pdf inhibitors that can be used as novel antibacterial drugs.
chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods: the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si = 3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
discovery of a compound that acts as a bacterial pyrg (ctp synthase) inhibitor.
pyrg (ctp synthase) catalyses the conversion of utp to ctp, an essential step in  the pyrimidine metabolic pathway in a variety of bacteria, including those causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (rtis). in this study, a luminescence-based atpase assay of pyrg was developed and used to evaluate the inhibitory activity of 2-(3-[3-oxo-1,2-benzisothiazol-2(3h)-yl]phenylsulfonylamino) benzoic acid (compound g1). compound g1 inhibited pyrg derived from streptococcus pneumoniae with a 50 % inhibitory concentration value of 0.091 microm, and the inhibitory activity of compound g1 was 13 times higher than that of acivicin (1.2 microm), an established pyrg inhibitor. the results of saturation transfer difference analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggested that these compounds compete with atp and/or utp for binding to strep. pneumoniae pyrg. finally, compound g1 was shown to have antimicrobial activity against several different bacteria causing rtis, such as staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, suggesting that it is a prototype chemical compound that could be harnessed as an antimicrobial drug with a novel structure to target bacterial pyrg.
ceftaroline fosamil for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.
introduction: bacterial resistance is increasing on a global basis, making treatment options more limited. the development of new agents to meet this threat is a matter of urgency. ceftaroline fosamil , a member of an advanced cephalosporin class of antimicrobials, is currently approved by the us food and drug administration for use in for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. ceftaroline displays activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including both methicillin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant strains), respiratory pathogens (such as moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains) and limited coverage against enterobacteriaceae. areas covered: chemistry, mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, resistance, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, indications for use, safety and special populations are covered in this review. expert opinion: ceftaroline's unique activity against mrsa and penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant s. pneumoniae strains is due to its high affinity for penicillin binding protein (pbp)-2a and pbp-2x, respectively. in randomized, double-blinded, clinical trials, ceftaroline fosamil was found to be non-inferior to ceftriaxone for the treatment cabp and to vancomycin plus aztreonam for absssi. substantial differences between the cephalosporins exist. ceftaroline has unique characteristics that may make it useful in specific clinical circumstances, especially against multi-drug-resistant gram-positive organisms.
biofilm formation by bacteria isolated from upper respiratory tract before and after adenotonsillectomy.
failure of antibiotics to eradicate the microbial pathogens primarily responsible for otorhinolaryngological diseases has led to the hypothesis that these microorganisms may be structured in a biolfilm. aim of the study was to evaluate the ability to produce biofilm among bacteria isolated from tonsils and/or adenoids and nasopharynx. biopsies and swabs were collected during surgery and after 3 and 6 months in 32 children undergoing adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy. production of biofilm by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae was evaluated in vitro by means of spectrophotometry after growth in microplates and staining with crystalviolet. of the isolates from intraoperative samples, 44.7% were either moderate or strong biofilm producers compared with 27% of isolates at 6 months after surgery. a decrease in biofilm production was observed for h. influenzae and s. aureus. in conclusion, the rate of isolation and ability to form biofilm decreased in bacteria isolated subsequent to adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy. this suggests a role for biofilm in pathogenesis of recurrent and chronic pharyngeal diseases and rhinopharingitis.
summary of ceftaroline activity against pathogens in the united states, 2010: report from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance program.
the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance  program is a sentinel resistance monitoring system designed to track the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents. in the united states, a total of 8,434 isolates were collected during the 2010 surveillance program from 65 medical centers distributed across the nine census regions (5 to 10 medical centers per region). all organisms were isolated from documented infections, including 3,055 (36.2%) bloodstream infections, 2,282 (27.1%) respiratory tract infections, 1,965 (23.3%) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, 665 (7.9%) urinary tract infections, and 467 (5.5%) miscellaneous other infection sites. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam agent tested against staphylococci. the mic(90) values were 1 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; 98.4% susceptible) and 0.5 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). ceftaroline was 16- to 32-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal strains. all staphylococcus isolates (s. aureus and cons) were inhibited at ceftaroline mic values of </= 2 mug/ml. ceftaroline also displayed potent activity against streptococci (mic(90), 0.015 mug/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci; mic(90), 0.25 mug/ml for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae). potent activity was also shown against gram-negative pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis). furthermore, wild-type strains of enterobacteriaceae (non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producing strains and non-ampc-hyperproducing strains) were often susceptible to ceftaroline. continued monitoring through surveillance networks will allow for the assessment of the evolution of resistance as this new cephalosporin is used more broadly to provide clinicians with up-to-date information to assist in antibiotic stewardship and therapeutic decision making.
discovery of a compound which acts as a bacterial ump kinase pyrh inhibitor.
pyrh is a member of the ump kinase family that catalyses the conversion of ump to udp, an essential step in the pyrimidine metabolic pathway in a variety of bacteria including those causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (rtis). in this study, we have developed a luminescence-based kinase assay of pyrh and evaluated the inhibitory activity of pyrh-1 (sodium {3-[4-tert-butyl-3-(9h-xanthen-9-ylacetylamino)phenyl]-1-cyclohexylmethylpropoxyc arbonyloxy}acetate). pyrh-1 inhibits pyrh derived from both streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae with ic(50) (concentration of inhibitor giving a 50% decrease in enzyme activity) values of 48 and 75 mum, respectively, whose inhibitory activity against s. pneumoniae pyrh was far higher compared with that of utp (ic(50) = 710 mum), an allosteric pyrh inhibitor. the molecular interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance suggested that pyrh-1 directly interacts with s. pneumoniae pyrh at one-to-one molar ratio. finally, pyrh-1 was shown to have antimicrobial activity against several different bacteria causing rtis, such as s. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, h. influenzae (acra knockout strain), suggesting that pyrh-1 is a prototype chemical compound that can be harnessed as an antimicrobial drug with a novel mode of action by targeting bacterial pyrh.
[pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug susceptibility in children with acute  otitis media in pearl river delta].
objective: to investigate the pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug susceptibility in children with acute otitis media (aom) in different age and different season in the pearl river delta region. method: four hundred and forty-two children diagnosed as aom were divided into three groups by age factor and four groups by season factor. midge ear pus collecting and culturing were used for bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility test. result: (1) strains of bacteria were isolated from 356 children with the positive rate of 80.5%. streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%), staphylococcus aureus (25.9%) and haemophilus influenzae (7.4%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. (2) streptococcus pneumoniae was the main pathogenic bacteria in 0-1 year group and > 1-3 years group (p < 0.05), staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen in >3 years group (p < 0.05); (3) in the season groups, the number of children with aom decreased significantly in july-september group. there was no significant difference of streptococcus pneumoniae distribution among the four groups (p > 0.05). staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in january-march group (p < 0.05); (4) drug sensitivity shown that linezolid and ofloxacin were most sensitive to streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus, and macrolides had a good therapy effect to haemophilus influenzae. conclusion: the pathogens distribution and drug susceptibility in children with aom were varies in different age and different season. as a result, a treatment should be done based on the climate, environment, and pathogens distribution of a region.
evaluation of ceftobiprole activity against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, including escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and beta-lactamase negative), and klebsiella pneumoniae, in a rabbit meningitis model.
ceftobiprole medocaril, a new cephalosporin, is highly active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. in this study, we tested ceftobiprole against various gram-negative pathogens in a rabbit meningitis model and determined its penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (csf). in this animal model, ceftobiprole produced an antibacterial activity similar to that of cefepime against an escherichia coli strain, a klebsiella pneumoniae strain, and a beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae strain. against a beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae strain, ceftobiprole was significantly superior. the penetration of ceftobiprole through inflamed meninges reached about 16% of serum levels compared to about 2% of serum levels through uninflamed meninges.
peptidylarginine deiminases present in the airways during tobacco smoking and inflammation can citrullinate the host defense peptide ll-37, resulting in altered activities.
bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract is frequently seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and may cause exacerbations leading to disease progression. antimicrobial peptides comprise an important part of innate lung immunity, and not least the cathelicidin human cationic antimicrobial protein-18/ll-37. peptidylarginine deiminases (padis) post-translationally modify proteins by converting cationic peptidylarginine residues to neutral peptidylcitrulline. an increased presence of padi2 and citrullinated proteins was demonstrated in the lungs of smokers. in this study, preformed padi4, stored in granulocytes and extracellularly in the lumina of bronchi, was found in lung tissue of individuals suffering from copd. in vitro, recombinant human padi2 and padi4 both caused a time- and dose-dependent citrullination of ll-37. the citrullination resulted in impaired antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and nontypable haemophilus influenzae, but less so against pseudomonas aeruginosa. using artificial lipid bilayers, we observed discrete differences when comparing the disrupting activity of native and citrullinated ll-37, suggesting that differences in cell wall composition are important during interactions with whole bacteria. furthermore, citrullinated ll-37 showed higher chemotactic activity against mononuclear leukocytes than did native ll-37, but was less efficient at neutralizing lipolysaccharide, and also in converting apoptotic neutrophils into a state of secondary necrosis. in addition, citrullinated ll-37 was more prone to degradation by proteases, whereas the v8 endopetidase of s. aureus cleaved the modified peptide at additional sites, compared with native ll-37. together, these findings demonstrate novel mechanisms whereby the inflammation-dependent deiminases padi2 and padi4 can alter the activites of antibacterial polypeptides, affecting the course of inflammatory disorders such as copd.
antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in asia: report from the community-acquired respiratory tract infection pathogen surveillance (cartips) study, 2009-2010.
a multicentre resistance surveillance study [community-acquired respiratory tract infection pathogen surveillance (cartips)] investigating the susceptibilities of 2963 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus spp. from asia against 12 antimicrobial agents was undertaken from 2009 to 2010. based on the breakpoints for oral penicillin v recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pnssp) ranged from 46% to 100%. azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited variable resistance rates of 0-88% against s. pneumoniae, 0-57% against mssa and 0-76.5% against streptococcus spp. isolates. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae varied from 5.1% to 58.5%. beta-lactamase production rates amongst h. influenzae isolates ranged from 15% to 46.6% and amongst m. catarrhalis isolates from 90% to 100%. amongst m. catarrhalis isolates, macrolide resistance and cefaclor resistance rates of 5.8% and 1.2%, respectively, were found, mainly in mainland china. levofloxacin resistance rates of 0-3.9% with a mic(90) (minimum inhibitory concentration causing inhibition of 90% of isolates) of 1-2mg/l and moxifloxacin resistance rates of 0-1.7% with a mic(90) of 0.125-0.5mg/l were found amongst pnssp isolates. moxifloxacin was very active against streptococcus spp., h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis isolates, with mic(90) values of 0.125-0.25, 0.032-0.5 and 0.064-0.125mg/l, respectively. these results from the cartips study have confirmed some significant regional differences in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of s. pneumoniae, mssa, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and streptococcus spp. and emphasise the importance of antimicrobial surveillance programmes for guiding empirical therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in distinct geographic areas.
ceftaroline: a new cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa).
microbial resistance has reached alarming levels, threatening to outpace the ability to counter with more potent antimicrobial agents. in particular, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has become a leading cause of skin and soft-tissue infections and pvl-positive strains have been associated with necrotizing pneumonia. increasing reports of growing resistance to glycopeptides have been noted, further limiting the efficacy of standard antibiotics, such as vancomycin. ceftaroline is a novel fifth-generation cephalosporin, which exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa and extensively-resistant strains, such as vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), heteroresistant visa (hvisa), and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa). in addition to being an exciting new agent in the anti-mrsa armamentarium, ceftaroline provides efficacy against many respiratory pathogens including streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. ceftaroline (600 mg intravenously every 12 hours) has been shown effective in phase iii studies in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia. to date, this unique antibiotic exhibits a low propensity for inducing resistance and has a good safety profile, although further post-marketing data and clinical experience are needed. in summary, ceftaroline provides an additional option for the management of complex multidrug resistant infections, including mrsa.
early acquisition and high nasopharyngeal co-colonisation by streptococcus pneumoniae and three respiratory pathogens amongst gambian new-borns and infants.
background: although haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), staphylococcus aureus and moraxella catarrhalis are important causes of invasive and mucosal bacterial disease among children, co-carriage with streptococcus pneumoniae during infancy has not been determined in west africa. methods: species specific pcr was applied to detect each microbe using purified genomic dna from 498 nasopharyngeal (np) swabs collected from 30 gambian neonates every two weeks from 0 to 6 months and bi-monthly up to 12 months. results: all infants carried s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis at several time points during infancy. s.pneumoniae co-colonized the infant nasopharynx with at least one other pathogen nine out of ten times. there was early colonization of the newborns and neonates, the average times to first detection were 5, 7, 3 and 14 weeks for s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis and s. aureus respectively. the prevalence of s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis increased among the neonates and exceeded 80% by 13, 15 and 23 weeks respectively. in contrast, the prevalence of s. aureus decreased from 50% among the newborns to 20% amongst nine-week old neonates. s. pneumoniae appeared to have a strong positive association with h. influenzae (or 5.03; 95% ci 3.02, 8.39; p<0.01) and m. catarrhalis (or 2.20; 95% ci 1.29; p<0.01) but it was negatively associated with s. aureus (or 0.53; 95% ci 0.30, 0.94; p=0.03). conclusion: this study shows early acquisition and high co-carriage of three important respiratory pathogens with s. pneumoniae in the nasopharyngeal mucosa among gambian neonates and infants. this has important potential implications for the aetiology of respiratory polymicrobial infections, biofilm formation and vaccine strategies.
monitoring antibiotic resistance in ocular microorganisms: results from the antibiotic resistance monitoring in ocular microrganisms (armor) 2009 surveillance study.
purpose: to determine the antibacterial susceptibility profile of bacterial pathogens from ocular infections against relevant aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide, lincosamide, and macrolide antibacterial agents. design: laboratory investigation. methods: isolates from patients with bacterial eye infections were collected prospectively by 34 institutions across the united states and were submitted to a central laboratory for inclusion in the antibiotic resistance monitoring in ocular microrganisms (armor) study. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by microbroth dilution for 200 staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), 144 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 75 streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), 73 haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae), and 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) isolates. results: a large proportion of s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to oxacillin/methicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones; 46.5% of s. aureus, 58.3% of coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.0% of p. aeruginosa, and 9.3% of pneumococcal isolates were nonsusceptible to 2 or more antibacterial drug classes. only 2.7% of h. influenzae isolates were nonsusceptible to 1 of the agents tested. methicillin-resistant staphylococci were statistically more likely (all p < .0038) also to be resistant to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. conclusions: resistance to 1 or more antibiotics is prevalent among ocular bacterial pathogens. current resistance trends should be considered before initiating empiric treatment of common eye infections.
pathogen yield and antimicrobial resistance patterns of chronic rhinosinusitis patients presenting to a tertiary rhinology centre.
objectives: to examine the yield and resistance profile of pathogens in chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) patients receiving culture-directed management and to pay particular attention to the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in this population. study design: retrospective review of a crs microbiology database. participants: consecutive crs patients seen at the st. paul's sinus centre between june 2007 and august 2008. setting: canadian tertiary sinus centre. main outcome measure: to determine the pathogens isolated, the frequency of these pathogens, and their resistance profiles. results: the most common bacterial pathogens isolated were staphylococcus aureus, accounting for 39% of cultured samples, followed by haemophilus influenzae (29%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and moraxella catarrhalis (11%). only three cases of mrsa were found, one in a patient with cystic fibrosis. conclusion: mrsa does not appear to pose a significant risk of morbidity in our patient population. however, ongoing concern regarding the increasing prevalence of s. aureus and antimicrobial resistance in chronic sinonasal disease highlights the importance of using culture-directed antimicrobial therapy with the goal of minimizing future resistance patterns.
review of ceftaroline fosamil microbiology: integrated focus studies.
ceftaroline fosamil, the prodrug form of ceftaroline, is a novel broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin that exhibits antibacterial activity against typical respiratory pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and common gram-negative pathogens. in particular, ceftaroline has activity against resistant gram-positive cocci, including penicillin- and multidrug-resistant s. pneumoniae, as well as methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the activity of ceftaroline against these phenotypes is attributed to its ability to bind to modified penicillin-binding proteins with high affinity when compared with other beta-lactams. the activity of ceftaroline is not compromised by the ability of h. influenzae to produce beta-lactamase. ceftaroline fosamil was compared with ceftriaxone for safety and efficacy in two randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). microbiological assessments at baseline included respiratory specimen cultures, blood cultures, urinary antigen testing and atypical pathogen serology testing. by-subject and by-pathogen microbiological outcomes were assessed in the microbiologically evaluable population at the test-of-cure visit. the favourable microbiological response rates by subject for ceftaroline were 87.0% compared with 81.0% for ceftriaxone. the by-pathogen microbiological response rates of ceftaroline and ceftriaxone were 87.3% and 72.9% for s. pneumoniae, 83.3% and 85.0% for h. influenzae and 76.0% and 70.4% for s. aureus, respectively. key baseline pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were susceptible to ceftaroline, with mic(90)s of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively, supporting its utility as a promising new agent for treatment of cap.
bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
the main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. in this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus (27) and streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (31) and prevotella species (30). haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. overall, 22 % of staphylococcus aureus isolates were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.
in vitro and in vivo profiles of ach-702, an isothiazoloquinolone, against bacterial pathogens.
ach-702, a novel isothiazoloquinolone (itq), was assessed for antibacterial activity against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and found to possess broad-spectrum activity, especially against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive strains, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). for gram-negative bacteria, ach-702 showed exceptional potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and a neisseria sp. but was less active against members of the enterobacteriaceae. good antibacterial activity was also evident against several anaerobes as well as legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. excellent bactericidal activity was observed for ach-702 against several bacterial pathogens in time-kill assays, and postantibiotic effects (paes) of >1 h were evident with both laboratory and clinical strains of staphylococci at 10 x mic and similar in most cases to those observed for moxifloxacin at the same mic multiple. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated against s. aureus with murine sepsis and thigh infection models, with decreases in the number of cfu/thigh equal to or greater than those observed after vancomycin treatment. macromolecular synthesis assays showed specific dose-dependent inhibition of dna replication in staphylococci, and biochemical analyses indicated potent dual inhibition of two essential dna replication enzymes: dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. additional biological data in support of an effective dual targeting mechanism of action include the following: low mic values (</=0.25 mug/ml) against staphylococcal strains with single mutations in both gyra and grla (parc), retention of good antibacterial activity (mics of </=0.5 mug/ml) against staphylococcal strains with two mutations in both gyra and grla, and low frequencies for the selection of higher-level resistance (<10(-)(1)(0)). these promising initial data support further study of isothiazoloquinolones as potential clinical candidates.
empirical treatment of influenza-associated pneumonia in primary care: a descriptive study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of lower respiratory tract bacteria (england, wales and northern ireland, january 2007-march 2010).
objectives: to determine the susceptibility of lower respiratory tract (lrt) isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae to antimicrobial agents recommended by uk guidelines for treatment of pneumonia associated with influenza-like illness. methods: analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility data from sentinel microbiology laboratories in england, wales and northern ireland was carried out. subjects comprised patients who had an lrt specimen taken in a general practitioner surgery or hospital outpatient setting between january 2007 and march 2010. the main outcome measurements were antimicrobial susceptibility trends of lrt isolates over time, between patient age groups and in different geographical regions. results: susceptibility to tetracyclines or co-amoxiclav was high. of the 70,288 and 45,288 isolates with susceptibility results for tetracyclines or co-amoxiclav, 96% and 92%, respectively, were susceptible. overall susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin/amoxicillin and macrolides was lower than for tetracyclines or co-amoxiclav and varied markedly by organism. there were few clinically relevant variations in susceptibility to doxycycline or co-amoxiclav over time, geographically or between age groups. conclusions: the data support the use of doxycycline or co-amoxiclav as appropriate empiric treatment for lrt infection caused by the pathogens investigated, for patients in primary care.
discovery of torezolid as a novel 5-hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinone antibacterial agent.
a series of novel substituted pyridyl phenyl oxazolidinone analogues were synthesized and their structure-activity relationship (sar) was investigated based on in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the synthesized compounds against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) ranged from 0.12 to 2.0 mug/ml, and against haemophilus influenzae (hi) from 2.0 to 8.0 mug/ml. compared to linezolid, only four compounds (11, 12, 21 and 29) showed higher in vitro antibacterial activities and better in vivo protective effects in mice. to improve the aqueous solubility, various prodrugs of compound 11 (da-7157), which exerted a potency that was enhanced by 2-8-fold compared to that of linezolid, were synthesized. among the prodrugs, the phosphate compound 42 exhibited excellent aqueous solubility (>50mg/ml in dw) and good pharmacokinetic profiles, along with better in vivo efficacy than linezolid. this compound 42 is currently undergoing clinical trials with the brand name torezolid.
novel bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
dna ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in dna replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase (liga) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. a novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (hts), and these compounds were optimized to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of liga. the adenosine analogs inhibited the liga activities of escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. they were selective for bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against atp-dependent human dna ligase 1 or bacteriophage t4 ligase. enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with nad+. x-ray crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the amp-binding pocket of the liga adenylation domain. antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and m. pneumoniae, as well as against gram-negative pathogens, such as h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. the mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered liga expression, an okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with liga mutations. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine s. aureus thigh infection model and a murine s. pneumoniae lung infection model. treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in cfu) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating liga as a target for antibacterial therapy.
reliability of quantitative real-time pcr for bacterial detection in cystic fibrosis airway specimens.
the cystic fibrosis (cf) airway microbiome is complex; polymicrobial infections are common, and the presence of fastidious bacteria including anaerobes make culture-based diagnosis challenging. quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) offers a culture-independent method for bacterial quantification that may improve diagnosis of cf airway infections; however, the reliability of qpcr applied to cf airway specimens is unknown. we sought to determine the reliability of nine specific bacterial qpcr assays (total bacteria, three typical cf pathogens, and five anaerobes) applied to cf airway specimens. airway and salivary specimens from clinically stable pediatric cf subjects were collected. quantitative pcr assay repeatability was determined using triplicate reactions. split-sample measurements were performed to measure variability introduced by dna extraction. results from qpcr were compared to standard microbial culture for pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae, common pathogens in cf. we obtained 84 sputa, 47 oropharyngeal and 27 salivary specimens from 16 pediatric subjects with cf. quantitative pcr detected bacterial dna in over 97% of specimens. all qpcr assays were highly reproducible at quantities>/=10(2) rrna gene copies/reaction with coefficient of variation less than 20% for over 99% of samples. there was also excellent agreement between samples processed in duplicate. anaerobic bacteria were highly prevalent and were detected in mean quantities similar to that of typical cf pathogens. compared to a composite gold standard, qpcr and culture had variable sensitivities for detection of p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and h. influenzae from cf airway samples. by reliably quantifying fastidious airway bacteria, qpcr may improve our understanding of polymicrobial cf lung infections, progression of lung disease and ultimately improve antimicrobial treatments.
novel hybrids of 15-membered 8a- and 9a-azahomoerythromycin a ketolides and quinolones as potent antibacterials.
a series of novel 6-o-substituted and 6,12-di-o-substituted 8a-aza-8a-homoerythromycin a and 9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin a ketolides were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of representative erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant test strains. another series of ketolides based on 14-membered erythromycin oxime scaffold was also synthesized and their antibacterial activity compared to those of 15-membered azahomoerythromycin analogues. in general, structure-activity studies have shown that 14-membered ketolides displayed favorable antibacterial activity in comparison to their corresponding 15-membered analogues within 9a-azahomoerythromycin series. however, within 8a-azahomoerythromycin series, some compounds incorporating a ketolide combined with either quinoline or quinolone pharmacophore substructures showed significantly potent activity against a variety of erythromycin-susceptible and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mls(b))-resistant gram-positive pathogens as well as fastidious gram-negative pathogens. the best compounds in this series overcome all types of resistance in relevant clinical gram-positive pathogens and display hitherto unprecedented in vitro activity against the constitutively mls(b)-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus. in addition, they also represent an improvement over telithromycin (2) and cethromycin (3) against fastidious gram-negative pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis.
discovery and analysis of 4h-pyridopyrimidines, a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
bacterial protein synthesis is the target for numerous natural and synthetic antibacterial agents. we have developed a poly(u) mrna-directed aminoacylation/translation protein synthesis system composed of phenyl-trna synthetases, ribosomes, and ribosomal factors from escherichia coli. this system, utilizing purified components, has been used for high-throughput screening of a small-molecule chemical library. we have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis with 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic(50)s) ranging from 3 to 14 mum. this series of compounds all contained the same central scaffold composed of tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol (e.g., 4h-pyridopyrimidine). all analogs contained an ortho pyridine ring attached to the central scaffold in the 2 position and either a five- or a six-member ring tethered to the 6-methylene nitrogen atom of the central scaffold. these compounds inhibited the growth of e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, with mics ranging from 0.25 to 32 mug/ml. macromolecular synthesis (mms) assays with e. coli and s. aureus confirmed that antibacterial activity resulted from specific inhibition of protein synthesis. assays were developed for the steps performed by each component of the system in order to ascertain the target of the compounds, and the ribosome was found to be the site of inhibition.
synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4''-carbamates of 6,11-di-o-methylerythromycin a.
a novel series of 4''-carbamates of 6,11-di-o-methylerythromycin a were synthesized and evaluated. these compounds have significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive pathogens, including erythromycin-resistant but methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and gram-negative pathogens, such as haemophilus influenzae to our surprise, most of the derivatives tested had potent activity against most resistant bacteria. among these, compounds 10u, 10v, 10w and 10y were found to have potent activity against most susceptible and resistant bacteria. in particular, compound 10y exhibited excellent antibacterial activity in comparison to others.
the ecology of nasal colonization of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus: the role of competition and interactions with host's immune response.
background: the first step in invasive disease caused by the normally commensal bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae is their colonization of the nasal passages. for any population to colonize a new habitat it is necessary for it to be able to compete with the existing organisms and evade predation. in the case of colonization of these species the competition is between strains of the same and different species of bacteria and the predation is mediated by the host's immune response. here, we use a neonatal rat model to explore these elements of the ecology of nasal colonization by these occasionally invasive bacteria. results: when neonatal rats are colonized by any one of these species the density of bacteria in the nasal passage rapidly reaches a steady-state density that is species-specific but independent of inoculum size. when novel populations of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae are introduced into the nasal passages of neonatal rats with established populations of the same species, residents and invaders coexisted. however, this was not the case for s. aureus - the established population inhibited invasion of new s. aureus populations. in mixed-species introductions, s. aureus or s. pneumoniae facilitated the invasion of another h. influenzae population; for other pairs the interaction was antagonistic and immune-mediated. for example, under some conditions h. influenzae promoted an immune response which limited the invasion of s. pneumoniae. conclusions: nasal colonization is a dynamic process with turnover of new strains and new species. these results suggest that multiple strains of either h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae can coexist; in contrast, s. aureus strains require a host to have no other s. aureus present to colonize. levels of colonization (and hence the possible risk of invasive disease) by h. influenzae are increased in hosts pre-colonized with either s. aureus or s. pneumoniae.
antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
the study group on antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from respiratory infections was established in 1981 in japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions. examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin g in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp + prsp) reached almost 60% in 2001. the proportion of prsp also increased, reaching 19.4%. thereafter, the rate of pisp + prsp decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with mics >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. among staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all s. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. in 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. for klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. the mic distribution patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher mics when compared with the mics for other pathogens. broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating p. aeruginosa infection. regarding moraxella catarrhalis, beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with mics <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.
[analysis on the sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of respiratory-infectious isolates on the second survey on the sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007--concerning the aspect of pk/pd break points].
sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of isolates clinically obtained from respiratory infection sites in adults on the second survey on sensitivity of isolates conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy in 2007 was investigated according to the classification of the "guideline for treatment for adult nosocomial pneumonia in 2008". among the primary antibacterial drugs for mild (a) and moderate (b) nosocomial pneumonia in adults, beta-lactam antibiotics; ceftriaxone (ctrx), sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc), panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), meropenem (mepm), doripenem (drpm), biapenem (bipm) were studied to evaluate their clinical efficacy. the covering rate was analyzed using the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and break point of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd). consequently, the results with methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae revealed the mic90 of all antibacterial drugs to be at low levels, while almost 100% of isolates were within the range of pk/pd break points except bipm and sbt/abpc to h. influenzae, and sbt/abpc to k. pneumoniae. however, the analysis of p. aeruginosa didn't reach 100% for the covering rates of isolates, indicating that these drugs did not have a complete inhibitory action to restrict bacterial proliferation. the analysis of all 5 carbapenem drugs showed superiority to taz/pipc in mic90 while covering rates of isolates at pk/pd break points showed inferiority to taz/pipc. this tendency was found to be more significant in covering the rates of isolates on the regular dose with maximal bactericidal action and on the maximum dose. this is because the maximum dose approved in japan is as low as half that in ipm/cs and 1/3 that in mepm in western countries.
pediatric pleural effusions: etiological evaluation in 492 patients over 29 years.
pediatric pleural effusions present a changing profile over time, both in terms of etiological subgroups and causative microorganisms in parapneumonic effusions. this retrospective study aimed to review pediatric pleural effusions in a large cohort over a 29-year period, with special emphasis on the etiological subgroups and microbiological causes of parapneumonic effusions. the medical records of 492 pediatric patients were reviewed for a comparison of subgroups of pleural effusions and microbiological causes of parapneumonic effusions between three decades. parapneumonic effusions (381 patients) made up 77.4% of the group. tuberculous pleurisy decreased, but malignant effusions doubled in number over time. a causative microorganism was identified in 34.6% overall, with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae being the two most common. relative frequency of s. aureus decreased, whereas pneumococci and haemophilus influenzae were more frequent in recent years.
novel ureas and thioureas of 15-membered azalides with antibacterial activity against key respiratory pathogens.
the new ureas and thioureas of 15-membered azalides, n''-substituted 9a-(n'-carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl) (4), 9a-(n'-thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl) (6), 9a-[n'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-n'-(carbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)] (8) and 9a-[n'-(beta-cyanoethyl)-n'-(thiocarbamoyl-gamma-aminopropyl)] (10) of 9-deoxo-9-dihydro-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin a (2), were synthesized and structurally characterized by nmr and ir spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. the new compounds were evaluated in vitro against a panel of erythromycin susceptible and erythromycin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. these compounds displayed an excellent overall antibacterial in vitro activity against erythromycin sensitive gram-positive strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and good against negative strains, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. in addition, several ureas with naphthyl substituents (4f, 4g, 4h) showed better activity in comparison to azithromycin against inducible resistant s. pyogenes. ureas with naphthyl substituents 4g, 4h and thiourea 8h displayed moderate activity against constitutively resistant s. pneumoniae.
[microbiological diagnosis of bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in cystic fibrosis].
cystic fibrosis (cf), a condition produced by mutations in the gene that encodes  the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is the most prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease in caucasian populations. among other repercussions, this defect leads to an alteration of respiratory secretions and determines a predisposition for chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection, which is the main driver of the high morbidity and early mortality of cf patients. colonization by staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae is frequent in children younger than 10 years, but mucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa is by far the most relevant pathogen in adults with cf and is responsible for the progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration. as a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia, achromobacter spp. and burkholderia cepacia complex, is also frequent in adult cf patients. the special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in cf make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.
long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment reduces the incidence but increases macrolide resistance in staphylococcus aureus in danish cf patients.
background: since 2001, long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment has been used  for cf patients chronically infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa in the copenhagen cf centre. our study investigates changes in incidence of colonization with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis and changes in macrolide sensitivity in these microorganisms during azithromycin treatment. methods: cf patients treated continuously with azithromycin for at least 3 months were included. results of microbiological examination, including phage typing results of s. aureus, obtained during treatment were compared to results obtained 2 years before treatment. results: 70 patients (median age 29.1 years) treated for a median of 4 years (range 0.7-5.1) were included. before treatment, 44 patients had at least one culture positive for s. aureus compared to 25 patients during treatment (p<0.01). mean percentage of sputum samples with growth of s. aureus decreased from 12.1% (range 0-82.6%) before treatment to 6.1% (range 0-93.2) during treatment (p<0.0006). prevalence's of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae also decreased significantly. fifteen of 214 isolates (7%) of s. aureus were macrolide resistant before treatment, increasing to 95 of 181 isolates (52.5%) during treatment (p<0.001). macrolide resistant strains were found in 3 of 44 s. aureus colonized patients before treatment and in 11 of 25 patients at some time during treatment (p<0.03), all belonging to different phage types. first resistant s. aureus isolate was isolated after a median treatment duration of 1.5 years (range 0.3-2.9). no mrsa were isolated. only 1 macrolide resistant isolate of m. catarrhalis was found during treatment. no macrolide resistance was found in h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae. conclusion: long-term, low-dose treatment with azithromycin in cf patients leads to reduced prevalence of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae, but increased macrolide resistance in s. aureus. reduction in the prevalence of s. aureus will make increasing macrolide resistance clinically insignificant in these patients.
the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the japanese society of chemotherapy. part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from january to august 2006. with the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (rtis). antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 staphylococcus aureus, 200 streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 streptococcus pyogenes, 165 haemophilus influenzae, 91 moraxella catarrhalis, 74 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the central laboratory of the research center for anti-infective drugs of the kitasato institute, according to recommendations issued by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). the antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing abpc-resistant (blnar), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). three (2.1%) of the 143 p. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult rti to various antibacterial agents. these data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
isolation, structure and antibacterial activity of pleosporone from a pleosporalean ascomycete discovered by using antisense strategy.
protein synthesis is one of the best antibacterial targets that have led to the development of a number of highly successful clinical drugs. protein synthesis is catalyzed by ribosome, which is comprised of a number of ribosomal proteins that help the catalysis process. ribosomal protein s4 (rpsd) is one of the proteins that is a part of the ribosomal machinery and is a potential new target for the discovery of antibacterial agents. screening of microbial extracts using antisense-sensitized rpsd staphylococcus aureus strain led to the isolation of pleosporone, a new compound, with modest antibacterial activities with mic ranging from 1 to 64 microg/ml. this compound showed the highest sensitivity for streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, and exhibited mic's of 4 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. pleosporone showed modest selectivity for the inhibition of rna synthesis compared to dna and protein synthesis, and showed activity against hela cells. isolation, structure elucidation, and biological activity of pleosporone have been described.
the antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. in the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. we found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, in addition to p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. a similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 a62d/m63l, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to nacl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. this enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
secular trends in pediatric bloodstream infections over a 20-year period at a tertiary care hospital in germany.
objective: over the last 20 years, a number of medical innovations with impact on the incidence of bacterial and fungal bloodstream infections (bsis) in children have been developed and implemented. although appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is a prerequisite to the successful treatment of bsis, to date, epidemiological data on long-term microbiological trends in bsis of hospitalized children have not been available. methods: two cohorts of pediatric patients who were hospitalized in a single-center tertiary care hospital in germany over a 20-year time span (period a from 1985 to 1995 vs. period b from 1997 to 2006) were retrospectively analyzed and compared with respect to the epidemiology and microbiology of bsis. results: a total of 1,646 cases of monomicrobial bsis were detected. the rate of positive blood culture results dropped from 4.5% in period a to 2.0% in period b. the proportion of gram-positive vs. gram-negative pathogens recovered from blood cultures remained stable. among gram-positive pathogens, an increase in enterococci (3.3% vs. 8.2%) and in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (22.9 vs. 28.2%) was observed. in contrast, bsis caused by staphylococcus aureus (16.4% vs. 11.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.9% vs. 2.1%), haemophilus influenzae (7.3% vs. 0.7%), and neisseria meningitidis (1.9% vs. 0.5%) diminished. in analyzing subgroups, an increase of enterococcal and cons infections was noted among patients with immunosuppression and neonatal early-onset sepsis (eos), while a decrease was found among late-onset sepsis (los) cases with s. viridans. notably, aminopenicillin-resistant enterococci and aminopenicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacteriaceae all increased over time, while the overall resistance pattern was still favorable. the overall mortality rate of bsis decreased (5.2% vs. 2.6%). conclusions: over the 20-year study period, the spectrum of specific microorganisms among bsis shifted, with opportunistic pathogens becoming predominant. despite an increase in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant organisms, however, the mortality rate decreased.
tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in italy.
background: in this study (part of the global test program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in italy was evaluated. methods: a total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the clsi in 2005. results: globally, 135 gram-negative and 65 gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against acinetobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic(90) <or=1 mg/l. conclusion: tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both gram-positive and gram-negative clinical pathogens. these data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
[drug susceptibility of haemophilus sp. and staphylococcus aureus strains colonizing respiratory tract in children with mucoviscidosis].
objective: the aim of our studies was to isolate haemophili rods and s. aureus from children with mucoviscidosis and to assess antimicrobial agent susceptibility of the isolates. methods: sputa and nasopharynx swabs from 12 children with mucoviscidosis were screened for the prevalence ofhaemophilus sp. and s. aureus. susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was performed by agar diffusion method using appropriate media. beta-lactamase activity was determined with the nitrocefin discs, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance using d-test. main observations: of 12 mucoviscidosis-positive patients, 7 (58.33%) were colonisated by haemophili rods (a total of 8 h. parainfluenzae, 2 h. influenzae or 2 haemophilus sp. isolates) and by s. aureus (8 isolates), in these species were isolated alone or in mixed cultures. two ampicillin-resistant haemophilus sp. but without beta-lactamases production were obtained. also two methicillin resistant s. aureus with constitutive phenotype of resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and streptogramins b isolates and two methicillin-sensitive (with constitutive and inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides and streptogramins b) were isolated.
alterations of the oropharyngeal microbial flora after adenotonsillectomy in children: a randomized controlled trial.
objectives: to determine whether the oropharyngeal microbial flora changes after  adenotonsillectomy (aty) in children with mild to moderate symptoms of throat infections or adenotonsillar hypertrophy and to relate these findings to recurrence of throat infections. design: randomized controlled trial. setting: twenty-three general hospitals and 3 academic centers. patients: three hundred children aged 2 to 8 years who were selected for aty because of recurrent throat infections (3-6 episodes per year) or obstructive complaints. children with a history of 7 or more throat infections in the previous year and those with a high suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea according to current medical practice were excluded. interventions: children were randomly assigned to either aty or watchful waiting. oropharyngeal swabs were taken at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after baseline. main outcome measures: the primary outcome measure was the prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx at 3 and 12 months. the secondary outcome measure was the association between carriage of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) at baseline and at 3 months' follow-up and the number of throat infections during the 12 months of follow-up. results: in the aty group, prevalences of haemophilus influenzae, gabhs, and staphylococcus aureus decreased from 40%, 13%, and 5%, respectively, at baseline to respective levels of 24%, 0%, and 0% at 3 months and 26%, 0%, and 0% at 12 months. in the watchful waiting group, prevalences of h influenzae, gabhs, and s aureus did not change substantially. in neither the aty nor the watchful waiting group was carriage of gabhs associated with recurrence of throat infections. conclusions: adenotonsillectomy reduced oropharyngeal carriage of potential respiratory pathogens. changes in the carriage rate of gabhs, however, had no beneficial effect on recurrence of throat infections.
from bacterial genomes to novel antibacterial agents: discovery, characterization, and antibacterial activity of compounds that bind to hi0065 (yjee) from haemophilus influenzae.
as part of a fully integrated and comprehensive strategy to discover novel antibacterial agents, nmr- and mass spectrometry-based affinity selection screens were performed to identify compounds that bind to protein targets uniquely found in bacteria and encoded by genes essential for microbial viability. a biphenyl acid lead series emerged from an nmr-based screen with the haemophilus influenzae protein hi0065, a member of a family of probable atp-binding proteins found exclusively in eubacteria. the structure-activity relationships developed around the nmr-derived biphenyl acid lead were consistent with on-target antibacterial activity as the staphylococcus aureus antibacterial activity of the series correlated extremely well with binding affinity to hi0065, while the correlation of binding affinity with b-cell cytotoxicity was relatively poor. although further studies are needed to conclusively establish the mode of action of the biphenyl series, these compounds represent novel leads that can serve as the basis for the development of novel antibacterial agents that appear to work via an unprecedented mechanism of action. overall, these results support the genomics-driven hypothesis that targeting bacterial essential gene products that are not present in eukaryotic cells can identify novel antibacterial agents.
antibacterial activity of carbapenems against clinically isolated respiratory bacterial pathogens in japan between 2005 and 2006.
the current status of the susceptibility of the main respiratory bacterial pathogens was evaluated by analysing the antibacterial activity of 21 drugs, including four carbapenems, against five species of the pathogens isolated between january 2005 and january 2006. a total of 157 strains were studied. carbapenems inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains at concentrations that were below the breakpoints set by the japanese society of chemotherapy (2 and 1mug/ml for pneumonia and chronic respiratory tract infection, respectively). however, the majority of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to carbapenems. meropenem, but not the other carbapenems, inhibited the growth of all of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae isolates, including beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of <or=1 microg/ml. the mic(50) and mic(90) of meropenem, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, against pseudomonas aeruginosa were the lowest of the carbapenems. by comparing these results with our previous data, it was found that there was no increase in resistance to carbapenems in any of the species tested. thus, it can be stated that carbapenems have retained their position as key drugs for severe respiratory tract infections.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of heteroaryl isothiazolones against resistant gram-positive pathogens.
the activities of several tricyclic heteroaryl isothiazolones (hitzs) against an  assortment of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates were assessed. these compounds target bacterial dna replication and were found to possess broad-spectrum activities especially against gram-positive strains, including antibiotic-resistant staphylococci and streptococci. these included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-nonsusceptible staphylococci, and quinolone-resistant strains. the hitzs were more active than the comparator antimicrobials in most cases. for gram-negative bacteria, the tested compounds were less active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae but showed exceptional potencies against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. good activity against several anaerobes, as well as legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae, was also observed. excellent bactericidal activity against staphylococci was observed in time-kill assays, with an approximately 3-log drop in the numbers of cfu/ml occurring after 4 h of exposure to compound. postantibiotic effects (paes) of 2.0 and 1.7 h for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and mrsa strains, respectively, were observed, and these were similar to those seen with moxifloxacin at 10x mic. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in murine infections by using sepsis and thigh infection models. the 50% protective doses were <or=1 mg/kg of body weight against s. aureus in the sepsis model, while decreases in the numbers of cfu per thigh equal to or greater than those detected in animals treated with a standard dose of vancomycin were seen in the animals with thigh infections. pharmacokinetic analyses of treated mice indicated exposures similar to those to ciprofloxacin at equivalent dose levels. these promising initial data suggest further study on the use of the hitzs as antibacterial agents.
dual targeting of gyrb and pare by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
a structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential atpase activities of bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv and that show potent activities against a variety of bacterial pathogens. two such compounds, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. in metabolite incorporation assays, vrt-125853 inhibited both dna and rna synthesis but had little effect on protein synthesis. both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid dna in escherichia coli at the mic. sequencing of dna corresponding to the gyrb and pare atp-binding regions in vrt-125853- and vrt-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae was gyrb, whereas in streptococcus pneumoniae it was pare. in enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of vrt-125853 was pare, whereas for vrt-752586 it was gyrb. dna transformation experiments with h. influenzae and s. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrb resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in s. aureus, h. influenzae, and s. pneumoniae were found in gyrb, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to vrt-125853 or vrt-752586 and vice versa. furthermore, gyrb and pare double mutations increased the mics of vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. spontaneous frequencies of resistance to vrt-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type e. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility in vitro.
evaluation of the flora of northern mexico for in vitro antimicrobial and antituberculosis activity.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential antimicrobial activity of 14 plants used in northeast mexico for the treatment of respiratory diseases, against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type b and mycobacterium tuberculosis. forty-eight organic and aqueous extracts were tested against these bacterial strains using a broth microdilution test. no aqueous extracts showed antimicrobial activity, whereas most of the organic extracts presented antimicrobial activity against at least one of the drug-resistant microorganisms tested. methanol-based extracts from the roots and leaves of leucophyllum frutescens and ethyl ether extract from the roots of chrysanctinia mexicana showed the greatest antimicrobial activity against the drug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) were 62.5, 125 and 62.5 microg/ml, respectively; methanol-based extract from the leaves of cordia boissieri showed the best antimicrobial activity against the drug-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus (mic 250 microg/ml); the hexane-based extract from the fruits of schinus molle showed considerable antimicrobial activity against the drug-resistant strain of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic 62.5 microg/ml). this study supports that selecting plants by ethnobotanical criteria enhances the possibility of finding species with activity against resistant microorganisms.
comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1998-2004).
a contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in north america was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. the rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >escherichia coli (7.8%) >pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). both cefepime and ceftriaxone (mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against s. pneumoniae. however, the s. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible s. aureus, (mic(90), 4 microg/ml; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (mic(90), 16 microg/ml) was active against only 86.7% of strains. h. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (mic(90), < or =0.5 microg/ml; 100.0%), and 34.0% of h. influenzae and 99.2% of m. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against e. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against klebsiella spp. cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against enterobacter spp. (mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). against p. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in north america.
population distributions of minimum inhibitory concentration--increasing accuracy and utility.
aims: to generate continuous minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data that describes the discrete nature of experimentally derived population mic data. methods and results: a logistic model was fitted to experimentally derived mic population cumulative distributions from clinical isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, bsac and mystic population susceptibility databases). from the model continuous distributions of population susceptibility were generated. the experimentally observed population distributions based on discrete mic could be reproduced from this underlying continuous distribution. monte carlo (mc) simulation was used to confirm findings. where the discrete experimental data contained few or no isolates with mic greater or less than the antimicrobial concentration range tested, the true mean mic was a factor of 0.707 times that normally reported and may be of little clinical significance. where data contained isolates beyond the range of concentration used, the true mic was dependent on the sd and the number of isolates and could be clinically significant. subpopulations of differing susceptibilities could be modelled successfully using a modified logistic equation: this allows a more accurate examination of the data from these databases. conclusions: the mean mic and sd of population data currently reported are incorrect as the method of obtaining such parameters relies on normally distributed data which current mic population data are not. significance and impact of the study: obtaining the distribution parameters from the underlying continuous distribution of mic can be carried out using a simple logistic equation. mc simulation using these values allows easy visualization of the discrete data. the analyses of subpopulations within the data should increase the usefulness of horizontal studies.
antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
[the analysis of the isolated microorganisms from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients treated in children's memorial health institute 1999-2002].
the aim of the study was, to analyze the microorganisms cultured from materials from the airways of children with cystic fibrosis treated in the children's memorial health institute in warsaw during 1999-2002. a total of 411 samples were tested, obtained from the airways of 58 patients with diagnosed mucoviscidosis. the age of the treated patients was within the range of 1 month and 20 years. the bacteriological tests were taken during routine visits in the consultation and pulmonology clinic, which took place 3-4 times a year. the most often isolated strain was staphylococcus aureus--48%. 17% of the isolates of haemophilus influenzae and 13% of pseudomonas aeruginosa were obtained. most s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and h. infiuenzae isolates showed high susceptibility to tested antimicrobial agents. about 6% of all s. aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). s. aureus was occurring in all age groups with the same frequency. the rods h. influenzae were cultured more often from children under 10 years, while p. aeruginosa more often from older patients.
discovery of fabh/fabf inhibitors from natural products.
condensing enzymes are essential in type ii fatty acid synthesis and are promising targets for antibacterial drug discovery. recently, a new approach using a xylose-inducible plasmid to express antisense rna in staphylococcus aureus has been described; however, the actual mechanism was not delineated. in this paper, the mechanism of decreased target protein production by expression of antisense rna was investigated using northern blotting. this revealed that the antisense rna acts posttranscriptionally by targeting mrna, leading to 5' mrna degradation. using this technology, a two-plate assay was developed in order to identify fabf/fabh target-specific cell-permeable inhibitors by screening of natural product extracts. over 250,000 natural product fermentation broths were screened and then confirmed in biochemical assays, yielding a hit rate of 0.1%. all known natural product fabh and fabf inhibitors, including cerulenin, thiolactomycin, thiotetromycin, and tu3010, were discovered using this whole-cell mechanism-based screening approach. phomallenic acids, which are new inhibitors of fabf, were also discovered. these new inhibitors exhibited target selectivity in the gel elongation assay and in the whole-cell-based two-plate assay. phomallenic acid c showed good antibacterial activity, about 20-fold better than that of thiolactomycin and cerulenin, against s. aureus. it exhibited a spectrum of antibacterial activity against clinically important pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and haemophilus influenzae.
in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline, tested against 1,326 clinical bacterial strains isolated from latin america.
the in vitro activity of tigecycline (former gar-936), a new semisynthetic tetracycline, was evaluated in comparison with tetracycline and other antimicrobial agents. material and methods: a total of 1,326 contemporary clinical isolates collected from the latin american region were collected in 2000-2002 period and tested with microdilution broth according to the clsi guidelines. the bacterial pathogens evaluated included staphylococcus aureus (505), streptococcus pneumoniae (269), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 227), haemophilus influenzae (129), enterococcus spp. (80), moraxella catarrhalis (54), beta-haemolytic streptococci (28), viridans group streptococci (26), and neisseria meningitidis (8) results: tigecycline demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci, with 90% of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae strains being inhibited at 0.12 microg/ml, while the same isolates had an mic90 of > 16 microg/ml for tetracycline. all enterococcus spp. were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of tigecycline. tigecycline (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was eight-fold more potent than minocycline (mic50, 2 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (orsa); all orsa were inhibited at < 2 microg/ml of tigecycline. tigecycline demonstrated excellent activity (mic50, 0.5 microg/ml) against cons with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin (mic, 16 microg/ml). tigecycline also showed high potency against respiratory pathogens such as m. catarrhalis (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) and h. influenzae (mic50, 0.5 microg/ml). no tigecycline resistant isolates were detected when the proposed susceptible breakpoints (< 4 microg/ml) was applied. conclusions: this results indicate that tigecycline has potent in vitro activity against clinically important pathogenic bacteria, including gram-positive isolates resistant to both tetracycline and minocycline.
a comparison of a new oral streptogramin xrp 2868 with quinupristin-dalfopristin  against antibiotic-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae.
a new streptogramin antibiotic xrp 2868 was compared with quinupristin-dalfopristin for inhibitory activities against antibiotic-resistant haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in each organism examined, xrp 2868 had an ic(50) that was twofold to fivefold lower than quinupristin-dalfopristin, for inhibition of cell viability, protein synthesis, and ribosomal subunit formation.
antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of gram-positive, gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the us food and drug administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. in this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). the 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), klebsiella spp. (5.6%), s. pneumoniae (4.6%), acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.0%), escherichia coli (3.8%), serratia marcescens (2.5%), enterococcus spp. (2.3%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). at a concentration of 4 microg/ml, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, p. aeruginosa). s. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/ml. streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and s. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest mic being 0.12 microg/ml. all e. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/ml, and all klebsiella (25.8% esbl phenotype) and enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/ml. tigecycline was also active against acinetobacter spp. and s. maltophilia strains (mic50 and mic90, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively). further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
conformational constraint in oxazolidinone antibacterials. synthesis and structure-activity studies of (azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexylphenyl)oxazolidinones.
the oxazolidinones are a new class of synthetic antibacterials effective against  a broad range of pathogenic gram-positive bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant strains. linezolid is the first drug from this class to reach the market and has become an important new option for the treatment of serious infections, particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enteroccocus faecium (vre). in the search for novel oxazolidinones with improved potency and spectrum, we have prepared and evaluated the antibacterial properties of conformationally constrained analogues in which the morpholine ring of linezolid is replaced with various substituted azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl ring systems. several classes of azabicyclic analogues were identified with activity comparable or superior to that of linezolid. these include analogues bearing hydroxyl, amino, amido, or carboxyl groups on the azabicyclic ring. the azabicyclic acid analogue 50 was 4 times more potent than linezolid against key gram-positive and fastidious gram-negative pathogens (s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and e. faecalis mics < or = 1 microg/ml; haemophilus influenzae mic = 4 microg/ml).
acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: recognition and management.
acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is most common in children and has the potential to cause life-long musculoskeletal deformities. most cases are caused by staphylococcus aureus. haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) is now rare in countries that routinely use the hib vaccine. although magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred modality in localized disease, scintigraphy is often preferred as the first line of investigation because it helps to clarify the location of infection and exclude the presence of multifocal disease. where the presentation is typical, there is no underlying disease, there is a low prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus (ca-mrsa), and there is a good response to antibacterial therapy, a diagnostic bone aspirate or biopsy is not necessary. the first-line antibacterial choice in most circumstances is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin. if ca-mrsa is suspected, the first-line options include clindamycin, the addition of an aminoglycoside or, rarely, vancomycin. in most patients, the total duration of therapy can be substantially shorter than the traditional 6 weeks, and oral therapy can be commenced after a brief course of intravenous antibacterials. we recommend 3 days of intravenous therapy followed by 3 weeks of high-dose oral antibacterials, provided there is no underlying illness, the presentation is typical and acute, and there has been a good response to treatment initially. any deviation from this requires more intensive confirmation of the diagnosis (with imaging and/or biopsy or aspiration), and prolongation of intravenous therapy and total duration of treatment. close monitoring and follow-up for at least 2 years are advised to detect complications.
effect of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin and cefprozil on bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in the adenoids.
to compare the effects on the bacterial flora of the adenoids of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin or cefprozil, we enrolled in a prospective randomized study 60 children scheduled for elective adenoidectomy because of recurrent otitis media. they were randomized before surgery into 3 groups of 20 patients each: a no-therapy group, and groups with 10 days of either amoxicillin or cefprozil therapy. core adenoid materials were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and facultative bacteria. the in vitro ability of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (ahs) to inhibit the growth of non-type b haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae was determined. the number of organisms in adenoids obtained from patients treated with either antibiotic was reduced as compared to that in adenoids from controls. however, in patients treated with amoxicillin, a significant decline in the number of ahs, and an increase (in staphylococcus aureus) or no change in the number of other beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) was noted. in contrast, in those treated with cefprozil, no change was noted in the frequency of recovery of ahs, and the number of blpb decreased. interfering ahs were more often recovered in patients treated with cefprozil. we conclude that the adenoids contain more interfering ahs after therapy with a second-generation oral cephalosporin (cefprozil) than after amoxicillin therapy. this study suggests a potential beneficial effect of using an antimicrobial that selectively spares interfering ahs while inhibiting blpb.
comparative antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory tract pathogens.
bacterial respiratory tract infections (rtis), whether primary or subsequent to viral infection, are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. treatment of these infections is most often empirical. therefore, an antimicrobial's antibacterial spectrum must include the most likely pathogens: streptococcus pneumoniae, the most frequent cause of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus, as well as atypicals such as mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila and chlamydophila (chlamydia) pneumoniae. in addition, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance among these key pathogens is imperative for physicians to choose the most appropriate therapeutic agent. the latest data from global surveillance studies indicates that high-level resistance to penicillin (mic > or =2 mg/l) among isolates of s. pneumoniae varies widely by geographic location. rates exceed 20% in the usa, mexico, japan, saudi arabia, israel, spain, france, greece, hungary, and the slovak republic. in south africa, hong kong, taiwan, and south korea rates exceed 50%. penicillin non-susceptibility--including isolates exhibiting high-level resistance and intermediate susceptibility (mic 0.12-1 mg/l)--is frequently found in association with macrolide resistance, which is found at a prevalence of 70-80% in some asian countries. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx) and tetracycline resistance, either individually or combined with macrolide resistance as multiple resistance, is also associated with reduced susceptibility to penicillin. another concern about antimicrobial resistance in respiratory tract pathogens is beta-lactamase production among isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. however, respiratory fluoroquinolones, of which levofloxacin has been available for the longest time, currently remain active against the great majority of common bacterial respiratory pathogens, including atypicals.
in vitro activity of tigecycline (gar-936) tested against 11,859 recent clinical  isolates associated with community-acquired respiratory tract and gram-positive cutaneous infections.
tigecycline is a novel 9-t-butylglycylamido derivative of minocycline that has demonstrated activity against a variety of bacterial pathogens, including resistant isolates, during preclinical studies. in vitro activities of tigecycline and comparators were tested against 11,859 recent (2000 and 2002) bacterial strains recovered from patients in 29 countries with community-acquired respiratory tract disease (3,317 gram-positive and -negative strains) and skin and soft tissue infections (8,542 gram-positive strains). all oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (5,077 strains; tigecycline mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (1,432 strains; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (1,585 strains; mic(90), < or =0.25 microg/ml), viridans group streptococci (212 strains; mic(90), < or =0.25-0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci (1,416 strains; mic(90), 0.25-0.5 microg/ml), beta-haemolytic streptococci (405 strains; mic(90), < or =0.25 microg/ml), beta-lactamase positive and negative haemophilus influenzae (1,220 strains; mic(90), 1 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (495 strains; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml), and neisseria meningitidis (17 strains; mic(90), < or =0.12 microg/ml) were inhibited by 2 microg/ml or less of tigecycline. whereas potency of tetracycline and doxycycline markedly dropped in various resistant organism subsets, tigecycline was unaffected with an overall mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml. these findings confirm that tigecycline maintains a truly broad spectrum like the tetracycline class while enhancing potency. it also incorporates stability to the commonly occurring tetracycline resistance mechanisms, making it an attractive candidate for continued clinical development against pathogens causing serious community-acquired respiratory tract infections, as well as cutaneous infections.
treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
objective: to investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. methods: susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the e-test method. pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. three identical studies were conducted using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. after 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. the main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. results: in vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the mic of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, lower than the mic of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for p. aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. all serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the s. aureus model and a similar decrease in the s pneumoniae and p aeruginosa models. conclusions: topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. clinical relevance trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
in vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin lb 11058 against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
lb 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a c-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a c-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. this study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of lb 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. lb 11058 was very active against streptococcus pneumoniae. the novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae. lb 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [mic(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (mic(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. among oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, lb 11058 mic results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (mic(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains lb 11058 mics varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (mic(50), 1 micro g/ml). coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an lb 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of s. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. lb 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(50), 1 micro g/ml), and bacillus spp. (mic(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against enterococcus faecium (mic(50), >64 micro g/ml) and corynebacterium spp. (mic(50), 32 micro g/ml). against gram-negative pathogens, lb 11058 showed activity against haemophilus influenzae (mic(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90), 0.25 micro g/ml), with mics not influenced by beta-lactamase production. in conclusion, lb 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
[bacteria and resistance to antibiotics in acute otitis media in paediatrics, depending on the geographical origin].
epidemiology of the bacteria responsible: acute otitis media (aom) is the most common bacterial infection in childhood below the age of 5 years. bacteria may be isolated from middle ear fluid in about two-thirds of patients. the prevalence of bacteria varies from one country to the next. the most common pathogens recovered are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae (20-50%) and less frequently moraxella catarrhalis (10%). however, several recent reports suggest an increasing rate of isolation of m. catarrhalis approaching 20%. concomitant isolation of two or more organisms occurs in up to 10% of cases. the role of group a streptococci and staphylococcus aureus in aom has decreased since the use of antibiotics. epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance: the recent spread of penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and amoxycillin resistant h. influenzae varies considerably from one country to an other and appears related to the use of antibiotics and socio-economic conditions. a follow up of bacterial epidemiology and antibiotic resistance is necessary in each region of the world to define accurate strategies of acute otitis antibiotherapy.
[antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus, and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
indole naphthyridinones as inhibitors of bacterial enoyl-acp reductases fabi and  fabk.
bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. previously we reported the development of fabi inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by x-ray crystal structure analysis, a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against fabi-containing organisms. several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a s. aureus infection model in rats. while optimizing fabi inhibitory activity, compounds 29 and 30 were identified as having low micromolar fabk inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the fabk-containing pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. the results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-acp reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.
comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
this study compared the in vitro activity of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against 381 aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens isolated from 320 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or community-acquired pneumonia. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae accounted for 54.6% of the isolates. the ertapenem mic was < or =2 mg/l for 98.4% of isolates and > or =8 mg/l for 1.0% (all methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem had the most potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and its activity against h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, all strains of which were susceptible, was not altered by beta-lactamase production. only one s. pneumoniae strain, a penicillin-resistant isolate, was resistant to ertapenem. ertapenem was highly active in vitro against pyogenic bacteria recovered from patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
discovery of aminopyridine-based inhibitors of bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi).
bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. our efforts to identify potent, selective fabi inhibitors began with screening of the glaxosmithkline proprietary compound collection, which identified several small-molecule inhibitors of staphylococcus aureus fabi. through a combination of iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure based design, one of these leads was developed into the novel aminopyridine derivative 9, a low micromolar inhibitor of fabi from s. aureus (ic(50) = 2.4 microm) and haemophilus influenzae (ic(50) = 4.2 microm). compound 9 has good in vitro antibacterial activity against several organisms, including s. aureus (mic = 0.5 microg/ml), and is effective in vivo in a s. aureus groin abscess infection model in rats. through fabi overexpressor and macromolecular synthesis studies, the mode of action of 9 has been confirmed to be inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis via inhibition of fabi. taken together, these results support fabi as a valid antibacterial target and demonstrate the potential of small-molecule fabi inhibitors for the treatment of bacterial infections.
in vitro susceptibility of new generation of antibacterial antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria.
antibiotic susceptibility of ten bacteria i.e. neisseria catarrhalis, salmonella  typhi, s. enteritidis, haemophilus influenzae, bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas fluorescence, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and e. coli to twenty antibiotics i.e. cefpirom (30 mcg), ceftriaxone (30 mcg), erythromycin (15 mcg), doxycycline (30 mcg) lomefloxacin (10 mcg), sisomicin (30 mcg), vancomycin (30 mcg), augmentin (30 mcg), ampicillin (30 mcg), cotrimoxazole (25 mcg), cefotaxime (30 mcg), chloramphenicol (30 mcg), cephalexin (30 mcg), tetracycline (30 mcg), ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), nitrofurantoin (300 mcg), nalidixic acid (30 mcg), pefloxacin (10 mcg), norfloxacin and ofloxacin (5 mcg) was studied to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of recently introduced second and third generation antibiotics. all the test strains were sensitive to pefloxacin, erythromycin, augmentin and chloramphenicol. maximum resistance to cefpirom excluding e. coli and s. typhi and co-trimoxazole except s. typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed, occasional resistance was seen against ceftriaxone, vancomycin and cefotaxime.
structure of grepafloxacin relative to activity and safety profile.
a comparison of the structure of ciprofloxacin and grepafloxacin shows that the two compounds are similar, with two exceptions: grepafloxacin has a methyl group at the 5 position and a methyl group attached to the 7-piperazinyl substituent. at the 1 position, both compounds have a cyclopropyl group, which is important for potency, but limits anaerobic activity. the methylpiperazine at position 7 in grepafloxacin is associated with its enhanced gram-positive activity and long half-life. the methyl group at r5 is also thought to enhance gram-positive activity. ciprofloxacin's piperazine group at the 7 position is associated with good gram-negative activity. grepafloxacin's gram-negative activity is comparable to that of ciprofloxacin's against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and enteric gram-negative bacilli. studies of resistance development to fluoroquinolones suggest that grepafloxacin is associated with a reduced selection of resistance in staphylococcus aureus, which is possibly related to the inhibition or avoidance of efflux transport by nora.
in vitro activity of the new ketolide abt-773 against community acquired respiratory tract isolates and viridans streptococci.
a total of 230 isolates were collected from clinical specimens of patients attending five health centers of the buenos aires, argentina. abt-773 was compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clindamycin against bacterial isolates responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections and viridans streptococci showing different resistance patterns. time-kill curves were also performed against selected resistant isolates. all but one of the 105 pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to abt-773. among the erythromycin resistant s. pyogenes isolates, all the m type and inducible isolates were susceptible to abt-773. abt-773 showed excellent activity against macrolide, azalide, lincosamide (mal) inducible s. aureus producers but was inactive against constitutive producers. abt-773 activity against viridans streptococci was also excellent.abt-773 exerted bactericidal activity against selected isolates of s. pneumoniae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae, however, it was only bacteriostatic against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus.
in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
[current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ent-infections].
in bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. s. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. to decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ent-infections is necessary. the new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. in more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. in more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are widely used and effective. ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). a dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ent-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.
cefditoren pivoxil.
cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were determined. the minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. the antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). the clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. one strain of haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. in one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of gar-936 tested against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive blood stream infection isolates and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
gar-936, a new, semisynthetic glycylcycline, has shown good antibacterial activity against a wide range of clinically important gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. the purpose of this study was to determine the activity of gar-936 against a range of gram-positive and -negative bloodstream isolates including many strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). six hundred four bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci collected as part of the sentry surveillance program were selected for their geographic diversity. gar-936 was also tested against an additional 176 gram-negative cocci isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 98 strains; escherichia coli, 78 strains), 96 of which were esbl-producers. broth microdilution testing was used to determine the susceptibility of the selected organisms and a range of comparator antimicrobial agents whose choice was based on their activities against the selected pathogens and included a mix of both newer and older agents. presence of an esbl-producing strain was confirmed using the clavulanate test. gar-936 demonstrated impressive activity against all 604 strains of gram-positive cocci, with an mic range of <or=0.015-1 microg/ml, and mic(90)s ranging from <or=0.05 microg/ml for s. pneumoniae to 0.25 for s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. mics against the 176 gram-negative isolates were higher (range 0.06-4 microg/ml), with mic(90)s of 0.25-1 microg/ml. the activity of gar-936 was relatively unaffected by the presence of esbls. the activity of gar-936 was particularly impressive against gram-positive cocci when compared against the test results for vancomycin and the newer antimicrobial agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic(90)s for gar-936 were significantly lower than the comparator agents for all species tested with particularly impressive results against s. pneumoniae and enterococci.
in vitro evaluation of bi 397, a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent.
bi 397, a semi-synthetic amide derivative of the experimental glycopeptide, mdl 62,476 (a40926), has excellent in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive organisms. in this extensive study, 630 contemporary (1998-2000) gram-positive isolates were selected from various resistance surveillance studies for their resistance patterns to fluoroquinolones, macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins, beta-lactams and glycopeptide agents. the bi 397 spectrum of activity was similar to that of other glycopeptides with a mic90 of < or =0.5 microg/ml for all tested isolates with the exception of vancomycin-resistant enterococci van a; (mic90, 32 microg/ml). bi 397 was more potent than vancomycin and teicoplanin against staphylococcus aureus (2- to 8-fold), beta-haemolytic streptococci (equal to >16-fold), viridans group streptococci (equal to >32-fold), and corynebacterium spp. including c. jeikeium (8- to >16-fold). bi 397 was also more active than quinupristin/dalfopristin against all gram-positive organisms tested with the exception of oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus, against which it had equal activity. bi 397 has little activity against haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 64 microg/ml) or other gram-negative bacilli (mic90, >64 microg/ml). bi 397 exhibited bacteriostatic activity (like the vancomycin control) versus most species, but was bactericidal against tested streptococcus pneumoniae. in vitro testing conditions with blood supplemented or free protein containing media elevated bi 397 mic results, and the 30-microg disk seems acceptable for further disk diffusion test development. animal pharmacokinetic data published elsewhere suggest that bi 397 may be dosed less frequently than teicoplanin and the results of early studies in humans are awaited with interest, especially when treating teicoplanin-refractory coagulase-negative staphylococci.
in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428 had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis in taiwan.
background: over the past decade, resistance of gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. new antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. we conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. methods: the agar dilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. results: all staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). the mic90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s aureus. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. the mic90s were 1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, s pyogenes and viridans streptococci. ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. h influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. b catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. conclusions: we found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and b catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against h influenzae.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 18 institutions around the entire japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1998 to september in 1999. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 60.0%. vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. but one of mrsa showed resistance to abk with the mic of 64 micrograms/ml. the sensitive strains of mrsa to vcm have decreased. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) + pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. but prsp decreased, and pisp increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. panipenem (papm), imipenem (ipm) and faropenem (frpm) showed the most potent activities against s. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. against h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) decreased in 1997, but those have increased in 1998. inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (ctm) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were active against k. pneumoniae. a quite few of k. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. the ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70 years compared with the results in 1997. chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 26.7%, h. influenzae 23.8%, s. aureus 13.3% and m. (b.) catarrhalis 10.8%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. the frequencies of s. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days. the frequencies of h.

antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, gar-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
in vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems j-111, 225, j-114,870, and j-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the c-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. among isolates of both methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcons), 90% were inhibited by j-111,347 (prototype), j-111,225, j-114,870, and j-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an mic(90) of 128 microgram/ml. although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had mic(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml for mrsa and mrcons, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. the potent anti-mrsa activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of mrsa. since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile, as well as mrsa, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
[in vitro activity of pristinamycin on respiratory bacteria].
two-phase action: pristinamycin is composed of two active substances a and b. pristinamycin a (sa) first binds to the ribosome subunit 50s. pristinamycin b (sb) then locks onto sa causing irreversible inhibition of bacterial protein production. well-adapted activity spectrum: a member of the streptogramin family of antibiotics, pristinamycin is active against the main bacteria causing respiratory tract infections (pneumococci, s. aureus, h. influenzae) as well as against mycoplasma and anaerobic pathogens. anti-pneumococci activity: minimal inhibitory concentrations measured over the last 5 years have confirmed that the antibacterial activity of pristinamycin against pneumococci remains unchanged even for strains which develop resistance to other antibiotics, particularly to penicillin or erythromycin. other bacteria: the activity of pristinamycin against h. influenzae is a constant finding (unimodal distribution of mic). the persistent of pristinamycin activity against s. aureus strains, excepting a few sa- resistant strains and sa + sb- resistant strains, is remarkable. mic studies have also demonstrated the constant susceptibility of moraxella catarrhalis, non-groupable streptococci, anaerobic bacteria, and legionella pneumophila.
on the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol.
secoiridoides (oleuropein and derivatives), one of the major classes of polyphenol contained in olives and olive oil, have recently been shown to inhibit or delay the rate of growth of a range of bacteria and microfungi but there are no data in the literature concerning the possible employment of these secoiridoides as antimicrobial agents against pathogenic bacteria in man. in this study five atcc standard bacterial strains (haemophilus influenzae atcc 9006, moraxella catarrhalis atcc 8176, salmonella typhi atcc 6539, vibrio parahaemolyticus atcc 17802 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923) and 44 fresh clinical isolates (haemophilus influenzae, eight strains, moraxella catarrhalis, six strains, salmonella species, 15 strains, vibrio cholerae, one strain, vibrio alginolyticus, two strains, vibrio parahaemolyticus, one strain, staphylococcus aureus, five penicillin-susceptible strains and six penicillin-resistant strains), causal agents of intestinal or respiratory tract infections in man, were tested for in-vitro susceptibility to two olive (olea europaea) secoiridoides, oleuropein (the bitter principle of olives) and hydroxytyrosol (derived from oleuropein by enzymatic hydrolysis and responsible for the high stability of olive oil). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) calculated in our study are evidence of the broad antimicrobial activity of hydroxytyrosol against these bacterial strains (mic values between 0.24 and 7.85 microg ml(-1) for atcc strains and between 0.97 and 31.25 microg ml(-1) for clinically isolated strains). furthermore oleuropein also inhibited (although to a much lesser extent) the growth of several bacterial strains (mic values between 62.5 and 500 microg ml(-1) for atcc strains and between 31.25 and 250 microg ml(-1) for clinical isolates); oleuropein was ineffective against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. these data indicate that in addition to the potential employment of its active principles as food additives or in integrated pest-management programs, olea europaea can be considered a potential source of promising antimicrobial agents for treatment of intestinal or respiratory tract infections in man.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in these 17 institutions around the entire japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october in 1997 to september in 1998. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus: mrsa) accounted for 55.0%. the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. arbekacin (abk) and vancomycin (vcm) showed the most potent activities against mrsa. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml against s. pneumoniae. the frequency of penicillin (pc)-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp)+pc-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. against h. influenzae and m.(b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. but the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (caz) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. meropenem (mepm), ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). and tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). all drugs except ampicillin (abpc) were more active against k. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. the examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. about the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. the tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. the increase of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: s. pneumoniae 24.5%, h. influenzae 21.4%, s. aureus 18.4% and p. aeruginosa 12.2%. the frequencies of s. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was not affected. the frequencies of p. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. from patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. s. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in infancy: effects of age, gender, season, viral upper respiratory tract infection and sleeping position.
the aim of the investigation was to determine the effect of age, gender, viral upper respiratory tract infection (urti), season and sleeping position on the composition of the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in infancy. seventy-two babies, 38 male and 34 female, whose birthdates were evenly spread throughout the year were followed from birth to 18 months of age. from 0 to 6 months nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained once a month in periods without urti and daily for 3 days during episodes of urti. from 12 to 18 months of age nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained in the early morning alter an overnight sleep and later in the day after the baby had been up for over 2 h. swabs were obtained in prone and supine sleepers with and without infection. in infants aged 0-6 months urti had little effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora, but there was a marked effect of age and less marked effect of season and gender. in particular staphylococcus aureus carriage decreased with age, was most common in the winter months and the density of colonisation was greater in males than females. in infants aged 12-18 months the combination of prone sleeping with urti and an early morning swab led to increased carriage of staphylococci, streptococci. haemophilus influenzae and gram-negative bacilli which are not normally part of the nasopharyngeal flora. these results are relevant to sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the combination of prone sleeping and urti reproduces the nasopharyngeal flora seen in sids. gram-negative bacilli isolated from sids cases should not be dismissed as post-mortem contaminants. the features of s. aureus make it a prime candidate for a pathogenic role in sids.
spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.
[basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
a drug susceptibility test of the combination drug taz/pipc, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (taz), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (pipc), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. the clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. the results were as follows: 1. in susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, taz/pipc, pipc, penicillin g (pcg), ampicillin (abpc), cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz). of three clinically isolated species from patients, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was treated with taz/pipc, pipc, methicillin (dmppc), ctm, ctx, and sbt/cpz, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for dmppc. the mics were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic90 values of taz/pipc against 45 strains of streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctm, caz, and sbt/cpz. the mics of taz/pipc for 28 strains of streptococcus agalactiae (s. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctm, caz, and sbt/cpz. as for gram-negative bacilli, the mic90 of taz/pipc against 10 strains of bordetella pertussis (b. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc. the mic90 of taz/pipc against 31 strains of haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctx, and sbt/cpz. regarding gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the mic90 of taz/pipc against 2 strains of s. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of pipc, dmppc, ctm, and ctx, and the latter was similar to those of pipc, dmppc, ctx, and sbt/cpz. of 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of pipc, sbt/cpz. as for gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of h. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. the mics of taz/pipc against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of pipc and sbt/cpz. while the mic of taz/pipc against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of sbt/cpz and smaller than that of pipc. 2. the results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: taz/pipc was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). no case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). biochemical profile showed an increase in gpt alone and abnormal increases in both got and gpt in 1 each out of 21 cases.
bacterial pathogens (non-mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
sputum culture of patients at siriraj hospital, bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. the average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. the most common gram-negative rod was pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either klebsiella pneumoniae or acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. the most common coccus was staphylococcus aureus. from both years, the number of haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. for antimicrobial susceptibility, p. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). s. aureus (mssa) was sensitive to common used drugs. s. aureus (mrsa) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.
[in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
cs-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. this compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite r-95867. the antibacterial activity of r-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. r-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the bacterial species tested. r-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, clostridium perfringens, neisseria spp., moraxella catarrhalis, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae (mic at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). r-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteroides fragilis. r-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and escherichia coli. penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of s. aureus and 1bs, 2, 3, and 4 of e. coli had high affinities for r-95867. the in vivo efficacy of cs-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. the efficacy of cs-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, e. coli, citrobacter freundii, and proteus vulgaris. among the drugs tested, cs-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-940, a new fluoroquinolone, against isolates from patients with respiratory infections.
we compared the in vivo and in vitro activities of cs-940, a new fluoroquinolone, with those of a group of other drugs. the activities of cs-940 against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, were comparable to those of tosufloxacin, with mics at which 90% of the strains were inhibited (mic90s) of 0.5 microg/ml or less. against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cs-940 was as active as tosufloxacin, with a mic90 of 16 microg/ml. the efficacy of cs-940 against murine respiratory infections due to s. pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae was better than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin. the efficacy of oral doses of cs-940 reflected not only potent in vitro activity but also a high transmigration ratio from the bloodstream to lung tissues.
in vitro activity of trimethoprim alone compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species associated with upper respiratory tract infections.
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used to treat various respiratory tract infections. nevertheless, for many patients, intolerance of the sulfonamide component precludes use of this combination. this study examined the activity of trimethoprim alone in comparison to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species implicated in respiratory tract infections. for haemophilus influenzae, minimal inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim were equal to or one dilution greater than those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with 56 of 58 strains inhibited by the former at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. all oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 96.7% of streptococcus pyogenes were inhibited by trimethoprim < or = 2 micrograms/ml. in contrast, only 50% of streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by this concentration of trimethoprim, whereas 93.3% were susceptible to the combination at < or = 2/38 micrograms/ml. all oxacillin-resistant s. aureus and all moraxella catarrhalis were resistant to trimethoprim, although many of the former and all of the latter were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
in vitro evaluation of bo-3482, a novel dithiocarbamate carbapenem with activity  against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
bo-3482, a dithiocarbamate carbapenem, inhibited clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mrs) at 6.25 microg/ml (mic at which 90% of isolates tested are inhibited [mic90]), while the mic90 of imipenem was > 100 microg/ml. bo-3482 was generally less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacteria, although bo-3482 showed better activity (mic90) than imipenem against enterococcus faecium, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, and clostridium difficile. the affinities (50% inhibitory concentrations) of bo-3482 for penicillin-binding protein (pbp) pbp 2' of mrs and pbp 5 of e. faecium (both pbps have low affinities for ordinary beta-lactam antibiotics) were 3.8 and 20 microg/ml, respectively, reflecting the greater activity of bo-3482 against mrs than against e. faecium.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and mic quality control guidelines of rpr 106972  (rpr 112808/rpr106950): a novel orally administered streptogramin combination. the quality control study group.
rpr 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. mics for rpr 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. rpr 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by rpr 106972 (mic90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), rpr 106972 was highly active with mic results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. rpr 106972 inhibited corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 2 micrograms/ml). rpr 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to enterococcus faecium (mic90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other enterococcus ssp. (mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml; and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.
antibacterial activity of trovafloxacin against nosocomial gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
a total of 1132 clinical isolates from 952 patients with nosocomial infections were tested against the fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin by the agar dilution method. they comprised 285 staphylococci, 111 streptococci, 94 enterococci and 470 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, 92 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 28 haemophilus influenzae and 25 acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside agents. over 96% of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to trovafloxacin with an mic of <0.03-4 mg/l. it also inhibited 97% and 100% clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia, respectively. all staphylococci, including 51 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were susceptible to trovafloxacin, which also had excellent activity against streptococci and enterococci, inhibiting all 111 strains of the former and 94% of the latter. trovafloxacin had a greater activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria than ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, penicillins, cephalosporins and the aminoglycosides tested.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
the bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 567 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from october 1995 to september 1996. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin (mpipc) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. arbekacin (abk) showed the most highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 micrograms/ml. vancomycin (vcm) showed the next highest activity with mic80 of 1 microgram/ml. these drugs showed the high activities against mrsa with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) s. pneumoniae. most of drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefotaxime (ctx), cefmenoxime (cmx) and cefpirome (cpr) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with mic80s of 0.25 microgram/ml. erythromycin (em) and clindamycin (cldm) showed low activities with mic80s 128 micrograms/ml or high. among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae test with all mics at 4 micrograms/ml or below. cefotiam (ctm), cmx, cefditoren (cdtr) and ofloxacin (oflx) showed the most potent activity with mic90s to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) p. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) ipm and tobramycin (tob) showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs) and carumonam (crmn) showed next potent activity, with mic80s of 2 micrograms/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tob and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) showed the most potent activities against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80s of 1 microgram/ml. the mic80 of ampicillin (abpc) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) k. pneumoniae. all drugs except abpc were active against k. pneumoniae. cpr and crmn showed the most potent activities against k. pneumoniae with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. the mic80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) m. (b.) catarrhalis. against m. (b.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with mic80s at 4 micrograms/ml or below. and mics of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below. ipm, oflx and minocycline (mino) showed the most potent activity with mic80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. the examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. proportion of differe
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of er-35786, a new antipseudomonal  carbapenem.
er-35786 is a new parenteral 1 beta-methyl carbapenem with a broad antibacterial  spectrum and a potent antipseudomonal activity. it showed high in vitro activity, comparable to those of meropenem and a new carbapenem, bo-2727, against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, with mics at which 90% of strains tested are inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, er-35786 was the most active among the compounds tested, yet its mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae, er-35786 inhibited 90% of strains tested at a concentration of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. the mic90 of er-35786 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 3.13 micrograms/ml, and the compound was more active than meropenem. in addition, the activity of er-35786 against imipenem-, meropenem-, cefclidin-, or ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa was equal to or higher than that of the most active reference compound. the in vivo activity of er-35786 was consistent with this in vitro activity. the in vivo activity of er-35786 was highest for systemic infection models with methicillin-resistant s. aureus and beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa strains. in acute pneumonia caused by p. aeruginosa, er-35786 produced a greater reduction in the viable cell count in the lungs than did imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem.
epidemiological factors influencing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
antimicrobial resistance is becoming an important public health problem for both  hospital- and community-acquired infections. in the hospital, infections caused by drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, enterococci, and a variety of gram-negative rods are resulting in increased morbidity, mortality and costs, in part because of prolonged hospitalization and the use of more expensive antimicrobial agents. drug-resistant, community-acquired infections are also causing important problems in both the developed and the developing world. although the relative importance of specific pathogens varies with the geographical area, community-acquired pathogens including salmonella, shigella, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae are causing both sporadic cases and outbreaks of drug-resistant illness. the emergence of antimicrobial resistance is being attributed to a series of societal, technological, environmental and microbial changes. these include increasing populations of susceptible hosts, international travel and commerce, changes in technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and the breakdown of public health measures. addressing emerging problems and antimicrobial resistance will require enhanced surveillance, prudent use of existing antimicrobial drugs, development of new antimicrobial agents, increased emphasis on infection control and hygienic practices, effective disease control programs, better use of existing vaccines, and development of more and better vaccines.
antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime in vitro.
cefpodoxime proxetil is a new orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third-generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, and which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method, we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and quinolones against 637 recent clinical isolates from kaohsiung veterans general hospital in taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefpodoxime showed excellent activity, inhibiting over 90% of these isolates at 1 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparative drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefpodoxime showed moderate activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas it was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. however, all cephalosporins have shown little in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus regardless of in vitro results. cefpodoxime was inactive against enterococcus spp. against other streptococci, its activity was similar to other oral cephalosporins and quinolones tested. the results of this in vitro study indicated that oral administration of cefpodoxime should be an ideal agent in the empirical outpatient treatment for community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
the in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (cp 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. bay 12-8039 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [mic90s] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for serratia spp. mic90 2 microgram/ml), neisseria spp. (mic90s, 0.015 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but bay 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. strains of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to bay 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. bay 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus auerus (mic90s, 0.12 micrograms/ml). the activity of bay 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. bay 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (mic90s < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against bacteroides fragilis, prevotella spp., and clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. against mycobacterium tuberculosis, bay 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (mics < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). against chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae bay 12-8039 was more active (mics < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. the protein binding of bay 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. the presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of bay 12-8039.
a multinational european survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
the antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five european countries. in terms of both mic90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against mycoplasma catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of mic90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. in many cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. however, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. the findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.
comparative antimicrobial activity and post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against some respiratory pathogens.
recent macrolide derivatives, roxithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin show more favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison to old ones and some differences in antibacterial activity. with the aim of improving our understanding of some aspects of their action against respiratory pathogens, we determined the mics and mbcs of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was the most active agent against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, while clarithromycin was more active against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus with mics similar to those of erythromycin. the bactericidal activity of all tested derivatives was weak against staphylococcus aureus (mbc/mic ratio approximately 16) and against moraxella catarrhalis (mbc/mic ratio, 8-16), but good against staphylococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mbc/mic ratio, 2-4). the determination of killing curves in the presence of 2 mic and 10 mic of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin confirmed their weak bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus and moraxella catarrhalis as well as their effective activity against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. azithromycin showed the highest bactericidal activity against haemophilus influenzae. as expected, the three derivatives produced a quite prolonged pae when exposed to 5 mic for 1 h, ranging between 2-4 h. the bactericidal activity and the prolonged pae of new macrolides for the most common respiratory pathogens should assure a good clinical activity in respiratory infections including those sustained by haemophilus influenzae, which is less susceptible to erythromycin and other old macrolides.
[study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. part 2. an analysis of factors that prescribe for the prognosis].
underlying diseases, complications, clinical findings, and laboratory findings were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to jikei university hospital from 1975 to 1994, in order to conjectured factors that prescribe for the prognosis. 50% of the patients had underlying diseases. malignancy including leukaemia (31 cases, 39.2%) was the most common underlying disease, followed by low birth weight infant (17 cases, 21.5%), aplastic anemia (9 case, 11.4%), and congenital heart disease (7 cases, 8.9%). the death rate for patients with underlying disease (27.8%) was significantly greater than the mortality for normal patients with septicaemia (8.9%) (p < 0.05). meningitis (24.7%) was the most common complication, followed by dic (19.6%), shock (15.2%), and pneumonia (10.8%). the mortality rate of septicaemia complicated by shock was 66.7% (p < 0.01), and that complicated by dic was 45.2% (p < 0.01). the mortality rate for patients with the clinical findings of respiratory distress, cough, abdominal distention, cyanosis, splenomegaly, or peripheral coldness was more than 40% and significantly greater (p < 0.01). mortality rate in patients with granulocyte counts of < 4.000/mm3, platelet counts of < 5 x 10(4)/ mm3, total protein of < 5.0 g/dl, or esr of < 20 mm/hr were significantly greater (p < 0.01) than those in patients with normal laboratory findings. coincidence rate of blood and stool cultures was 57.9% for e. coli, and 28.6% for klebsiella sp., and that of blood and throat cultures was more than 30% for pseudomonas sp., haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. in the study of antimicrobial susceptibility for microorganisms isolated, the number of drug resistant s. aureus had increased in the last 10 years.
[susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout japan, since 1981. ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. results obtained from these investigations are discussed. in 23 institutions around the entire japan, 492 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from october 1994 to september 1995. mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. s. aureus. s. aureus strains for which mics of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. vancomycin showed the highest activity against s. aureus with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. s. pneumoniae. most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against s. pneumoniae. imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with mic80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with mic80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with mics of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. h. influenzae. the activities of all drugs were potent against h. influenzae tested. cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the mics of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with mic of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with mic80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their mic80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). tobramycin showed the most potent activity against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with mic80 of 2 micrograms/ml. comparing to the activities against p. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against p. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. k. pneumoniae. carumonam showed the most potent activity against k. pneumoniae with mic80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with mic80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their mic80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their mics were all higher than > or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. m. (b.) catarrhalis. imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, their mic80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their mic80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
antibacterial activity of cefprozil in vitro.
cefprozil is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against 637 recent clinical isolates from the kaohsiung veterans general hospital, taiwan. against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, cefprozil showed good activity, inhibiting over 80% of these isolates at 8 mg/l. like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. against haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, cefprozil showed high activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, its activity was higher than that of other oral cephalosporins tested and was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. of enterococci tested, 57.7% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefprozil. against beta-hemolytic streptococci, its activity was superior to all other drugs tested. the results of this in vitro study indicate that oral administration of cefprozil might be efficacious in the treatment of community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem wy-49605 (sun5555) against recent clinical isolates from five u.s. medical centers.
the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at 2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.
antimicrobial activity of sm-17466, a novel carbapenem antibiotic with potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-17466, a new 1 beta-methyl carbapenem, were evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isoaltes and compared with the activities of meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin. sm-17466 had a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive bacteria, showing especially potent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. the mics of sm-17466, meropenem, imipenem, vancomycin, and arbekacin at which 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were inhibited were 3.13, 50, 100, 1.56, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. this activity of sm-17466 was almost equivalent to those of the antibiotics used for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. sm-17466 also showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. in contrast, sm-17466 was less active against gram-negative bacteria, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with the other carbapenems; however, of the carbapenems, sm-17466 exhibited the highest activity against haemophilus influenzae and bacteriodes fragilis. sm-17466, at a 50% inhibitory concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml, bound to penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 4 in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and also had good binding to penicillin-binding protein 2' in a methicillin-resistant strain (50% inhibitory concentration, 5.9 micrograms/ml). this high affinity, which was 10 and 20 times greater than those for meropenem and imipenem, respectively, was reflected in the potent activity of sm-17466 against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. sm-17466 demonstrated excellent in vivo efficacy against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus strains in a mouse peritoneal infection model: the efficacy of sm-17466 against methicillin-resistant strains was equal to or one-third that of vancomycin. this activity was comparable to the in vitro activity of sm-17466. the subcutaneous injection of sm-17466 in mice revealed that the half-life of sm-17466 in serum was about 18 min, intermediate between those of vancomycin and arbekacin and 1.5-fold that of imipenem-cilastatin. sm-17466 was resistant to hydrolysis by swine renal dehydropeptidase i, to an extent comparable to the resistance shown by meropenem.
antibiotic susceptibility of the sputum pathogens and throat swab pathogens isolated from the patients undergoing treatment in twenty-one private clinics in japan.
bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and 891 were gram-negative. major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pnuemoniae and s. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. new quinolones and new generation cephems were active against h. influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. only one strain of s. aureus was methicillin-resistant. as regards other pathogens, 6.5% of s. pneumoniae and 14.9% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. mrsa was found infrequently. but ampicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.
persistent acute otitis media: ii. antimicrobial treatment.
in this three-year prospective study, 137 children with acute otitis media (aom)  that had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent aom) underwent tympanocentesis to determine additional antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolate(s). one hundred eleven children with aom not previously treated are described for comparison. in the persistent aom group middle ear aspirates grew streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), haemophilus influenzae (7%), brahamella catarrhalis (7%), streptococcus pyogenes (6%), staphylococcus aureus (5%), two pathogens (3%) or no bacterial growth (49%); pathogens in previously untreated aom were similar but fewer patients (30%) had no bacterial growth. after tympanocentesis additional antimicrobial therapy for persistent aom patients utilizing drugs shown to be effective in vitro against the isolated pathogen failed to produce clinical resolution of infection in 27 (28%) of ears. differing clinical efficacy was observed with various antimicrobials: amoxicillin (57% failure); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75% failure); cefaclor (37% failure); cefixime (23% failure); amoxicillin/clavulanate (12% failure); and cefuroxime axetil (13% failure). presumptive clinical cure for previously untreated aom patients was similar to that for untreated aom except for fewer amoxicillin failures (30%). we conclude that clinical failure in persistent aom occurs (1) even when no pathogen is isolated from tympanocentesis (50% of patients) and (2) despite demonstrated in vitro activity against culture-proved pathogens.
antibiotic susceptibility tests with fastidious and nonfastidious bacterial reference strains: effects of aerobic versus hypercapnic incubation.
representative antimicrobial drugs were examined under aerobic and hypercapnic (3 and 5% v/v co2) incubation with the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion, a broth microdilution method, and the agar dilution procedure against nonfastidious, standard atcc quality control strains and against two beta-hemolytic streptococcal, two pneumococcal, and three haemophilus influenzae atcc strains. it was found that an atmosphere of 3-5% co2 merely antagonized amikacin, gentamicin, and netilmicin; the activity of penicillin g was antagonized only against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 in broth media, but not against any of the other strains. the activity of teicoplanin, and less so that of vancomycin, was enhanced only against s. aureus strain atcc 25923, but not against the other strains. it was concluded that susceptibility tests, excluding aminoglycoside antibiotics, of beta-hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, and h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae should be incubated under 3% (candle jar or incubator) or 5% co2 (incubator) so as to ensure optimal growth of capnephilic strains and thus avoid potentially misleading large inhibition zones of deceptively low minimal inhibitory concentrations.
[multiresistant bacteria in a scandinavian perspective].
the global increase in multiresistant bacteria may herald the end of the antibiotic era. recently, the most ominous sign has been the increasing resistance in pneumococci, enterococci and staphylococcus aureus, as this has not been met with new effective antimicrobials. resistant haemophilus influenzae and meningococci are potential future problems. except for the occurrence of multiresistant pneumococci in iceland, hitherto the nordic countries have largely escaped these problems, though multiresistant enterococci are being isolated with increasing frequency and penicillin-resistant pneumococci have become endemic in southern sweden. concerted action is needed in an attempt to halt the increasing resistance among important bacterial pathogens.
trends in antimicrobial resistance among today's bacterial pathogens.
resistance of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem with significant clinical consequences. microbiologic surveillance data, such as those provided by the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, supply information on current nosocomial pathogens in the united states. many species show resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and, in many cases, it is emerging resistance. resistance in many gram-negative bacteria is caused by beta-lactamase production. escherichia coli, the leading nosocomial pathogen, is capable of hyperproducing tem-1 beta-lactamase. a novel form of resistance in klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli is caused by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. many enterobacteriaceae can be induced to produce group 1 beta-lactamase by exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. thirty percent of haemophilus influenzae isolates are resistant to ampicillin because of beta-lactamase production. issues of concern in gram-positive species include multiple antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and increasing beta-lactam resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. to minimize the development of resistance, antimicrobials must be administered judiciously, and infection-control practices must be instituted and followed.
[fundamental and clinical studies of sy5555 in pediatrics].
we assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of sy5555 in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. in vitro antibacterial activities of sy5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn). against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, sy5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. in cases of gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 against haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn. against klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of sy5555 was less potent than that of cpdx. 2. forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with sy5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). the clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases) and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. the palatability of sy5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. from the above results, sy5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sy5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sy5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. the following results were obtained. 1. antibacterial activities. mics of sy5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn) were determined against clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) cfu/ml. mics of sy5555 against s. aureus, cns, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, e. coli and e. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. although the effects of sy 5555 against h. influenzae and e. coli were slightly inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. absorption and excretion in this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of sy5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. with both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. the plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. the half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. the urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. clinical results the clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. the treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of sy5555. the effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone cp-99,219.
the in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone cp-99,219 [7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)naphthyridone] was compared with those of four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of many isolates in the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml (range, < 0.008 to 1 microgram/ml), an activity comparable to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin and two times greater than that of temafloxacin. ninety percent of the proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms of cp-99,219 per ml. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae isolates at 1 and 0.015 micrograms/ml, respectively. the compound inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at 0.06 micrograms/ml, whereas a ciprofloxacin concentration of 1 microgram/ml was required to inhibit these organisms. cp-99,219 inhibited 90% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates at a concentration of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin had mics against these isolates of > 16 micrograms/ml. streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of tosufloxacin. cp-99,219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae. bacteroides species were inhibited by cp-99,219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4- and 16-microgram/ml concentrations of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the mbcs of cp-99,219 ranged from two to four times the mics, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on mic. cp-99,219 was active against p. aeruginosa at ph 5.5, with only a fourfold increase in mic compared with values obtained at ph 7.5. the addition of up to 9 mm mg(2+) increased the mic range from 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml to 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. in view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, cp-99,219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use.
[pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
cefozopran (czop, sce-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. we determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients. 1. antibacterial activity mics of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and czop were determined against a total of 19 strains. for gram-positive cocci, mics of czop ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against staphylococcus aureus (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (5 strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). these mics were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the mic of czop against e. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. for gram-negative bacilli, mics of czop were 25 micrograms/ml against citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). these values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, mics of czop against haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the mic of czop against serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and czop was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. pharmacokinetics czop was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) using the bioassay. serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. the corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the aucs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4 and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. the rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg, and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. the concentrations in the csf determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the csf/serum concentration ratio ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. these values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using hplc. 3. clinical evaluation forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. of these patients, 75% were less than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the in-vitro activity of fk-037, a new broad spectrum injectable cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of the parenteral cephem fk-037 was compared to those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav. against the enterobacteriaceae fk-037 was generally > or = 16-fold more active than cefuroxime and two- to four-fold more active than ceftazidime and similar in activity to cefpirome. pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed similar susceptibilities to ceftazidime and fk-037 (mic90 4 and 8 mg/l respectively). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by < or = 4 mg/l of fk-037. the mic of fk-037 for 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/l. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/l fk-037.
evaluation of opc-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
the antibacterial activity of opc-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. the pharmacokinetic profiles of opc-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. opc-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. opc-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. the mics of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant s. aureus and p. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. the in vitro antibacterial activity of opc-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. opc-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, h. influenzae, and m. catarrhalis. in comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of opc-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. opc-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. this excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.
evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of minocycline (mino) and that of cefuzonam (czon) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. mino was highly active against methicilli-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, flavobacterium meningosepticum, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, peptostreptococcus spp. and propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. czon was highly active against mssa, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, n. gonorrhoeae, m(b). catarrhalis, h. influenzae, h. pylori, p. mirabilis, peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes, but not effective against mrsa. it was minimally active against gram-negative rods (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens. fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.
minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various national committee for clinical laboratory standards susceptibility test methods. quality control study group.
several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (qc) giudelines. replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended qc strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. in addition qc mic ranges, using appropriate medium modification for haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226 were reported on four (du-6859a, fk-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and fk-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.
[in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates. beta-lactamase study group in chubu-area].
antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates from 1986 to 1991 except 1988 were determined. beta-lactamase was detected frequently in escherichia coli (84.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (65.4%), staphylococcus aureus (62.3%), and not frequently in haemophilus influenzae (22.4%). methicillin-resistant s. aureus was also resistant to many antimicrobials except to arbekacin and minocycline, and imipenem showed markedly high activity against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus. susceptibilities of e. coli and k. pneumoniae to cefuzonam, imipenem and ofloxacin were quite high and that of h. influenzae to ofloxacin and cefuzonam was also very high.
antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
in vitro brodimoprim activity on bacterial strains.
the antibacterial activity of brodimoprim (bdp) was compared to that of trimethoprim (tmp) and to 4 other antibiotics (3 beta-lactams and one macrolide). the 237 tested strains were selected predominantly among bacteria isolated from respiratory tract infections: 133 gram-negative bacilli and 98 gram-positive cocci. the study included: determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of all antibiotics of the study for all isolates; kinetics of bactericidal activities for selected susceptible strains; correlation between mics and inhibition zones (standard agar diffusion technique) of bdp (regression line). the results of the study showed: [1] no significant difference between in vitro activities of bdp and tmp against all tested strains; [2] low mics of both drugs for haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus (methi-s and methi-r), streptococcus pneumoniae (peni-s), streptococci and enterococci; [3] kinetics of bactericidal activities indicating 4 log decrease of inoculum size with bdp for staph. aureus, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, within 7 hours; [4] correlation was established between inhibition zones and mics of bdp, with a coefficient of correlation r = 0.88 for 182 strains. in conclusion, bdp exhibited in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activities at least equal to that of reference drugs against most respiratory pathogens; bdp was superior to comparators against methi-r staphylococci and enterococci.
[efficacy of fibronectin on opsonic activity by alveolar macrophage and experimental rat pneumonia].
the opsonic activity of plasma fibronectin (fn) by rat alveolar macrophage (am) was examined, and the in vivo effect of fn in staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) experimental rat pneumonia was evaluated. the chemiluminescence response of am was enhanced by the presence of fn (300 micrograms/ml) in s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, but was not enhanced in gram-negative rods (haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa). fn (300 micrograms/ml) promoted the phagocytosis of s. aureus by am, but did not promote the bactericidal activity of that by am. in the experimental rat pneumonia with s. aureus inoculation, plasma fn concentration decreased with time, but increased by the administration of fn (1 mg). the number of bacteria in the lung, peripheral white blood cell and bal fluid cell also decreased by the administration of fn. furthermore, fn was significantly improved on inflammatory findings of rat lung tissue 24 hours after inoculation with s. aureus. these results suggest that fn plays an important role as an opsonic by alveolar macrophage, and that fn has utility for clinical trials in patients with pneumonia.
[antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
the antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (aspc) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (mics) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (pcs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. the mic80's of aspc against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. a trend for increasing susceptibility to pcs including aspc was observed in the isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus influenzae. this trend in s. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of mrsa. the trend for the increased susceptibility in h. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. the frequency of the strains highly resistant to pcs including aspc increased. 4. no pcs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to pcs or those with resistant to pcs. these strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). meanwhile, a high frequency of highly pcs-resistant strains were noted among enterococcus faecium. in view of the fact that the pcs-resistance of e. faecium is known to be related to pbps, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
[clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (cfpz, bmy-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. cfpz was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute uti, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. the effectiveness rate was 96.4%. bacteriologically, 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-streptococcus, 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of salmonella c2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. the bacteriological eradication rates for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against gram-positive bacteria. no side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. as abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. in conclusion, cfpz was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
in vitro activity of ru 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester hr 916.
the in vitro activity of ru 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. the mics of ru 29246 for 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested (mic90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). ru 29246 was active against staphylococcus aureus (mic90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). streptococci and neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to ru 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. ru 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem-1 and shv-1). however, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9) was detected. results of the study suggested that ru 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. spanish collaborative group.
the activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups c, g and f, brucella melitensis, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against campylobacter spp. in general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. clarithromycin was bactericidal against streptococcus spp. and haemophilus influenzae.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of e1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the in vitro activities of e1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic of e1077 for 90% of the strains tested [mic90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. against enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), e1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. the mic90s of e1077 for streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; e1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. e1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). the activity of e1077 against p. aeruginosa (mic90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. in vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. e1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. the protective effects of e1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of e1077 caused swelling of s. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in p. aeruginosa. in general, the antibacterial profile of e1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
the in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, rp 59500, rp 57669 and rp 54476, alone and in combination.
rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500 was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
in-vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone antibacterial agent.
the in-vitro activity of tosufloxacin (a-61827) was compared with that of temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and selected members of other groups of antimicrobial agents, against 684 recent distinct clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. against members of the enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was slightly more active than tosufloxacin, which was more active than temafloxacin. the mic90 of tosufloxacin for all species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. was less than or equal to 1 mg/l. tosufloxacin was slightly more active than temafloxacin, and four to eight fold more active than ciprofloxacin, against the gram-positive species tested. the mic90 of tosufloxacin for staphylococcus aureus was 0.12 mg/l, and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.5 mg/l. all strains of neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were inhibited by tosufloxacin at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l. tosufloxacin was the most active quinolone against the anaerobic organisms tested. cross resistance between quinolones was seen, but not between quinolones and other groups of antimicrobials. the protein binding of tosufloxacin across a range of concentrations averaged 60%. human serum at a concentration of 70% decreased the bactericidal activity of tosufloxacin by about four-fold.
in vitro activity and susceptibility to hydrolysis of s-1006.
the in vitro activity of s-1006, the active component of a new orally absorbed cephalosporin, s-1108, inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of group a, b, c, f, and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, and all haemophilus influenzae isolates at less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml. although 50% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms of s-1006 per ml, enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftriaxone were resistant to s-1006. the mics of s-1006 for approximately 20% of providencia, proteus vulgaris, and serratia isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. s-1006 was hydrolyzed by the plasmid tem-3, tem-5, pse-1, and pse-4 beta-lactamases and by the chromosomal beta-lactamase of enterobacter and morganella spp. and p. vulgaris.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
[bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron in pediatrics].
we carried out bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, in pediatrics, and the following results were obtained: 1. when antibacterial activities of panipenem (papm) were determined, it was found that mics against such gram-positive cocci as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae and against such gram-negative rods as escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and branhamella catarrhalis were all sufficiently low. 2. papm showed better mic-correlated antibacterial activities against 215 subcultured strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) than imipenem. 3. clinical efficacies were evaluated to be excellent in 23 of 34 patients treated with papm/bp, excluding 3 patients from the efficacy evaluation. in addition, good responses were obtained in 10 patients but poor response in one, showing the overall efficacy rate of 97.1%. as for bacteriological efficacies, the eradication rate was also determined to be high, 92.6%. 4. as for side effects, rash appeared in 2 patients, and soft stool and diarrhea occurred in one each. the overall incidence of side effects was calculated to be 10.8%. as for abnormal laboratory findings, increases of eosinophiles in 4 patients, thrombocytes in 2, total bilirubin in 1, and got in 1 were observed. from these results, papm/bp was thought to be a highly useful drug in pediatrics.
interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline assessed by microdilution checkerboard techniques.
microdilution methodology was used to study the interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline, a combination therapy that might be used for the treatment of serious pelvic inflammatory disease. the combination of imipenem and erythromycin showed no antagonism for escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae but was antagonistic for staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and group b streptococci; the combination of imipenem and tetracycline was antagonistic for all strains except h. influenzae. correlation between the results of kill curves and the measurement of fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices was good, although fbc indices showed less antagonism than kill curves. fractional inhibitory concentration indices showed poor correlation, rarely showing antagonism, and indeed showed synergy in three cases. if erythromycin or tetracycline is considered necessary in addition to imipenem in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is probably more effective when given after the course of imipenem has been completed.
ampicillin/sulbactam in lower respiratory tract infections: a review.
the pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. the use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. the two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. more than 90% of strains of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella sp, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. in over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. the cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.
evaluation of the microbiology of chronic ethmoid sinusitis.
in a prospective study, patients with the diagnosis of chronic ethmoid sinusitis  were evaluated microbiologically by using biopsy specimens of the ethmoid sinus mucosa. microbiology cultures were performed on 94 specimens from 59 patients. staphylococcus aureus and members of the family enterobacteriaceae were the most frequent classical pathogenic bacteria isolated. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common overall isolates. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were infrequent isolates. no anaerobes, viruses, or chlamydia trachomatis organisms were identified. results of this study showed organism isolation frequencies different from those found in other studies of chronic sinusitis reported in the literature. the predominance of s. aureus and members of the family enterobacteriaceae could have an effect on the antimicrobial therapy for chronic ethmoid sinusitis.
antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
[antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide to fresh clinical isolates].
in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.
the in-vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482), a new oral cephalosporin.
the in-vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482), an orally absorbed aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin, cefaclor and co-amoxiclav. cefdinir was highly active against staphylococcus aureus, inhibiting 90% of strains at 0.03 mg/l. the respiratory pathogens haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis were also susceptible (mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l). the common members of the enterobacteriaceae were susceptible (mic90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l), but those possessing chromosomal beta-lactamases were more resistant. cefdinir appeared highly stable to the tem-1 and shv-1 beta-lactamases with only relatively minor degrees of hydrolysis being seen with tem-3, -5 and -9.
antibacterial activity of rokitamycin compared with that of other macrolides.
the activity of rokitamycin, a 16-membered macrolide, was compared with other macrolides and agents used to treat respiratory infections. rokitamycin had in vitro activity against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae comparable to the other macrolides, inhibiting most organisms at less than 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml. it was the most active macrolide agent against staphylococcus aureus, inhibiting 90% at 1 microgram/ml. macrolide-resistant streptococci and staphylococci in which resistance was inducible were inhibited, but constitutively resistant gram-positive bacteria were resistant. rokitamycin was less active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae, but had activity comparable to erythromycin against moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it inhibited clostridium spp. and peptostreptococci, but had poor activity against bacteroides species. rokitamycin was bactericidal for streptococci and staphylococci, but not for enterococci. overall rokitamycin has in vitro activity comparable to currently available 14-membered macrolides. its clinical utility will be influenced by the degree of metabolism to less active metabolites since 70% is rapidly metabolized.
in-vitro activity of win 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
win 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. the mic90 for staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for s. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. all lancefield group a, b, c, & g streptococci, streptococcus bovis and s. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. for anaerobic bacteria win 57273 had an mic90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. win 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. the mic90 of win 57273 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. win 57273 was more active against gram-negative bacteria at acid ph, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
[clinical evaluation of cefpirome in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
cefpirome (cpr, hr 810), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and its clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. 1. csf concentrations of cpr following intravenous injection was investigated in 2 patients with purulent meningitis. in one of them, the concentrations were 2.11 micrograms/ml and 1.31 micrograms/ml on 3 and 8 days, respectively, after start of administration. in the other patient, they were 24.2 micrograms/ml, and 1.35 micrograms/ml on 2 days and 7 days after administration, respectively. 2. antibacterial activities of cpr against clinical isolates, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, except those against pseudomonas aeruginosa, were clearly superior to those of ceftazidime. 3. clinical efficacies evaluated in 15 patients were "excellent" in 9, "good" in 5 and "unknown" in 1. the overall efficacy rate was 93.0%. 4. clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 1 patient with bacteremia, "excellent" in 6 and "good" in one of 7 patients with pneumonia, and "good" in both of the 2 patients with purulent meningitis. clinical efficacies against other diseases were "excellent" or "good", in 1 patient with pyothorax, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, and 2 patients with facial cellulitis. in 1 patient with biliary tract infection, the results of treatment with cpr were "unknown" due to insufficient clinical data. 5. no adverse reactions were observed except in 1 patient who showed an increase in platelet count.
[bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (cdzm, thr-221), a new cephem  developed by hoechst ag and roussel uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. against gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to those of cefotaxime (ctx), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to that of ctx, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. especially against haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). especially s. pneumoniae in 10 cases, h. influenzae in 12 cases and b. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. as digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. in laboratory test values, elevation of got, elevation of gpt, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. no change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. from above results, we have concluded that cdzm is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
in vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory pathogens derived from cystic fibrosis sputum.
by using broth microdilution methods, the in vitro activity of tosufloxacin (a-64730), a new quinolone, was compared with those of other agents, including five quinolones, against geographically diverse cystic fibrosis sputum isolates obtained from 26 cystic fibrosis centers in the united states. these included pseudomonas aeruginosa, conventional as well as especially resistant (ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin, and/or tobramycin) isolates: escherichia coli; pseudomonas cepacia; staphylococcus aureus; and haemophilus influenzae. tosufloxacin mics for 50 and 90% of isolates of standard p. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 2.0 mg/liter, for resistant p. aeruginosa they were 4.0 and greater than 16.0 mg/liter, for e. coli they were less than or equal to 0.016 mg/liter, for p. cepacia they were 4.0 and 8.0 mg/liter, for s. aureus they were 0.063 and 0.063 mg/liter, and for h. influenzae they were less than or equal to 0.016 and 0.032 mg/liter, respectively. tosufloxacin activities against standard and resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were similar to those of comparative quinolones. against e. coli, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. against s. aureus, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin, but tosufloxacin was more active than other agents. against h. influenzae, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. there was minor diminution of activity at ph 8.2 but major diminution of activity at ph 5.2 and at inoculum sizes of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml. activity was unaffected by sputum but was enhanced by serum and by the omission of cation supplementation. tosufloxacin has consistent activity against common cystic fibrosis pathogens. its high degree of activity against s. aureus with activity maintained against p. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria of interest suggests that further in vitro studies and assessment of activity in in vivo models of cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections are warranted.
in vitro activity of e-1040, a 3-substituted cephalosporin, against pathogens from cystic fibrosis sputum.
on the basis of preliminary in vitro data, we evaluated e-1040, a new cephalosporin, against 188 cystic fibrosis (cf) sputum isolates obtained from 26 cf centers in the united states. these isolates included mucoid and nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and escherichia coli. in addition to mics measured under standard conditions, selected isolates were tested at various ph values, inoculum sizes, and diluent (cf serum and sputum) conditions. e-1040 activities (mics for 50 and 90% of the strains) against the isolates were as follows: p. aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid), 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; p. cepacia, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml; s. aureus, 8 and 8 micrograms/ml; h. influenzae, 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; and e. coli, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. e-1040 activity against mucoid p. aeruginosa was 4-fold greater than that of aztreonam, 16-fold greater than that of ceftazidime, and 32-fold greater than that of piperacillin. e-1040 was similar to other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against s. aureus, h. influenzae, and e. coli. bactericidal activity was less than or equal to 1 dilution of mic for 88% of the strains, although kinetic studies with mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa demonstrated effective killing only at eight times the mic. variations in ph from 5 to 8, in inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml, and in diluent (cf serum or cf sputum) did not affect e-1040 activity.
therapeutic studies of cefepime (bmy 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
cefepime (bmy 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. mice were infected intracranially with streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with s. agalactiae. cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and e. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa meningitis. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. against h. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the least active compound. the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
[clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (azt) were performed in neonates. the results are summarized as follows: a total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. azt 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. concomitantly, vancomycin (vcm) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (abpc) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of azt were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. all of the causative organisms (escherichia coli in 3 and enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with azt. neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by azt was observed. mics of azt against 10 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 1, e. coli 4, klebsiella pneumoniae 1, e. cloacae 1, haemophilus influenzae 1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. as results, azt showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against p. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
postantibiotic effect of the penem fce 22101 against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo by the use of a tissue cage model in rabbits.
isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for their bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect (pae) with the new penem fce 22101. the tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study pae in vivo. the bactericidal activity against all four species was shown to be in the range of 0.05-4.0 mg/l. a 99.9% killing effect at mbc concentrations was reached within 2 hours with s. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae and within 6-8 hours with s. aureus and h. influenzae. after in vitro exposure by fce 22101 a pae in vitro and in vivo was obtained against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae strains but no pae could be demonstrated against k. pneumoniae. fce 22101 showed a good bactericidal activity and pae against the strains investigated, except for k. pneumoniae.
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. in the period from october, 1987 to september, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. the taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (120), haemophilus influenzae (170), mucoid-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), non-mucoid-producing p. aeruginosa (87), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (35), brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. of these strains, 629 were used to determine mics of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. most of the major causative organisms, such as h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but s. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of s. aureus (mcrsa) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. the following is a report of the 1986 findings. during the period from september, 1986 to march, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. of these strains, 75 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 108 of streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of haemophilus influenzae, 107 of pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of p. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of escherichia coli, and 55 of branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to mic determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. in addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. mic determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. from the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. of these strains, 603 could be used for mic determination. an overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, p. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. when the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. the percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. the disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. the next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
cefixime. a review of its antibacterial activity. pharmacokinetic properties and  therapeutic potential.
cefixime, previously designated fk027, fr17027 and cl284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. it is particularly active against many enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. cefixime has little activity against staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. several comparative trials in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor 20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. the most frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. it is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.
in vitro activity of ytr 830.
ytr 830, now known as tazobactam, is a new penicillanic acid sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor. the in vitro activity of ytr 830 combined with various penicillins was determined and compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam combined with the same agents. combined with ampicillin or amoxicillin, all three inhibitors were active against beta-lactamase producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella, citrobacter diversus, and all anaerobes except for bacteroides fragilis homology group ii. ytr 830 was also effective against escherichia coli and indole-positive proteus. the inhibitors had no effect against enterobacter or serratia. overall, the activity of ytr 830 was comparable to that of clavulanate, and superior to that of sulbactam.
antimicrobial activity of ro 23-9424, a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin and desacetylcefotaxime.
ro 23-9424 is a novel ester-linked codrug of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240; am-833) and  the cefotaxime metabolite desacetylcefotaxime. its potency was determined against over 1,000 organisms and found to be intermediate between those of the two components. more than 99% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by greater than or equal micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml; its mic for 50% of strains tested ranged from greater than or equal to 0.06 to 1 micrograms/ml. staphylococci, streptococci, branhamella catarrhalis, corynebacterium jeikeium, bacillus spp., haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and the pathogenic neisseria spp., including oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-producing strains, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, were also inhibited by ro 23-9424. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., and bacteroides fragilis group isolates were more refractory to ro 23-9424 (the mic for 90% of strains tested was less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). overall, ro 23-9424 inhibited 97% of the aerobic strains, compared with 90% for ceftazidime and 92% for cefoperazone. ro 23-9424 was bactericidal, was relatively stable to inoculum effects on mics at 10(7) cfu/ml, and was determined to be highly active against organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. preliminary quality control guidelines were determined, and a 30-micrograms disk concentration appears to be the most usable form.
[antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
in-vitro activity of lomefloxacin (sc-47111) and other quinolones.
the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin and other relevant antibacterial agents. lomefloxacin and norfloxacin shared similar activity, whereas ofloxacin and in particular ciprofloxacin showed superior activity. most gram-negative aerobes were susceptible to all four quinolones, 90% of isolates were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the gram-positive organisms were generally less susceptible, although 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin; values for lomefloxacin and norfloxacin were 1 mg/l and 2 mg/l, respectively; susceptibility was not affected by methicillin resistance. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible to the quinolones, especially ciprofloxacin. penicillin/ampicillin-resistant isolates remained susceptible to the quinolones.

the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) were evaluated in 21 children with a variety of infections. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. pharmacokinetics in 4 children, each receiving a single dose of 60 mg/kg, were evaluated. the average half-life of sbt was 1.03 hours and that of abpc was 0.83 hour. 2. in vitro antimicrobiol activity (mic) of sbt/abpc in which sbt and abpc are combined at a ratio of 1:2 was stronger than abpc alone and was quite effective against staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, but activity against escherichia coli was relatively low. antimicrobial activity of sbt/abpc against s. aureus was almost equal to those of piperacillin (pipc), cefazolin (cez) and cefmetazole (cmz), but against h. influenzae was stronger than those of cez and cmz. activity against e. coli was lower than those of pipc, cez and cmz. 3. a total of 21 patients including 3 with pharyngitis, 10 with bronchitis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 each with acute enteritis, pyelonephritis and suspected sepsis were treated with sbt/abpc. the clinical efficacy rate for these patients was 95.2% (20/21). the bacteriological eradication rate was 80% (8/10). 4. there were 4 instances of side effects, 1 case each of eruption, diarrhea, thrombocytosis and eosinophilia, but all symptoms were transient.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
the usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with sbt/abpc and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. there was no case of failure. 2. bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 staphylococcus aureus, 3 enterococcus faecalis, 4 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 escherichia coli and 1 serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated got and gpt were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. blood levels of sbt and abpc at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. the half-lives of sbt were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of abpc were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro antibacterial activity of sm-7338, a carbapenem antibiotic with stability to dehydropeptidase i.
sm-7338, a new carbapenem antibiotic, was demonstrated to have potent antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of aerobes, including staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp., members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes in a collection of 1,102 unselected clinical isolates. at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml, sm-7338 inhibited 90% of these strains. the spectrum of activity of ceftazidime and cefotaxime was more limited, and many of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were resistant to these agents, piperacillin, or gentamicin. a collection of ofloxacin-resistant strains was inhibited by sm-7338 or imipenem at 4 micrograms/ml. sm-7338 was more active than metronidazole and clindamycin against anaerobes. of the carbapenems, imipenem had greater activity against staphylococci but sm-7338 was much more active against haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria spp. and all genera of enterobacteriaceae tested. the mic of sm-7338 for 90% of these strains ranged from less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.13 micrograms/ml. when tested against 124 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, sm-7338 inhibited 76% at 0.5 microgram/ml but imipenem inhibited only 15% at this concentration. both carbapenems exhibited similar activities against bacteroides spp., but sm-7338 was more active than imipenem against clostridium spp. the mbc of sm-7338 was most commonly the same as or twice the mic. sm-7338 and imipenem showed excellent activities against bacteria elaborating chromosome- or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including those conferring resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins. the activity of sm-7338 was generally unaffected by the culture medium used, ph, 25% human serum, and inoculum size, but the susceptibility of xanthomonas maltophilia was medium dependent.
comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin and other unrelated antimicrobials against bacterial respiratory tract pathogens.
ciprofloxacin is a new fluorinated 4-quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity which includes both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in this study the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin has been determined against bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections and compared with that of other antimicrobial agents used in the therapy of such infections. ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.008 mg/l) was highly active against haemophilus influenzae, including isolates producing beta-lactamase which were resistant to amoxycillin. ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l) was also highly active against branhamella catarrhalis, again including those isolates resistant to amoxycillin as a result of beta-lactamase production. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90 2 mg/l) but were highly susceptible to amoxycillin (mic90 less than 0.12 mg/l) and erythromycin (mic90 0.25 mg/l). isolates of klebsiella aerogenes were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but much less so to amoxycillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, oxytetracycline and erythromycin. ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.5 mg/l) was very active against staphylococcus aureus, including those isolates resistant to amoxycillin and flucloxacillin, and against mycoplasma pneumoniae. together with rifampicin and erythromycin, ciprofloxacin was highly active against legionella pneumophila (mic90 0.015 mg/l). these results suggest that clinical evaluation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections is justified.
[studies on susceptibility of isolated organisms from pediatric infections against various antimicrobial agents].
twelve oral antimicrobial agents were tested for their antimicrobial activities against causative organisms isolated from pediatric infections. activities of these antimicrobial agents against streptococcus pyogenes were also examined in relation to t-antigen typing of the species. the results of the investigation are summarized as follows. 1. against staphylococcus aureus, rokitamycin (rkm), josamycin, ofloxacin, minocycline exhibited strong antimicrobial activities, and few strains of s. aureus showed resistance to these antimicrobial agents. more strains exhibited resistance to erythromycin (em) than to other macrolide antibiotics (mls) examined. amoxicillin (ampc)-resistance was often observed also. 2. against s. pyogenes, beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and rkm had mic80 of 0.20 microgram/ml or below, and no resistant strains of this organism were observed against these antibiotics. only 2 resistant strains (2.0%) of s. pyogenes to mls were detected, but resistance to tetracyclines (tcs) was observed at a high frequency, with 71.4% or more strains among t-4, t-6, t-12 and t-28 antigen types exhibited resistance to tcs. among the 21 strains of t-12 antigen type examined, only one strain (4.8%) was found resistant to mls. these observations suggested that the reduction in the frequency of ml-resistant strains was not due to the reduction in the number of t-12 antigen type strains but due to losses of resistance factors against mls of plasmids. 3. antibacterial activities of beta-lactams and mls against streptococcus pneumoniae strains were good, similarly to activities against s. pyogenes. but many strains of s. pneumoniae were resistant to tcs. 4. new quinolone antimicrobial agents (quinolones) showed excellent activities against branhamella catarrhalis strains with em and rkm showing the next best activities. the number of resistant strains against quinolones, however, seemed to be on an increase. 5. quinolones had strong antimicrobial activities against haemophilus influenzae, few strains of which showed resistance to quinolones. ampc had the next best activity, but approximately 10% of h. influenzae exhibited resistance to this antibiotic. 6. against campylobacter spp., quinolones and mls showed the best activities with mic80 values at or below 0.25 microgram/ml, and no resistant strains of the species against these antimicrobial agents were observed. fosfomycin and tcs showed somewhat inferior activities to quinolones and mls, with beta-lactams showing still lower activities. 7. only few strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia trachomatis were examined, but mls and tcs appeared to be effective against these organisms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
the antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. with regard to ampicillin-resistant enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus ssp. isolates. all beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the tem or oxa enzymes. resistance to both agents was observed in enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. however, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and cefetamet by a class iiia enzyme form proteus vulgaris was marginal. in methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.
in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro23-6240; am 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and a-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was also extremely active against aeromonas hydrophila and haemophilus influenzae isolates with mic90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. the mic90 for three different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. fleroxacin was also active against group jk-diphtheroids and bacillus cereus. the overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of a-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
in vitro studies of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (mic 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. tobramycin was highly active against p. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. the quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. all the quinolones showed high activity against staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. the pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (mic range 4-32 mg/l). all isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). cefuroxime was also highly active against n. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against h. influenzae. the quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates (mic range 1-16 mg/l). the mics of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at ph 8.8 than those obtained at ph 5.8 and 7.3. the activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in ph.
pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies with azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new macrolide with an extended half-life and excellent tissue distribution.
azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new acid-stable 15-membered-ring macrolide, was well  absorbed following oral administration in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. this compound exhibited a uniformly long elimination half-life and was distributed exceptionally well into all tissues. this extravascular penetration of azithromycin was demonstrated by tissue/plasma area-under-the-curve ratios ranging from 13.6 to 137 compared with ratios for erythromycin of 3.1 to 11.6. the significance of these pharmacokinetic advantages of azithromycin over erythromycin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models. azithromycin was orally effective in treating middle ear infections induced in gerbils by transbulla challenges with amoxicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae or susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin failed and cefaclor was only marginally active against the h. influenzae challenge. azithromycin was equivalent to cefaclor and erythromycin against streptococcus pneumoniae. in mouse models, the new macrolide was 10-fold more potent than erythromycin and four other antibiotics against an anaerobic infection produced by fusobacterium necrophorum. similarly, azithromycin was effective against established tissue infections induced by salmonella enteritidis (liver and spleen) and staphylococcus aureus (thigh muscle); erythromycin failed against both infections. the oral and subcutaneous activities of azithromycin, erythromycin, and cefaclor were similar against acute systemic infections produced by streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, or s. aureus, whereas azithromycin was more potent than erythromycin and cefaclor against the intracellular pathogen listeria monocytogenes. the pharmacokinetic advantage of azithromycin over erythromycin in half-life was clearly demonstrated in prophylactic treatment of an acute mouse model of s. aureus infection. these properties of azithromycin strongly support the further evaluation of this new macrolide for use in community-acquired infections of skin or soft tissue and respiratory diseases.
blood cultures in hospitalized children.
the results of 2439 blood cultures that were taken in an acute children's hospital over a two-year period were reviewed. three hundred and twenty-two organisms were cultured from 310 patients. one hundred and thirty-five (5.5%) isolates were considered to be pathogenic and 187 (7.7%) isolates were considered to be contaminants. coagulase-positive staphylococci and enteric gram-negative organisms were the isolates of which the significance was most difficult to determine. community-acquired bacteraemia that affected children of less than five years of age was caused by haemophilus influenzae in 65% of cases. staphylococcus aureus was the major pathogen in older children. in 20% of cases, antimicrobial agents were commenced or changed after blood culture results. delayed or inappropriate therapy was significantly more common in patients without an apparent focus of infection. the results of our study suggest that narrow spectrum antimicrobial agents can be used as appropriate empiric therapy for unlocalized infections in previously-well children. in children of between three months and five years of age, treatment should be directed against haem. influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, and in children of over five years of age, antistaphylococcal therapy should also be included.
[clinical studies on flomoxef in respiratory infection].
clinical efficacy, bacteriological effect and safety of a new antibiotic flomoxef (fmox, 6315-s) in respiratory infections were studied. efficacy of fmox in 6 patients with infectious diseases including 2 cases with pneumonia, 3 cases with acute exacerbation by respiratory infection, 1 case with obstructive pneumonia were clinically evaluated. two strains of haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae and 1 strain of staphylococcus aureus which were detected as causative organisms in 2 cases disappeared or decreased after treatment with fmox. assessing both clinical and bacteriological findings, effects of fmox were good in 5 cases and fair in 1 case. no adverse effects were observed in clinical or laboratory findings. consequently, fmox is considered to be a very useful antibiotic in the treatment for respiratory infectious diseases.
[pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of aspoxicillin in pediatric patients].
since the efficacy and the safety of aspoxicillin (aspc, ta-058) have been established on adult patients and the need of aspc use on pediatric patients was anticipated, we performed a 16 center study on the clinical utility of aspc in pediatric patients. 1. pharmacokinetics aspc was intravenously administered to 45 patients at a dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg by one shot. serum concentrations of aspc were dependent of dose levels, and maximum levels of 58.4-230.8 micrograms/ml and half-lives (beta) of 1.08-1.16 hours were observed. urinary recovery rates were 62.7-67.2% in 6 hours. results obtained upon drip infusions (0.5-1 hour) were similar to one shot injections. 2. clinical results (1) clinical effectiveness of 318 evaluable patients including 175 boys and 143 girls, 18.2% were nurslings and 61% were young children under 4 years of age. one hundred eighty six patients from whom causative organisms were isolated were classified as a group. among them were 5 patients suffered with sepsis, but the aspc treatment eradicated all the bacteria but salmonella java in 1 case. all of 4 patients with meningitis were cured and all causative organisms (3 cases with haemophilus influenzae and 1 case with gram-positive coccus) were eradicated. cure rates were 90% for 130 patients with respiratory tract infection, 88.6% for 35 with urinary tract infection, 85.7% for 7 with skin soft tissue infection and 89.8% for all the a group patients. meanwhile, no causative organisms were isolated from 132 patients (b group patients) but cure rate of 91.7% was obtained for this group. no statistical difference was observed between a and b groups. for all the patients (318), the cure rate was 90.6%. (2) bacteriological effects of 63 gram-positive bacteria isolated as pathogens, 58 strains were eradicated. of 117 gram-negative bacterial, 101 were eradicated. the eradication rate on all 180 strains was 88.3%. overall, aspc showed excellent effects against streptococcus. among strains of staphylococcus aureus, 18 of 20 strains were eradicated. of 59 strains of h. influenzae, 52 were eradicated and 3 decreased. among strains of escherichia coli, 25 of 28 strains were eradicated. of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 strains were decreased and one was unchanged. (3) aspc was effective in 93.3% of 30 patients with serious infections and 79.2% of 72 patients with underlying diseases. cure rates for patients with and without underlying disease were significantly different statistically (chi 2: p less than 0.005).(abstract truncated at 400 words)
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
cs-807 is a new oral prodrug of r-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to r-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. ninety percent or more of pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative proteus spp., providencia rettgeri, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of staphylococcus epidermidis, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. pseudomonas aeruginosa and xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to r-3746. the activity of r-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. r-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of r-3746 at concentrations above the mic. r-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of staphylococcus aureus and 1a, 1bs, and 3 of escherichia coli. systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of cs-807.
[fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections to beta-lactam antibiotics].
in vitro susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens to beta-lactam antibiotics were  determined. bacterial pathogens examined included various isolates from the patients of respiratory tract infections at the hospitals of kyoto-shiga area in 1981 and 1983. major organisms isolated from clinical specimens were haemophilus spp., klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp., s. aureus and streptococcus spp. an increase in the isolation frequency of p. aeruginosa, a decrease in the isolation frequency of h. influenzae and no change in the isolation frequency of the other organisms were observed between the years 1981 and 1983. data from susceptibility tests of clinical isolates confirmed that cefazolin (cez) and cefotiam (ctm) showed good antibacterial activity against s. aureus and cefmenoxime (cmx) was highly effective on streptococcus spp., but that the susceptibilities of both organisms to cez, ctm, and cefmetazole (cmz) in 1983 were lower than in 1981. although cmx also showed good antibacterial activity against klebsiella spp., there were no changes in the effectiveness of ctm, cmz, and cez between the years 1981 and 1983. the in vitro antibacterial activities of cmx and cefoperazone against haemophilus spp. were superior to those of the other beta-lactams tested, but there was a decline in the efficacy for cez. although cefsulodin and piperacillin were highly active against pseudomonas spp., declines in their effectiveness was observed between the years 1981 and 1983.
in vitro evaluation of a-56619 (difloxacin) and a-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
the in vitro antibacterial potencies of a-56619 and a-56620, two new aryl-fluoroquinolones, were compared with the potency of norfloxacin against a broad spectrum of organisms. cefotaxime, aztreonam, piperacillin, imipenem, penicillin, and gentamicin were also tested for reference purposes. the mics required to inhibit at least 90% of the strains tested ranged from 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml for a-56619 and from 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for a-56620 for members of the enterobacteriaceae. a-56619 was generally twofold less potent and a-56620 was twofold more potent than norfloxacin against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including members of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. against indole-positive proteus, morganella, providencia rettgeri, and serratia strains, a-56619 was at least 8- to 16-fold less potent than norfloxacin. a-56619 and a-56620 were four- to eightfold more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and equally potent to fourfold more potent against streptococcus species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mics of a-56619 and a-56620 were only slightly affected by increased inoculum size or by the addition of various cations at physiologic concentrations. a-56619 was three- to fivefold less active at ph 8.0 than at ph 6.5 or 7.2. a-56620 was twofold less active at ph 6.5 than at ph 8.0 or 7.2 against members of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa; similar ph variations did not affect a-56620 activity against gram-positive cocci. the potencies of a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin were less in urine than in mueller-hinton broth; however, this effect was more pronounced with norfloxacin. human serum at a concentration of 50% caused a 4- to 64- fold decrease in the potency of a-56619 and an average 4-fold decrease in the potency of a-56620, compared with no effect on the potency of norfloxacin. a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin were bactericidal and, at four times the mic, reduced the viable cell counts of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa by approximately 99.9% within 2 h. a-56619, a-56620, and norfloxacin showed no significant synergistic activity and no antagonism when they were aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
third-generation cephalosporins: a critical evaluation.
six third-generation cephalosporins--cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, and cefmenoxime--are reviewed; covered are chemistry and structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, spectra of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical utility, adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. the third-generation cephalosporins have a similar mechanism of action to that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. none of the agents is particularly active against certain gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; the drugs are effective against gonococci, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. several common gram-negative pathogens are susceptible to the third-generation cephalosporins, including escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter diversus, proteus, and morganella. about 50% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates are susceptible. only moxalactam has good activity against bacteriodes fragilis. the pharmacokinetic profiles of the six agents reveal some important differences. the half-life of ceftriaxone allows once-daily dosing in many patients; the half-lives of ceftizoxime and cefoperazone permit dosing every 8-12 hours. cefoperazone and ceftriaxone are highly protein bound, but the clinical relevance of this is unknown. generally, the agents penetrate most body tissues and fluids well. moxalactam and cefotaxime and possibly ceftriaxone effectively penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid well. the third-generation cephalosporins have become the accepted drugs of choice for the treatment of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis; as more experience is gained, they are likely to become the drugs of first choice for neonatal (with ampicillin) and childhood (except for moxalactam) meningitis. serious infections of enterobacteriaceae can be treated with these agents, thereby avoiding use of the aminoglycosides. moxalactam is comparable with combination therapy in treating intra-abdominal infections. adverse effects associated with use of the third-generation cephalosporins are generally similar to those that occur with other beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of coagulopathies and the disulfiram reaction seen with moxalactam and cefoperazone. despite the relatively high cost of the third-generation cephalosporins, they are often cost effective because of their reduced dosing frequencies, broad spectra of activity, and effectiveness in serious infections for which more toxic antibiotics have been required in the past.
activity of common antibiotics against branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group a streptococci and staphylococcus aureus in 1983.
the activity of phenoxymethylpenicillin (pcv), ampicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  chloramphenicol, co trimoxazole, doxycycline and erythromycin against clinical isolates of branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, group a streptococci and staphylococcus aureus in 1983 was investigated with the mic-method (plate-dilution technique). forty-six percent of b. catarrhalis, 2% of h. influenzae and 78% of s. aureus were beta-lactamase producing and had high mic-values for penicillin and ampicillin. thus mic for 90% of all strains of b. catarrhalis was 32 mg/l and 8 mg/l for penicillin and ampicillin while mic for 90% of non beta-lactamase producing branhamella strains was 2 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l respectively. this indicates a high susceptibility of penicillins to the action of branhamella beta-lactamase. almost all strains of b. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group a streptococci and s. aureus were inhibited at low concentrations of erythromycin. however, 4 mg/l was required to inhibit 90% of h. influenzae. co-trimoxazole and doxycycline had good activity against all b. catarrhalis and h. influenzae strains while a few pneumococci, streptococci and staphylococci had intermediate sensitivity or were resistant. essentially all strains were sensitive to cefuroxime and chloramphenicol.
ceftriaxone: a summary of in vitro antibacterial qualities including recommendations for susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms disks.
the new aminothiazoyl-cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), was found to have  excellent inhibitory activity against the enterobacteriaceae (minimum inhibitory concentration needed to inhibit 50% of isolates (mic50) less than or equal to 0.004-0.5 microgram/ml, haemophilus influenzae (mic50 less than or equal to 0.004 micrograms/ml), neisseria species (mic50 less than or equal to 0.001 microgram/ml), pneumococci (mic50 0.25 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic50 2.0 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 0.015 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone was less effective against acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species (mic50 8.0-16 micrograms/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were not significantly inhibited by ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone was very resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis, although the type iv cephalosporinase minimally destroyed the compound at 16.4-19.9% of the rates for cephaloridine. type i cephalosporinases were inhibited by ceftriaxone and related enzyme-stable cephalosporins. based on analysis of disk-mic regression statistics, tentative recommendations for the disk test of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards are 21 mm or more = susceptible, 14-20 mm = moderately susceptible, and 13 mm or less = resistant. these criteria produce interpretive accuracy of more than 92%, with very rare major errors. ceftriaxone was comparable to cefotaxime in spectrum and activity, thus allowing the use of the "spectrum-class" concept (for example, cefotaxime tests in vitro to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility, and vice versa).
[susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
during the period from september 1981 to march 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in japan. of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. the data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. in respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. the present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
[evaluation of in vitro antibacterial potencies of oral antibiotics against sputum isolates].
susceptibility of 162 sputum isolates to oral antibiotics was measured by an agar dilution method. the sputum isolates included s. pneumoniae 25 strains, s. aureus 30 strains, h. influenzae 37 strains, k. pneumoniae 51 strains and e. coli 19 strains. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin (cex), ampicillin (abpc) and minocycline (mino) were measured for each strains. eighty percent of s. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.024 to 0.05 micrograms/ml of abpc, 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of ccl, and 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml of cex and mino. abpc, ccl and cex were considered to be effective clinically when they were used with the usual dosage. however, about 30% of strains were resistant to the usual dosage of orally administrated mino. eighty percent of s. aureus strains were inhibited at 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of mino and 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of the other 3 drugs. mino is the most effective with the usual dosage. twenty to 40% of strains showed resistance to ccl, cex and abpc. eighty percent of h. influenzae strains were inhibited at 0.39 micrograms/ml of abpc, 0.78 to 1.56 micrograms/ml of mino, 3.13 micrograms/ml of ccl and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of cex. abpc should be selected as the first choice antibiotic. however, there were 2 abpc-resistant strains that were highly susceptible to ccl. eighty percent of k. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of ccl, 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of mino and cex, and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of abpc. ccl seemed to be only effective oral antibiotic for k. pneumoniae infection.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
antibacterial activity of the cephamycin cefotetan: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the cephamycin, cefotetan, was compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics including the monocyclic beta-lactam, azthreonam, against a total of 277 recent clinical isolates. cefotetan had activity comparable to moxalactam against staphylococcus aureus and against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates except for serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp. at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. cefotetan was active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 mg/l); was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l); and was eightfold less active than cefoxitin against the bacteroides fragilis group. azthreonam was as active as moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae and was more active than moxalactam against ps. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 mg/l, but was inactive against the bact. fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l) and against staphylococcus aureus (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
cefotetan, a new cephamycin: comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activity with other cephems, beta-lactamase stability, and preliminary recommendations for disk diffusion testing.
cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). the in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against 12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those of cefoxitin and cefamandole. no useful activity was present against streptococcus faecalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes types i, iii, and iv beta-lactamases. hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin padac (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin) by type i beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.
antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. in comparison with the other agents, mk 0787 was more or equally active against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., and serratia spp. it inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae. strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to n-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.
cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a new cephalosporin: in vitro activity, comparison with other antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion testing with tentative interpretive criteria.
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365) was evaluated in a multiphased collaborative investigation. over 7,500 consecutive clinical isolates were tested in five laboratories, and greater than 90% of the following organisms were inhibited by cefmenoxime at the following concentrations: enterobacteriaceae and non-enterococcal streptococci, </=0.125 mug/ml; staphylococcus aureus, </=2.0 mug/ml; and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli and bacteroides fragilis group, </=32 mug/ml. both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by cefmenoxime at </=0.03 mug/ml. the spectrum of cefmenoxime was similar to that of other, newer cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime. a pronounced inoculum effect was found with some species upon increasing inocula from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units per ml, resulting in an approximate eightfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations. cefmenoxime was bactericidal when tested with inocula of 10(5) colonyforming units per ml, and mean differences between the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum lethal concentration were less than one log(2) dilution. no significant hydrolysis of cefmenoxime by five different beta-lactamases was detectable, and cefmenoxime exhibited marked inhibition of type i beta-lactamases. regression and error rate-bounded analyses of results of disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on 421 bacterial isolates, and the following tentative zone size breakpoints are proposed: >/=22 mm, susceptible; </=14 mm, resistant; and 15 to 21 mm, moderately susceptible (indeterminate). these data and cross-resistance studies with other newer cephalosporins indicate marked similarity of in vitro activity within this group of drugs, particularly between cefmenoxime, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. any one of these could serve as the representative for the disk diffusion testing of this group of drugs if comparable minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints were used for each drug.
the in-vitro activity of ceftazidime against clinically important pathogens.
a total of 1414 strains of gram-negative bacilli and 250 strains of gram-positive cocci were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the broth dilution method. the strains were clinical isolates from 26 hospitals in the rhein-main area. all the strains were tested against ceftazidime and ten other cephalosporin antibiotics. ceftazidime was found to exhibit an in-vitro activity against enterobacteriaceae similar to that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other new members of the cephalosporin class, but was more active against acinetobacter species. ceftazidime shows extremely high activity both against carbenicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, ampicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae are susceptible to ceftazidime. the activity of ceftazidime against staphylococcus aureus is limited and, like other cephalosporins, it is inactive against streptococcus faecalis.
ceftazidime: comparative in-vitro study.
ceftazidime showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus and a high activity against haemophilus influenzae and the streptococci except against the enterococci. ceftazidime inhibited 90% of the 830 enterobacteriaceae tested at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l and 99% at 8 mg/l, an activity very similar to that of cefotaxime. against pseudomonas spp. ceftazidime proved to be the most active beta-lactam antibiotic studied. it inhibited 67% of the 141 ps. aeruginosa strains at 2 mg/l, 84% at 4 mg/l, 98% at 8 mg/l and 100% at 16 mg/l. the inhibitory and the bactericidal concentrations were very close and there was only a minor effect of the inoculum. ceftazidime retained its high activity against microorganisms with acquired as well as with natural resistance to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.
[fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case, the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.
antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. mk0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. mk0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group a and group b streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. the inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. mk0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against haemophilus influenzae. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of mk0787 against strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., serratia marcescems. pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. the only species found resistant to mk0787 was pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference antibiotics.
susceptibility of 4410 clinical isolates to doxycycline.
in an 1100-bed hospital where doxycycline has been widely used, the susceptibility to doxycycline of 4410 clinical isolates was examined. ninety-one and 80.8 per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae strains, respectively, were susceptible to 1 mg doxycycline/l. seventy-four per cent of the escherichia coli and 81.7 per cent of the klebsiella strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l. the enterobacter and enterococcus strains were less susceptible. nearly all proteus mirabilis isolates were resistant. the results are comparable to those of other studies.
cefaclor compared with amoxycillin acute otitis media with effusion: a preliminary report.
a double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing cefaclor with amoxycillin in  the treatment of acute otitis media with effusion (ome) in infants and children is being conducted at children's hospital of pittsburgh. although the randomization code has not yet been broken, the results of treating the first 55 children are reported, since they appear to be of interest. of the 62 ears with acute ome on which an initial tympanocentesis was performed, 41 positive cultures were isolated from the middle ear aspirates. of the 10 ears from which haemophilus influenzae was isolated, one had a type b strain, and of the remaining unencapsulated strains, one was resistant to both penicillin g and ampicillin. in the one ear from which staphylococcus aureus was isolated, the organism was found to be resistant to ampicillin. however, all of the organisms were sensitive in vitro to cefaclor. in 88% of all subjects observed for the first 2 weeks, the initial symptomatic response was excellent. six children had persistent signs and symptoms of acute ome and received a second tympanocentesis; however, none of the effusions from the repeat aspiration revealed an organism. an effusion was still present in 97% of the ears after 3 days, in 69% after 2 weeks, and in 48% 6 weeks after initiation of the study. tympanocentesis did not appear to affect either the initial clinical response or the persistence of effusion. there were no adverse reactions to either drug in this study. because an apparent increase in the incidence of ampicillin-resistant strains of h. influenzae is being reported, and because of the presence of ampicillin-resistant s. aureus in some ears with acute ome, a new antimicrobial effective against all the common pathogens causing acute middle ear disease would be desirable. in this respect, the preliminary findings of treatment with cefaclor from this study appear promising.
clavulanic acid, a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
clavulanic acid, z-(2r,5r)-3-(beta-hydroxyethylidene)-7-oxo-4-oxa-1-azabicyclo-[3,2,0] heptane-2-carboxylic acid, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of the beta-lactamases of the richmond types ii, iii, iv, and v. inhibition is a time-dependent reaction and is irreversible. clavulanic acid had poor antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory levels greater than 25 mug/ml. it did inhibit the majority of neisseria gonorrhoeae at 0.1 mug/ml and haemophilus influenzae at 6.3 mug/ml. clavulanic acid acted synergistically with penicillins and cephalosporins to inhibit beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus and enterobacteriaceae. clavulanic acid combined with ampicillin inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, and shigella sonnei.
gentamicin and amikacin---an in vitro comparison using 1000 clinical isolates.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of gentamicin and amikacin against 1000 bacterial isolates from clinical material were compared. the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by an agar dilution technique. both of these aminoglycoside antibiotics had a similar spectrum of activity, being highly active against most species of aerobic gram negative bacilli. gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most species of enterobacteria, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus but amikacin was more active against a proportion of klebsiella and providencia isolates. for most isolates, the differences in activity between gentamicin and amikacin were small, however, amikacin achieves higher serum levels. most resistant isolates in this survey did not influence patient mortality.
comparison of bl-s786 with cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin in vitro and in treatment of experimental infections in mice.
the activity of bl-s786 was compared to that of cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin in vitro and in treatment of experimental infections in mice. in broth dilution tests, the activity of bl-s786 was less than cephalothin or cefamandole against staphylococcus aureus and less than cefamandole or cefoxitin against haemophilus influenzae. bl-s786 and cefamandole were the two most active drugs against cephalothin-sensitive enterobacteriaceae. in tests with cephalothin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, bl-s786 was generally less active than cefamandole but more active than cefoxitin against all strains except proteus and providencia. regardless of the comparative in vitro activity of the four drugs, bl-s786 was the most effective drug in treatment of mice lethally infected with enterobacteriaceae. protection from lethality was associated with clearance of bacteremia by each of the four drugs. in several tests where in vitro activity was not predictive of in vivo efficacy, selection of resistance in vivo was found to have occurred.
activity of cefamandole and other cephalosporins against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the activity of cefamandole was comparable to that of cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephaloridine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae. in contrast, cefamandole was considerably more active than cephalothin, cefazolin, or cephaloridine against gram-negative facultative bacilli, including haemophilus influenzae, the most striking disparities being noted with indole-positive proteus and enterobacter. bacteroides fragilis was more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefamandole or cefazolin (median minimal inhibitory concentration, approximately 8, 32, and 32 mug/ml, respectively); cephalothin exhibited still less activity against this species. the majority of other anaerobes were inhibited by relatively low concentrations of all four cephalosporins. the results indicate a potentially valuable role for cefamandole against facultative gram-negative bacilli, including h. influenzae, but no exceptional activity against anaerobes.
[azidocillin: activity in vitro, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic results in whooping cough].
in vitro activities of acidocillin and ampicillin were compared in 20 strains of  haemophilus influenzae, 50 strains of enterococci and 4 strains of bordetella pertussis by serial dilution test. there were no significant differences between both antibiotics. on staphylococcus aureus (100 strains) and streptococcus group a (25 strains) acidocillin was effective at the same degree as phenoxymethylpenicillin. after oral administration of 0.75 g acidocillin (1 h after a standard breakfast) serum peaks in 10 healthy adults were 6.1 +/- 0.51 mug/ml (after 1 1/2 h) which decreased to 0.5 +/- 0.10 mug/ml (after 4 h) and to 0.045 +/- 0.02 mug/ml (after 6 h). urine-recovery in 9 h after oral administration of 0.75 g was found as of 58%, after i.v. administration of the same dose 78% (absorption rate nearly 74%). therapy of whooping cough in 12 children with acidocillin (60 mg/kg/die) led to the disappearance of bordetella pertussis from nasal swabs (only one failure caused by the child's frequent vomiting).
