TI  == halotolerance and survival kinetics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from jalapeno pepper (capsicum annuum l.) fermentation.
AB  == the microbiota associated with spontaneous fermentation of vegetables in a saline substrate may represent an important group of bacteria in the food industry. in this work, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, and leuconostoc citreum were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. in addition, entophytic bacteria such as pantoea eucalypti, pantoea anthophila, enterobacter cowanii, and enterobacter  asburiae were detected, but they were irrelevant for the fermentation process and were inhibited after 12 h of fermentation when the ph decreased from 6.5 to 4.9.  moreover, 2 species of yeast were isolated and identified as hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii and kodamaea ohmeri by their partial 26s rrna gene sequence. the growth of lab was evaluated at different sodium chloride contents. l. citreum was the most halotolerant species followed by l. plantarum and w. cibaria with a  concentration index to obtain a 50% population reduction (ic(50)) of 7.2%, 6.6%,  and 5.2%, respectively. furthermore, the growth of lab and escherichia coli o157:h7 was evaluated in the presence of the main phenylpropanoids from chilli peppers such as p-coumaric and ferulic acid. it was determined that lab can grow  in both acids at 4 mm, unlike e. coli o157:h7, whose growth is inhibited in the presence of these acids.
