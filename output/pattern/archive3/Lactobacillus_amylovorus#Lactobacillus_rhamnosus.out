a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.
anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
purification and characterization of anti-alicyclobacillus bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus.
lactobacillus rhamnosus cicc 20975 produces a 6,502-da bacteriocin, named bacteriocin rc 20975, active against alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, bacillus subtilis, and listeria innocua. this bacteriocin is not quite heat stable but is effective after refrigerated storage and freeze-thaw cycles. bacteriocin rc 20975 was added at a concentration of 256 au/ml to the endospores of a. acidoterrestris dsm 3922; no viable cells were detected after 24 h. the primary mode of action of bacteriocin rc 20975 seems to be the formation of pores, as indicated by k(+) efflux from metabolically active cells of a. acidoterrestris. however, efflux of larger cytoplasmic content was not observed within the first 30 min after bacteriocin rc 20975 treatment. in addition, adsorption of bacteriocin rc 20975 to target cells at different temperatures and ph levels and in the presence of surfactants was studied. finally, the effect that different media, media components, and addition of vitamins to the media had on bacteriocin rc 20975 production was also studied.
[outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
alleviating effects of lactobacillus strains on pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus strains against vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. six-week-old icr mice were pretreated with four lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 (serotype o3:k6). the results showed that v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (fa) and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. in contrast, significant alleviation of fa was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of lactobacillus strains (p < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that received low-dose pretreatments. among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus h15 and lactobacillus brevis y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal fa and villi damage in treated mice (p < 0.05). two low-adhesive strains, lactobacillus acidophilus y14-3 and lactobacillus fermentum f16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. at the same dosing levels, no significant differences in fa were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. our findings suggest that lactobacillus strains can alleviate v. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fa in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.
[assessment of antagonistic activity in vitro lactobacillus spp. strains againts  clostridum difficile strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of patients hospitalized in three hospitals in region mazovia].
introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic activity of  lactobacillus strains against clinical c. difficile strains isolated from faecal samples of adults patients with diarrhea. a total 61 strains of c. difficile randomly selected isolated in the period 2007-2008 from the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients in three hospitals province mazovia, poland. to determination of antagonistic activity ofprobiotic lactobacillus spp. strains used four reference strains: lactobacillus plantarum 2017405, lactobacillus fermentum 353, lactobacillus acidophilus dsm 21007 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. methods: isolation of c. difficile was performed on selective columbia agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxitine and amphothericin b (clo medium, biomerieux, france). the plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37 degrees c. isolates were identified as c. difficile by the characteristic morphology of the colonies and horse-like odour, green yellow fluorescence under uv. toxigenicity of of c. difficile strains was determined in pcr to detection of fragments of genes encoding toxin a (tcda), toxin b (tcdb) and binary toxin (cdta and cdtb). the study of antagonistic activity four lactobacillus spp. strains against 61 clinical c. difficile strains was performed according to standard methods. lactobacillus strains were inoculated on mrs medium and incubated in oxygen-free atmosphere and cut the bars of mrs agar and applied to the plate with cultures of c. difficile strains. results: assessment of antagonist activity of lactobacillus spp. strains was performed by measuring the zone of inhibition of grown of c. difficile strains. the study shows that of probiotic lactobacillus spp. strains interacted antagonistically in vitro against all toxigenic (a+b+cdt- and a+b+cdt+) of c. difficile strains. conclusions: the differences in the antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. strains against different toxigenic clinical c. difficile strains were not observed.
effect of stress pretreatment on survival of probiotic bacteria in gastrointestinal tract simulator.
the effect of stress pretreatment on survival of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, and lactobacillus fermentum me-3 cultures was investigated in the single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator (gits). the cultures were pregrown in ph-auxostat, subjected to temperature, acid, or bile stress treatment, fast frozen in liquid nitrogen (ln(2)), and tested for survival in gits. after ln(2) freezing the colony forming ability of l. rhamnosus gg and l. fermentum me-3 nonstressed and stressed cells was well retained (average survival of 75.4 +/- 18.3% and 88.0 +/- 7.2%, respectively). l. acidophilus la-5 strain showed good survival of auxostat nonstressed cells after fast freezing (94.2 +/- 15.0), however the survival of stress pretreated cells was considerably lower (30.8 +/- 8.5%). all ln(2) frozen auxostat cultures survived well in the acid phase of the git simulation (survival 81 +/- 21%); however, after the bile phase, the colony formation ability of l. acidophilus la-5, l. rhamnosus gg, and l. fermentum me-3 decreased by approximately 1.4 +/- 0.2, 3.8 +/- 0.3, and 3.5 +/- 1.2 logarithmic units, respectively. no statistically relevant positive effect of stress pretreatments on survival of ln(2) frozen l. acidophilus la-5, l. rhamnosus gg, and l. fermentum me-3 in gits was observed.
assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2 cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.
lactobacilli inhibit shigella dysenteriae 1 induced pro-inflammatory response and cytotoxicity in host cells via impediment of shigella-host interactions.
objective: shigella dysenteriae type 1 dysentery is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children from less developed and developing countries. the present study explores the hypothesis that lactobacilli protect the host cell during s. dysenteriae type 1 infection and its mechanism of action. methods: caco-2 cells incubated for 1h with lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactobacillus acidophilus at the multiplicity of infection of 100, either alone or in combination followed by addition of shigella at the same multiplicity of infection for 5h served as treatment groups. cells incubated with shigella without lactobacilli addition served as infected cells. at the end of experimental period, cells were processed suitably to enumerate adherent and internalized shigella. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to assess mrna expression of interleukin-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. immunoblot for heat shock protein-70 and cytotoxicity assay were performed. results: pretreatment with the combination of lactobacilli significantly (p<0.05) prevented adherence and internalization of shigella coupled with reduced expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 in host cells. conclusion: l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, synergistically offered better protection during s. dysenteriae type 1 infection by efficiently inhibiting adherence and internalization of shigella coupled with inhibition of pro-inflammatory response.
probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china.
a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l. rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.
murine immunomodulation of il-10 and il-12 induced by new isolates from avian type 2 lactobacillus acidophilus.
several bacterial and immunogenic factors are involved in the host response to probiotic strains of lactobacillus. here, we report the isolation of new intestinal lactobacilli from chicken, with different immunomodulating properties on lymphoid cells from sjl and c57bl/6 mice. analysis of biochemical markers in the lactobacillus acidophilus cba4p, cba3p, and tpa3p isolates reveal that these bacterial isolates belong to the type 2 prototype, although they differ from each other. the effect of conditioned media (cm) from sjl- and c57bl/6-derived peritoneal macrophages incubated with the 3 sonicated bacterial isolates from chicken, as well as with lactobacillus rhamnosus 9595, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, or staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan were compared. our results show that the cm of macrophages from c57bl/6 and sjl mice treated with the cba4p isolate stimulated syngeneic splenic lymphocytes at a level similar to the one induced with cm from peptidoglycan-stimulated macrophages. in contrast, the cm from tpa3p- and cba3p-treated macrophages promoted low or no stimulation of lymphoid cells. incubation of splenic cells with cm from macrophages treated with l. rhamnosus or tpa3p led to a relative decrease in the percentages of splenic cd4+ t cells, whereas the relative percentages of b cells increased. the cba4p and cba3p isolates induced higher levels of gamma interferon when compared with the tpa3p isolate. the effects of the lactobacilli isolates differed according to the mouse strain used but correlated with the production of macrophagic tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 6, 10, and 12 and with the modulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk). taken together, these results indicate that the immunomodulating properties of the new l. acidophilus isolates depend on their capacity to induce production of interleukins 10 and 12 by macrophages, which is under genetic control and depends on the p38 mapk pathway.
probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.
antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
viability of commercial probiotic cultures (l. acidophilus, bifidobacterium sp.,  l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) in cheddar cheese.
six batches of cheddar cheese were manufactured containing different combinations of commercially available probiotic cultures from three suppliers. duplicate cheeses contained the organisms of each supplier, a bifidobacterium spp. (each supplier), a lactobacillus acidophilus (2 suppliers), and either lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, or lactobacillus rhamnosus. using selective media, the different strains were assessed for viability during cheddar cheese maturation over 32 weeks. the bifidobacterium sp. remained at high numbers with the three strains being present in cheese at 4 x 10(7), 1.4 x 10(8), and 5 x 10(8) cfu/g after 32 weeks. similarly the l. casei (2 x 10(7) cfu/g), l. paracasei (1.6 x 10(7) cfu/g), and l. rhamnosus (9 x 10(8) cfu/g) strains survived well; however, the l. acidophilus strains performed poorly with both decreasing in a similar manner to be present at 3.6 x 10(3) cfu/g and 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/g after 32 weeks. this study indicates that cheddar cheese is a good vehicle for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of l. acidophilus strains will need to be improved.
kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.
in vitro adherence properties of lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20 and bifidobacterium lactis dr10 strains and their antagonistic activity against an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
adhesion and colonisation properties of three probiotic strains namely, lactobacillus rhamnosus dr20, l. acidophilus hn017, and bifidobacterium lactis dr10, were determined in vitro using the differentiated human intestinal cell-lines including ht-29, caco-2, and ht29-mtx, and compared with properties of l. acidophilus la-1 and l. rhamnosus gg (two commercial probiotic strains). two independent methods were employed to quantitate the "adhesiveness" of each strain. in the first method, the bacteria adhered to human cells were detected by gram staining and counted in different fields under a microscope. bacteria were also radio-labelled and extent of adhesion determined by scintillation counting. all three strains showed strong adhesion with the human intestinal cell lines in vitro. adhesion indices of the three strains to two cell lines, i.e. ht-29, and caco-2 varied between 99 +/- 17 and 219 +/- 36. with mucus-secreting cell-line ht29-mtx, the adhesion indices of all the strains were 2-3 times higher. the adhesion indices of l. acidophilus la-1 and l. rhamnosus gg were comparable to the other three probiotic strains. we also investigated the inhibitory effect of adhering strains against the intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a known enterotoxigenic strain of escherichia coli (strain o157:h7). pre-treatment of e. coli o157:h7 with 2.5-fold concentrated cell-free culture supernatants from l. acidophilus hn017, l. rhamnosus dr20 and b. lactis dr10 reduced the culturable e. coli numbers on tsb plates and also reduced the invasiveness and cell association characteristics of this toxic strain. the inhibitory molecules secreted into the spent media by these strains were partially affected by treatments with lactate dehydrogenase, trypsin and proteinase k suggesting that overall inhibition may be due to a synergistic action of lactic acid and proteinaceous substances.
the effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
four common lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. mice received perorally 10(9) viable bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and b-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (lps) (by 27-28%). conversely, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation, particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin a (by 43-68%) and lps (by 23-62%). therefore, these lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on b- and t-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.
the aggregation of human platelets by lactobacillus species.
the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
