TI  - Clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification card.
AB  - A clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification (NHI) card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. Identifications obtained with the NHI card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. The card identified 83.2% of 244 Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 Haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. Some isolates produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications and extra tests were required and suggested. When isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. Among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the NHI card identified 99.1% of 110 N. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 N. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 H. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 H. parainfluenzae strains. All of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for H. influenzae biotypes II, III, and VII, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from H. haemolyticus. The NHI card reliably identified other fastidious gram-negative species, including H. aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Kingella denitrificans.
