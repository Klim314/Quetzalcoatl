protease-sensitive inhibitory activity of cell-free supernatant of lactobacillus  crispatus 156 synergizes with ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and streptomycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa: an in vitro study.
ciprofloxacin and streptomycin are frequently prescribed for the treatment of medical conditions originating due to infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, fluoroquinolone administration has been linked to the outgrowth of clostridium difficile pathogen, especially in immunocompromised patients. secondly, frequent administration of antibiotics may lead to development of resistance in the pathogens. thus, there is a need to explore innovative adjunct therapies to lower the therapeutic doses of the antibiotics. herein, we evaluated the synergism, if any, between conventional antibiotics and the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of vaginal lactobacillus crispatus 156 against p. aeruginosa mtcc 741. l. crispatus 156 was isolated from the human vaginal tract, and its cfs had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against various gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including p. aeruginosa. the inhibitory substance present in the cfs completely lost its activity after treatment with proteinases and was resistant to temperatures up to 80 degrees c and ph ranging from 2 to 6. the cumulative production of the inhibitory substance in cfs was studied, and it showed that the secretion of the inhibitory substance was initiated in middle log phase of growth and peaked in late log phase. further, cfs synergized the activities of ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and streptomycin as evaluated in terms of checkerboard titrations. it lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ciprofloxacin by almost 30 times and mic of both moxifloxacin and streptomycin by 8 times. interestingly, pepsin treatment of cfs caused the complete abrogation of its synergistic effect with all the three antibiotics. thus, from the study, it can be concluded that probiotic-based alternative therapeutic regimen can be designed for the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections.
impact of intensive infection control team activities on the acquisition of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated disease.
the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) is an emerging problem  in acute healthcare facilities. to reduce this transmission, we introduced intensive infection control team (ict) activities and investigated the impact of their introduction. this study was conducted at a single teaching hospital from 1 april 2010 to 31 march 2012. during the intervention period, all carbapenem use was monitored by the ict, and doctors using carbapenems inappropriately were individually instructed. information related to patients with newly identified mdros was provided daily to the ict and instructions on the appropriate infection control measures for mdros were given immediately with continuous monitoring. the medical records of newly hospitalized patients were reviewed daily to check previous microbiological results and infection control intervention by the ict was also performed for patients with a previous history of mdros. compared with the pre-intervention period, the antimicrobial usage density of carbapenems decreased significantly (28.5 vs. 17.8 defined daily doses/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) and the frequency of use of sanitary items, especially the use of aprons, increased significantly (710 vs 1854 pieces/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001). the number of cases with hospital-acquired mrsa (0.66 vs. 0.29 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.23 vs. 0.06 cases/1000 inpatient days; p = 0.006) and nosocomial clostridium difficile-associated disease (0.47 vs. 0.11 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) decreased significantly during the intervention period. our study showed that proactive and continuous ict interventions were effective for reduction of mdro transmission.
using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
novel high-molecular-weight, r-type bacteriocins of clostridium difficile.
clostridium difficile causes one of the leading nosocomial infections in developed countries, and therapeutic choices are limited. some strains of c. difficile produce phage tail-like particles upon induction of the sos response. these particles have bactericidal activity against other c. difficile strains and can therefore be classified as bacteriocins, similar to the r-type pyocins of pseudomonas aeruginosa. these r-type bacteriocin particles, which have been purified from different strains, each have a different c. difficile-killing spectrum, with no one bacteriocin killing all c. difficile isolates tested. we have identified the genetic locus of these "diffocins" (open reading frames 1359 to 1376) and have found them to be common among the species. the entire diffocin genetic locus of more than 20 kb was cloned and expressed in bacillus subtilis, and this resulted in production of bactericidal particles. one of the interesting features of these particles is a very large structural protein of ~200 kda, the product of gene 1374. this large protein determines the killing spectrum of the particles and is likely the receptor-binding protein. diffocins may provide an alternate bactericidal agent to prevent or treat infections and to decolonize individuals who are asymptomatic carriers.
relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site at a university hospital from 1980 to 2008.
background: we describe the relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site over 29 years using hospital-wide surveillance data from a large academic hospital. methods: comprehensive hospital-wide surveillance was provided by trained infection preventionists using centers for disease control and prevention definitions. five 5-year blocks and one 4-year block were created for each site: bloodstream infections (bsi), urinary tract infections (uti), respiratory tract infections (rti), and surgical site infections (ssi). the blocks of relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens were compared by chi(2) analysis, and trends for each pathogen were estimated by regression analysis. results: at least 1 pathogen was isolated from 28,208 (83.5%) of 33,797 health care-associated infections (hai). staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus species, and clostridium difficile and other anaerobes significantly increased, whereas escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, and other streptococci significantly decreased in the relative proportion of pathogens during the study period. by infection site, results showed significant increasing trends of s aureus in uti, rti, and ssi; cons in bsi and ssi; candida in ssi; and enterococcus in bsi and uti. conclusion: significant changes in relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site occurred over the 29-year period. these findings have implications for implementation of infection prevention strategies.
beyond the target pathogen: ecological effects of the hospital formulary.
purpose of review: antibiotic therapy has the potential for intended as well as unintended consequences due to ecological effects that extend beyond the target pathogen. this review examines some of the collateral damage and collateral benefit that may occur when using antibiotic therapy. recent findings: antibiotics excreted in the gastrointestinal tract cause alterations of the indigenous flora. such disruptions may increase the risk of colonization and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, including resistant species, with the potential for serious infection for an individual patient as well as possible hospital-wide dissemination resulting in local outbreaks of infection. for example, clostridium difficile infection (cdi), and particularly associated diarrhea and colitis, is a potentially serious and growing problem in hospitals worldwide, and is associated with disruption of gut flora through use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially those with antianaerobic activity. infection control measures and improved antibiotic stewardship are key measures for cdi prevention. another example is the risk of intestinal colonization and overgrowth with resistant bacteria, which is heightened in surgical patients requiring antimicrobial therapy for intraabdominal infections. results from two optimizing intra-abdominal surgery with invanz studies (oasis-i and oasis-ii) suggested emergence of resistant enterobacteriaceae was less likely in these patients treated with ertapenem than in those treated with ceftriaxone/metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam. finally, recent studies have reported that increased use of a nonpseudomonal carbapenem such as ertapenem does not reduce the susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to pseudomonal carbapenems, for example, imipenem or meropenem. in fact, data from one study showed increased ertapenem/decreased imipenem use was associated with improved susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to imipenem, probably due to decreased selective pressure for resistant species. summary: improper antibiotic use can be associated with detrimental effects related to the ecological impacts of these drugs. improved antibiotic stewardship and appropriate infection control measures are key to minimization of the collateral damage associated with antibiotic therapy and may even have collateral benefits.
human alpha-defensins inhibit hemolysis mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria release exotoxins that belong to the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. here, we report that human alpha-defensins hnp-1 to hnp-3 acted in a concentration-dependent manner to protect human red blood cells from the lytic effects of three of these exotoxins: anthrolysin o (alo), listeriolysin o, and pneumolysin. hd-5 was very effective against listeriolysin o but less effective against the other toxins. human alpha-defensins hnp-4 and hd-6 and human beta-defensin-1, -2, and -3 lacked protective ability. hnp-1 required intact disulfide bonds to prevent toxin-mediated hemolysis. a fully linearized analog, in which all six cysteines were replaced by aminobutyric acid (abu) residues, showed greatly reduced binding and protection. a partially unfolded hnp-1 analog, in which only cysteines 9 and 29 were replaced by abu residues, showed intact alo binding but was 10-fold less potent in preventing hemolysis. surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that hnp-1 to hnp-3 bound all three toxins at multiple sites and also that solution-phase hnp molecules could bind immobilized hnp molecules. defensin concentrations that inhibited hemolysis by alo and listeriolysin did not prevent these toxins from binding either to red blood cells or to cholesterol. others have shown that hnp-1 to hnp-3 inhibit lethal toxin of bacillus anthracis, toxin b of clostridium difficile, diphtheria toxin, and exotoxin a of pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, this is the first time these defensins have been shown to inhibit pore-forming toxins. an "abcde mechanism" that can account for the ability of hnp-1 to hnp-3 to inhibit so many different exotoxins is proposed.
inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
rho gtpases as targets of bacterial protein toxins.
several bacterial toxins target rho gtpases, which constitute molecular switches  in several signaling processes and master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. the biological activities of rho gtpases are blocked by c3-like transferases, which adp-ribosylate rho at asn41, but not rac or cdc42. large clostridial cytotoxins (e. g., clostridium difficile toxin a and b) glucosylate rho gtpases at thr37 (rho) or thr35 (rac/cdc42), thereby inhibiting rho functions by preventing effector coupling. the 'injected' toxins exos, yope and sptp from pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia and salmonella ssp., respectively, which are transferred into the eukaryotic target cells by the type-iii secretion system, inhibit rho functions by acting as rho gap proteins. rho gtpases are activated by the cytotoxic necrotizing factors cnf1 and cnf2 from escherichia coli and by the dermonecrotizing toxin dnt from b. bronchiseptica. these toxins deamidate/transglutaminate gln63 of rho to block the intrinsic and gap-stimulated gtp hydrolysis, thereby constitutively activating the gtpases. rho gtpases are also activated by sope, a type-iii system injected protein from salmonella ssp., that acts as a gef protein.
[in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of bmy 40062, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
the in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, bmy 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. bmy 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. bmy 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. the antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of bmy 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. the in vitro activities of bmy 40062 were influenced by ph and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of bmy 40062 against p. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. in mouse protection tests, the efficacy of bmy 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. bmy 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. compared with ofloxacin, bmy 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. bmy 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated staphylococcus aureus.
