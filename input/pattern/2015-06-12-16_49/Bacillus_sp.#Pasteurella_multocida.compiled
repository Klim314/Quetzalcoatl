TI  - Bacteria associated with enzootic pneumonia in goats.
AB  - A histological and microbiological study of lung samples from 83 slaughtered goats (33 kids and 50 adults) drawn from a flock with a history of pleuropneumonia caused by mycoplasmas of the M. mycoides group was carried out. A total of 82% (27/33) of kids and 36% (18/50) of adult goats presented pulmonary lesions characteristic of enzootic pneumonia: lesions took the form of bronchointerstitial pneumonia with peribronchial and peribronchiolar proliferation of lymphocytes. Microbiological analysis confirmed a range of mycoplasma species, including Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. mycoides Large Colony (MmmlC) (3.70%; 1/27), Mycoplasma mycoides ssp. capri (Mmc) (7.40%; 2/27), Mycoplasma putrefaciens (22.2%; 6/27), Mycoplasma arginini (3.70%; 1/27) and Mycoplasma sp. (7.40%; 2/ 27), as well as Pasteurella multocida (14.8%; 4/27), associated with enzootic pneumonia lesions in younger animals, whereas Mycoplasma sp. was associated with enzootic pneumonia in adult goats (22.0%; 4/18). Cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus found by histochemical examination was associated with enzootic pneumonia in kids (25.9%; 7/27) and goats (44.4%; 8/18), being the first description of this bacterium in adult goats.
TI  - [Main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern Cameroon].
AB  - Between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of Mycoplasma (M.): M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. ovipneumoniae, M. agalactiae, M. sp. type D2 and M. arginini. Eleven Pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes A1, A3, A5, A7 and D2) and 11 Pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. Thirty-two antibiograms were performed on Pasteurella, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Actinomyces pyogenes strains. Eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin G and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. One Capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. Pest of small ruminants (PPR) virus was detected by immunocapture ELISA test performed on some lung samples. Two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats), between 1991 and 1993, and one for PPR (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the North and Far North provinces. No antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. Among the animals in the sample, PPR prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the Far North province and 14 +/- 3% in the North province. Concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated Pasteurella strains. PPR is endemic especially in the Far North province. The efficiency of a vaccination campaign against PPR must be estimated with a field survey.
TI  - Identification of Brucella abortus in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of cows, goats, and mice with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunoenzymatic staining technique.
AB  - An avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex immunoenzymatic staining technique was evaluated for light microscopic detection of Brucella organisms in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Tissues from cows, goats, and mice inoculated with B abortus strain 2308 were examined, using rabbit antiserum to Brucella cell surface protein as primary antibody. Stained organisms were identified histologically in tissue sections containing B abortus, as detected by bacteriologic examination of duplicate nonprocessed tissue samples. Bacillus sp, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, P multocida, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus sp, and Streptococcus sp did not stain with this system, using anti-Brucella cell surface protein primary antibody, thus indicating specificity for Brucella organisms.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  - Oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. The most frequently isolated microorganisms included: IIj, EF-4, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacteria, Neisseria sp., Moraxella sp., and Bacillus sp. Other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. The high incidence of IIj, EF-4, P. multocida, and S. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
