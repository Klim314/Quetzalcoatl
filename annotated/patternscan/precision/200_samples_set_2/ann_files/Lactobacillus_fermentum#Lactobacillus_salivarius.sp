TI  == the use of maldi-tof mass spectrometry, ribotyping and phenotypic tests to identify lactic acid bacteria from fermented cereal foods in abidjan (cote d'ivoire).
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) protein analysis, automated ribotyping, and phenotypic tests (e.g., cell morphology, gas production from glucose, growth and acid production on homofermemtative-heterofermentative differential (hhd) agar medium, sugar fermentation patterns) were used to identify 23 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from fermented cereal foods available in abidjan, cote d'ivoire. pediococcus acidilactici (56.5%), lactobacillus fermentum (30.4%), l. salivarius  (4.3%), p. pentosaceus (4.3%) and l. plantarum subsp. plantarum (4.3%) were the species and subspecies identified. protein based identification was confirmed by  automated ribotyping for selected isolates and was similar to that provided by the phenotypic characterization. maldi-tof ms protein analysis provided a high level of discrimination among the isolates and could be used for the rapid screening of lab starter cultures.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous lactobacillus strains in vitro. the selected lactobacilli include strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. all strains tolerated both ph 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of eps. although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. taken together, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.

TI  == screening of indigenous oxalate degrading lactic acid bacteria from human faeces  and south indian fermented foods: assessment of probiotic potential.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have the potential to degrade intestinal oxalate and this is increasingly being studied as a promising probiotic solution to manage kidney stone disease. in this study, oxalate degrading lab were isolated from human faeces and south indian fermented foods, subsequently assessed for potential probiotic property in vitro and in vivo. based on preliminary characteristics, 251 out of 673 bacterial isolates were identified as lab. a total of 17 strains were found to degrade oxalate significantly between 40.38% and 62.90% and were subjected to acid and bile tolerance test. among them, nine strains exhibited considerable tolerance up to ph 3.0 and at 0.3% bile. these were identified as lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius using 16s rdna sequencing. three strains, lactobacillus fermentum ty5, lactobacillus fermentum ab1, and lactobacillus salivarius ab11, exhibited good adhesion to ht-29 cells and strong antimicrobial activity. they also conferred resistance to  kanamycin, rifampicin, and ampicillin, but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and  erythromycin. the faecal recovery rate of these strains was observed as 15.16% (ty5), 6.71% (ab1), and 9.3% (ab11) which indicates the colonization ability. in  conclusion, three efficient oxalate degrading lab were identified and their safety assessments suggest that they may serve as good probiotic candidates for preventing hyperoxaluria.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in human breast milk: influence of antibiotherapy and other host and clinical factors.
AB  == objective: the objective of this work was to study the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria population in human milk of healthy women, and to investigate the  influence that several factors (including antibioteraphy during pregnancy and lactation, country and date of birth, delivery mode, or infant age) may exert on  such population. methods: a total of 160 women living in germany or austria provided the breast milk samples. initially, 66 samples were randomly selected and cultured on mrs-cys agar plates. then, the presence of dna from the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, and from most of the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species that were isolated, was assessed by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers. results: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be isolated from the milk of 27 (40.91%) and 7 (10.61%), respectively, of the 66 cultured samples. on the contrary, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sequences were detected by pcr in 108 (67.50%) and 41 (25.62%), respectively, of the 160 samples analyzed. the lactobacillus species most frequently isolated and detected was l salivarius (35.00%), followed by l fermentum (25.00%) and l gasseri (21.88%), whereas b breve (13.75%) was the bifidobacterial species most commonly recovered and whose  dna was most regularly found. the number of lactobacilli- or bifidobacteria-positive samples was significantly lower in women who had received antibiotherapy during pregnancy or lactation. conclusions: our results suggest that either the presence of lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria or their dna may constitute good markers of a healthy human milk microbiota that has not been altered by the use of antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of salmonella enteritidis after hatch.
AB  == the protection level against salmonella enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, and control. on d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml of inoculum  in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. two days after hatching, 0.5 ml of salmonella enteritidis culture was  inoculated by the intraesophageal route. on d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain salmonella enteritidis counts. there was no decrease in salmonella enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in  ovo, in relation to salmonella enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.

TI  == behavior of lactobacilli isolated from fermented slurry (ben-saalga) in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == most bacterial strains, which have been studied so far for their probiotic functions, are extensively used by manufacturers in developed countries. in our work, we sought to study a mix (called bsl) comprising three strains belonging to lactobacillus fermentum, l. paraplantarum and l. salivarius, that were isolated from a traditional african pearl millet based fermented slurry. our objective was to study this bsl cocktail in gnotobiotic rats, to evaluate their survival and their behavior in the digestive tract conditions. after a single oral inoculation of germfree rats with bsl, the species established stably in the digestive tract  with the following hierarchy of abundance: l. salivarius> l. plantarum> l. fermentum. bsl cocktail was metabolically active since it produced 50 mm lactate  and it expressed genes involved in binding mechanism in the caecum. furthermore,  the global morphology of the colon epithelium was not disturbed by the bsl cocktail. bsl cocktail did not modify mucus content and host mucus-related genes  (muc1, muc2, muc3 or resistin-like molecule beta). the cocktail of lactobacilli enhanced the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) at a level comparable to what was observed in conventional rats. pcna was involved in proliferation and dna repair, but the presence of the cocktail did not provoke proliferative events (with ki67 as indicator), so we suppose bsl may help gut preservation. this work  is the first step towards the selection of strains that are derived from traditional fermented food to formulate new probiotic mixture.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == bugs that debugs: probiotics.
AB  == the oral cavity harbors a diverse array of bacterial species. there are more than 600 species that colonize in the oral cavity. these include a lot of organisms that are not commonly known to reside in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract and also are more familiar: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus  fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the balance of all these microorganisms can easily be disturbed and a prevalence of pathogenic organisms can lead to various oral health problems including dental caries, periodontitis, and halitosis.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated during traditional fura processing in ghana.
AB  == fura is a millet-based spontaneously fermented dumpling produced and consumed in  parts of west africa, particularly nigeria, burkina faso and ghana. from eight traditional fura production sites in northern ghana, 862 lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified to species level using a combination of genotypic and phenotypic methods including (gtg)(5)-based pcr fingerprinting and 16s rrna gene sequencing, multiplex pcr by means of reca gene sequence comparison, conventional morphological characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation profiling. during millet dough fermentation, ph decreased from 5.6-6.4 to 4.1-3.7 and total lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts increased from 4.4-5.3 to 7.9-9.2 log(10) (cfu/g). the initial stages of the fermentation were characterized by co-dominance of homo- and heterofermentative species of pediococcus acidilactici, weisella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus paraplantarum whereas l. fermentum was dominating at the end of the fermentation. l. fermentum was predominant in all fermentations (p < 0.05) and a high uniformity was observed among production sites regarding the dominance of l. fermentum. l. fermentum and w. confusa were isolated in all production sites and almost at all fermentation stages indicating that they are indigenous to traditional fura processing. the other lab bacteria species which comprised a minor proportion of the total lab occurred occasionally and in an irregular pattern among the production sites.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  == this work was to assess the isolation and identification of thai oral bacteria. seventeen viridans group streptococci (vgs) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16s rna gene sequences analysis. the gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (group  i) were identified as streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (group ii) were streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (group iii) were streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (group iv) was streptococcus mutans. seventeen lactic acid bacterial  isolates were gram-positive and catalase negative. they did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. they were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in group a (11 isolates) and group b (2 isolates) which were identified as lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. the tetrad-forming cocci in group c (3 isolates) and group d (1 isolate) were identified as pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, respectively.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == genotypic characterization and safety assessment of lactic acid bacteria from indigenous african fermented food products.
AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == oral and faecal lactobacilli and their expression of mannose-specific adhesins in individuals with and without iga deficiency.
AB  == lactobacilli are present in the intestine and oral cavity of most adults. secretory iga in mucosal secretions may provide carbohydrate receptors for bacterial adhesins. here, oral and faecal samples from 33 iga-deficient individuals and 34 controls were cultured for lactobacilli, which were identified using species-specific pcr or partial 16s rdna sequencing and tested for expression of mannose-specific adhesins. lactobacilli were found in the oral cavity of 76% of iga-deficient and 85% of control individuals. lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus gasseri dominated in both groups. lactobacillus fermentum was less common in iga-deficient individuals than in controls (p=0.0055) and lactobacillus salivarius was less common in symptomatic than in healthy iga-deficient individuals (p=0.0051). faecal samples yielded lactobacilli in most individuals. l. paracasei was most frequent, followed by l. gasseri and lactobacillus plantarum. mannose-specific adhesins were expressed more frequently by oral than by faecal isolates (p=0.032) and oral isolates adhered in higher numbers than faecal isolates (46 vs. 14 bacteria/cell, p=0.0038). faecal isolates from iga-deficient individuals more frequently expressed mannose-specific adhesins than faecal isolates from controls (p=0.039). mannose-specific adhesins  may be a colonisation factor in the oral cavity, and the presence of secretory iga may modify adhesin expression. however, secretory iga seems to have little influence on lactobacillus species distribution.

TI  == screening for lactobacilli with probiotic properties in the infant gut microbiota.
AB  == lactobacilli are believed to be beneficial for the human hosts and are currently  being evaluated as potentially probiotic bacteria. in this study, lactobacillus strains were isolated from infant faeces and were examined in vitro for potential probiotic properties. faecal specimens from 63 healthy, full-term infants were collected at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. seventy-four lactobacillus strains were isolated and one or more different phenotypes from each infant (n = 44) were selected for further testing. the bacterial isolates were identified mainly as l. gasseri, l. crispatus, lactobacillus paracasei, l. salivarius, l. fermentum after amplification and sequencing of 16s rrna gene. the strains were examined for acid and bile tolerance, adhesion to caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens. the great majority of  the isolated lactobacilli were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. resistance to vancomycin or bacitracin was detected to 34% of the strains. twenty strains out of forty-four exhibited significant tolerance to bile salts. those strains were subsequently tested for resistance to low ph conditions (ph 2 and 3). interestingly, 85% (17 strains) of the tested lactobacilli remained unaffected at ph 3 after 3 h of incubation, 6 strains were found resistant at ph  2 after 1.5 h and only 2 strains found resistant after 3 h of incubation. two of  the strains were able to adhere to caco-2 cells. in conclusion, two isolates fulfilled the in vitro probiotic criteria and are good candidates for further in  vivo evaluation.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == [removal of microcystin-lr by lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == objective: the performance of lactobacillus salivarius bbe09-18, l. fermentum bbe09-29 and l. casei zhang to remove the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin-lr ( mc-lr) were determined in this study, and the key factors related to the removal  efficiency were investigated to analyze the specific mechanism and provide a novel way to deal with the mc-lr contaminated foods. methods: investigate the microcystin-removing capability of cells in different physiological status, e. g. viable and nonviable cells, and compare their removing effects with different biomass, toxin concentration and glucose supplement. results: among these strains, l. casei zhang removed the microcystin-lr most effectively. after a removal treatment with l. casei zhang for 24 h (10(9)) cfu/ml, ph7, 37 degrees c), the mc-lr concentration deduced from 150 microg/l to 85. 5 microg/l. results  also showed that the viable cells were more effective for mc-lr removal than the  nonviable ones. moreover, the removal performance can be improved significantly when glucose was added, and the maximum removal of 92% was observed for l. casei  zhang ( toxin initial concentration 1800 microg/l,10(10) cfu/ml, ph 7.0, 37 degrees c, 24h) with 5% glucose supplement. conclusion: all of the three lab used in this study can remove mc-lr. it can be confirmed that some factors, such as biomass, toxin concentration and energy supplement of cells play important roles  on the removal efficiency. these results suggest further that the mechanism of mc-lr removal in lab may be related to their metabolic activity.

TI  == treatment of infectious mastitis during lactation: antibiotics versus oral administration of lactobacilli isolated from breast milk.
AB  == background: mastitis is a common infectious disease during lactation, and the main etiological agents are staphylococci, streptococci, and/or corynebacteria. the efficacy of oral administration of lactobacillus fermentum cect5716 or lactobacillus salivarius cect5713, two lactobacilli strains isolated from breast  milk, to treat lactational mastitis was evaluated and was compared with the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. methods: in this study, 352 women with infectious mastitis were randomly assigned to 3 groups. women in groups a (n = 124) and b (n = 127]) ingested daily 9 log(10) colony-forming units (cfu) of l. fermentum cect5716 or l. salivarius cect5713, respectively, for 3 weeks, whereas those in group c (n =101) received the antibiotic therapy prescribed in their respective primary care centers. results. on day 0, the mean bacterial counts in milk samples of the 3 groups were similar (4.35-4.47 log(10) cfu/ml), and lactobacilli could not be detected. on day 21, the mean bacterial counts in the probiotic groups (2.61 and 2.33 log(10) cfu/ml) were lower than that of the control group (3.28 log(10) cfu/ml). l. fermentum cect5716 and l. salivarius cect5713 were isolated from the milk samples of women in the probiotic groups a and b, respectively. women assigned to the probiotic groups improved more and had lower  recurrence of mastitis than those assigned to the antibiotic group. conclusions.  the use of l. fermentum cect5716 or l. salivarius cect5713 appears to be an efficient alternative to the use of commonly prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of infectious mastitis during lactation. clinicaltrials.gov identifier. nct00716183.

AB  == a group of 67 lactobacillus spp. strains containing lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius species isolated  from early childhood caries and identified to the species level in a previous study (svec et al., folia microbiol 54:53-58, 2009) was characterized by automated ribotyping performed by the riboprinter microbial characterization system and by randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd-pcr) with m13 primer to evaluate these techniques for characterization of lactobacilli associated with dental caries. ribotyping revealed 55 riboprints among the analysed group. the automatic identification process performed by the riboprinter system identified 18 strains to the species level, however cluster analysis divided obtained ribotype patterns into individual clusters mostly corresponding  to the species assignment of particular strains. rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed by the individual lactobacillus spp. showed higher variability than the ribotype  patterns and the fingerprint profiles generated by the analysed species were distributed among one to four clusters. in conclusion, ribotyping is shown to be  more convenient for the identification purposes while rapd-pcr fingerprinting results indicate this method is a better tool for typing of lactobacillus spp. strains occurring in dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus species and genotypes associated with dental caries in thai preschool children.
AB  == lactobacilli have been associated with the presence and progression of dental caries. nevertheless, the relation between certain species or genotypes of lactobacillus and caries is unclear and there are no data available for the thai  population. this study aimed to examine the distribution of species and genotypes of oral lactobacillus among children with rather high caries prevalence, and to investigate whether certain species or genotypes were more related to caries activity than others. one hundred and sixty-five children were examined for caries status. saliva samples were collected and the numbers of lactobacilli were counted. a total of 357 lactobacillus isolates from 59 children were identified to species level by 16s ribosomal rna genes polymerase chain reaction (pcr) -restriction fragment length polymorphism and 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.  furthermore, 304 isolates from 56 children were genotyped using arbitrarily primed pcr. significant correlation was found between levels of lactobacilli and  dental caries (p < 0.001). among the 10 identified species of lactobacillus, l. salivarius was more prevalent in children with moderate to high caries prevalence compared with children with low caries prevalence, while l. fermentum was the most predominant species in all study groups. moreover, a genetic heterogeneity of lactobacillus species was found among the children and those with high caries  prevalence tended to be colonized with more than one clonal type. in summary, l.  salivarius may be a putative caries pathogen among preschool thai children.

TI  == in vitro immunomodulatory activity of lactobacillus fermentum cect5716 and lactobacillus salivarius cect5713: two probiotic strains isolated from human breast milk.
AB  == commensal bacteria, including some species of lactobacilli commonly present in human breast milk, appear to colonize the neonatal gut and contribute to protection against infant infections, suggesting that lactobacilli could potentially modulate immunity. in this study, we evaluated the potential of two lactobacillus strains isolated from human milk to modulate the activation and cytokine profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) subsets in vitro. moreover, these effects were compared to the same probiotic species of non-milk origin. lactobacillus salivarius cect5713 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716 at 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) bacteria/ml were co-cultured with pbmc (10(6)/ml) from 8 healthy donors for 24 h. activation status (cd69 and cd25 expressions) of natural killer (nk) cells (cd56+), total t cells (cd3+), cytotoxic t cells (cd8+) and cd4+ t cells was determined by flow cytometry. regulatory t cells (treg) were also quantified by intracellular foxp3 evaluation. regarding innate immunity, nk  cells were activated by addition of both lactobacillus strains, and in particular, the cd8+ nk subset was preferentially induced to highly express cd69  (~90%, p<0.05). with respect to acquired immunity, approximately 9% of cd8+ t cells became activated after co-cultivation with l. fermentum or l salivarius. although cd4+ t cells demonstrated a weaker response, there was a preferential activation of treg cells (cd4+cd25+foxp3+) after exposure to both milk probiotic  bacteria (p<0.05). both strains significantly induced the production of a number  of cytokines and chemokines, including tnfalpha, il-1beta, il-8, mip-1alpha, mip-1beta, and gm-csf, but some strain-specific effects were apparent. this work  demonstrates that l salivarius cect5713 and l. fermentum cect5716 enhanced both natural and acquired immune responses, as evidenced by the activation of nk and t cell subsets and the expansion of treg cells, as well as the induction of a broad array of cytokines.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal secretions.
AB  == background and purpose: twenty lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples of healthy volunteers were characterized according to polyphasic taxonomy. a broad spectrum of activity and protective properties of these vaginal isolates has been reported. methods: phenotypic and genotypic methods such as random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd), species-specific and box polymerase chain reaction (pcr), amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), and 16s rrna sequence analyses were applied for lactobacillus spp. identification. results: on the basis of carbohydrate utilization profiles using api 50 chl kits (fermentation pattern), the strains were divided into 7 groups. rapd- and box-pcr analyses revealed heterogeneity within the established phenotypic groups and discriminated successfully between the vaginal strains. the combination of species-specific pcr, ardra, and 16s rrna sequence analyses allowed the species identification of  7 strains as lactobacillus fermentum, 2 as lactobacillus gasseri, 1 as lactobacillus brevis, and 1 as lactobacillus salivarius. these results were not in agreement with data obtained by classical and molecular methods for some clinical isolates. conclusion: this is the first polyphasic taxonomy study on vaginal lactobacilli from bulgarian women of reproductive age. these data add to  the limited information existing in bulgaria on the true identity of lactobacillus spp. in the vaginal microbiota.

TI  == characterization of endogenous plasmids from lactobacillus salivarius ucc118.
AB  == the genome of lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 comprises a 1.83-mb chromosome, a 242-kb megaplasmid (pmp118), and two smaller plasmids of 20 kb (psf118-20) and 44 kb (psf118-44). annotation and bioinformatic analyses suggest that both of the smaller plasmids replicate by a theta replication mechanism. furthermore, it appears that they are transmissible, although neither possesses a complete set of conjugation genes. plasmid psf118-20 encodes a toxin-antitoxin system composed of pemi and pemk homologs, and this plasmid could be cured when pemi was produced in trans. the minimal replicon of psf118-20 was determined by deletion analysis. shuttle vector derivatives of psf118-20 were generated that included the replication region (pls203) and the replication region plus mobilization genes (pls208). the plasmid pls203 was stably maintained without selection in lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and the psf118-20-cured derivative strain of l. salivarius ucc118 (strain ls201). cloning in pls203 of genes encoding luciferase and green fluorescent protein, and expression from a constitutive l. salivarius promoter, demonstrated the utility of this vector for  the expression of heterologous genes in lactobacillus. this study thus expands the knowledge base and vector repertoire of probiotic lactobacilli.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

AB  == aims: the ability of two different lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus salivarius cect5713 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716), isolated from human breast milk, to modulate the immune response was examined. methods and results: in rodent bone-marrow-derived macrophages (bmdm), the presence of lact. fermentum cect5716 induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, in contrast to the activation of il-10 induced by lact. salivarius cect5713. although both strains reduced the lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced inflammatory response in bmdm, the effect of lact. salivarius cect5713 was more efficient, probably because of the production  of higher amounts of il-10 cytokine. in vivo assays in mice showed similar results; the consumption of lact. fermentum cect5716 enhanced the production of th1 cytokines by spleen cells and increased the iga concentration in faeces. however, the consumption of lact. salivarius cect5713 induced il-10 production by spleen cells. conclusion: therefore, in general, the effect of lact. fermentum cect5716 is immunostimulatory in contrast to the anti-inflammatory effect of lact. salivarius cect5713. significance and impact of the study: the results of this study show that two lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk can exert different and even opposing effects on immune response demonstrating the specificity of each strain.

TI  == distribution of salivary lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == we surveyed the distribution of salivary lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in periodontitis patients and healthy subjects. approximately 700 lactobacilli and 300 bifidobacterial isolates were obtained from 16 young, orally healthy subjects (mean age +/- standard deviation: 21.0+/-2.0 y), 16 periodontitis patients (51.6+/-13.8 y), and 14 well-maintained former periodontitis patients (60.2+/-9.6 y). among eleven lactobacillus species detected in saliva, l. salivarius, l. gasseri, and l. fermentum were prevalent, but no species was specifically associated with periodontal health. in contrast,  of four bifidobacterium species, b. adolescentis was specifically (p<0.05) prevalent in young healthy subjects compared with the other two groups. furthermore, the bifidobacterial count of the well-maintained subjects was the highest (p<0.05) among the groups. these results suggest that bifidobacterial count and species might be associated with periodontal health status and/or age.

TI  == quantitative evaluation of adhesion of lactobacilli isolated from human intestinal tissues to human colonic mucin using surface plasmon resonance (biacore assay).
AB  == aims: to isolate lactobacilli from the mucus layer of the human intestine and evaluate their adhesion abilities using a biacore assay. methods and results: thirty strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the mucus layer of normal human intestinal tissues using conventional plate culture. the strains were identified  using homology comparisons of the 16s rdna sequence to databases as lactobacillus salivarius (26%), lactobacillus fermentum (13%), lactobacillus gasseri (10%), lactobacillus paracasei (7%), lactobacillus casei (3%), lactobacillus mucosae (3%) and lactobacillus plantarum (3%). lactobacillus plantarum la 318 shows the highest adhesion to human colonic mucin (hcm) using the biacore assay at 115.30 +/- 12.37 resonance unit (ru). the adhesion of cell wall surface proteins from strain la 318 was significantly higher to hcm than to bovine serum albumin (bsa;  p < 0.05). conclusions: we isolated 30 strains of lactobacilli. lactobacillus salivarius was the predominant species of lactobacilli isolated in this study. the adhesion of strain la 318 isolated from human transverse colon to its mucin was shown. the adhesion could be mediated by lectin-like components on the bacterial cell surface. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study where lactobacilli were isolated from human intestinal tissues and shown to adhere to hcm.

TI  == diversity of lactobacilli in the oral cavities of young women with dental caries.
AB  == for nearly a century, lactobacilli (lb) in the oral cavity have been generally associated with dental caries. here, we characterized the lb isolated from the saliva of 6 women with active caries using genetic-based taxonomical identification methods. from each subject, 30 isolates growing on rogosa medium and presumed to be lb were analyzed. of the 180 isolates, 176 were further characterized by biotyping, dna melting points, dna chromosomal fingerprinting, genotyping, and phylogenetic cluster assessment. we found a total of 30 unique genotypes of lb in the saliva of caries-active women, with each woman harboring between 2 and 8 distinct genotypes. although lactobacillus vaginalis, l. fermentum, and l. salivarius were found in 4 of 6 of the subjects, results from other studies using comparable methods show an entirely different array of lb associated with caries. these collective observations lead us to surmise that lb  associated with dental caries are likely exogenous and opportunistic colonizers,  arising from food or other reservoirs outside the oral cavity.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == alteration of the canine small-intestinal lactic acid bacterium microbiota by feeding of potential probiotics.
AB  == five potentially probiotic canine fecal lactic acid bacterium (lab) strains, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, lactobacillus salivarius lab9, weissella confusa lab10, lactobacillus rhamnosus lab11, and lactobacillus mucosae lab12, were fed to five permanently fistulated beagles for 7 days. the survival of the strains and their potential effects on the indigenous intestinal lab microbiota were monitored for 17 days. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) demonstrated that the five fed lab strains survived in the upper gastrointestinal tract and modified the dominant preexisting indigenous jejunal lab microbiota of  the dogs. when the lab supplementation was ceased, dgge analysis of jejunal chyme showed that all the fed lab strains were undetectable after 7 days. however, the  diversity of the intestinal indigenous microbiota of the dogs, as characterized from jejunal chyme plated on lactobacillus selective medium without acetic acid,  was reduced and did not return to the original level during the study period. in  all but one dog, an indigenous lactobacillus acidophilus strain emerged as the dominant lab strain. in conclusion, strains lab8 to lab12 have potential as probiotic strains for dogs as they survive in and dominate the jejunal lab microbiota during feeding and have the ability to modify the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from canine faeces.
AB  == aims: lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated and sequenced from the faeces of healthy dogs. five of these strains were selected and further characterized to clarify the potential of these strains as probiotics for canine. methods and results: lab were found in 67% (14/21) of the canine faeces samples when plated on lactobacilli selective media without acetic acid. out of 13 species identified with partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, l. mucosae lab12, l. rhamnosus lab11, l. salivarius lab9 and weissella confusa lab10 were selected as candidate probiotic strains based on their frequency, quantity in faeces, growth density, acid tolerance and antimicrobial activity. the minimal inhibitory concentration values of these isolates were determined for 14 antibiotics. l. salivarius lab9, w. confusa lab10 and l. mucosae lab12 were viable in ph 2 for 4 h (mlbs), indicating tolerance to acidity and thus the potential to survive in gastrointestinal tract of the canine. the lab8-lab12 strains showed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus a1 ncimb86166. conclusions: thirteen different lab species were found from the faecal microbiota of the healthy canines. five acid tolerant and antimicrobially active lab strains with the capacity to grow to high densities both aerobically and anaerobically were chosen to serve as candidate probiotics. significance and impact of the study: the selected lab strains are among the first host-specific lab with antimicrobial activity isolated from canines that could serve as potential probiotics for canine use.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of four lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
AB  == aims: the antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius  cect5713, lactobacillus gasseri cect5714, l. gasseri cect5715 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. methods and results: agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. the antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using  a murine infection model with salmonella choleraesuis. the results revealed that  all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. however, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, l. salivarius cect5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a salmonella strain in the murine infection model. conclusion: the four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly l. salivarius cect5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against s. choleraesuis cect4155 in a mouse infection model. significance and impact of the  study: these results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute  to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

AB  == bspa is a non-covalently anchored cystine-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11. it has previously been used to present antigens derived from infectious organisms on the l. fermentum br11 cell surface. in this study, the capacity of bspa to present a very large polypeptide was tested. a temperature sensitive plasmid was constructed that encodes a 175-kda chimeric protein consisting of a fusion between bspa and an n-terminally truncated derivative of the streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 glucosyltransferase gtfj. this plasmid was introduced into the l. fermentum genome. integrants were able to incorporate  20-40 nmol sucrose derived glucose into glucan per ml culture per optical density unit. the glucosyltransferase activity was external to the cytoplasmic membrane and bound to the cell. unlike native bspa, the bspa-gtfj fusion could not be removed from the cell by 5 m licl wash.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == rapid pcr-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common lactobacillus species.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a method allowing rapid identification of the lactic acid bacteria strains in use in the laboratory (lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826; l. fermentum kld; l. reuteri 100-23; l. salivarius ucc43321; l. paracasei lbtgs1.4; l. casei atcc393), based on pcr amplification of 16s rna coding sequences. first, specific forward oligonucleotides were designed in the variable regions of 16s rna coding sequences of six lactobacillus strains. the reverse oligonucleotide was designed in the region where the sequences were homologous for the six strains. the expected size of the amplification product was +/-1000 bp. the specificity of the method was tested on total chromosomal dna. for five out of the six strains, the amplification of the fragment was strain-specific and the method was directly applicable to colonies. for the strain l. casei atcc393, an additional argument to the classification of this bacteria in the paracasei group could be proposed. validation of the developed method was performed by applying it to six lactobacillus reference strains and to various species of bacteria.

TI  == surface properties of lactobacilli isolated from healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: lactobacilli are considered cariogenic micro-organisms. as oral species of lactobacilli have not been thoroughly described, the aim of this work  was to isolated and identify these organisms from teeth, tongue, saliva and gum of healthy patients and to describe some of their surface properties. subjects: forty-four subjects from tucuman, argentina, with d, d and m, m indices equal to  0. materials and methods: samples were obtained from different areas of the oral  cavity. microorganisms were cultured in lactobacilli selected media (lbs) and identified morphologically and biochemically. hydrophobicity was analysed by partition in organic solvents, acidity by affinity with chloroform and basicity with ethyl acetate (math method), aggregation and coaggregation in presence of (nh4)2so4, and haemagglutination with abo erythrocytes in microplates. results: eighty-five lactobacilli were isolated; 29.4% were homofermenter, 44.7% facultative heterofermenter and 25.9% obligate heterofermenter. predominant species were l. fermentum, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, and l. rhamnosus. most of the strains showed moderate to high hydrophobicity and demonstrated high acid and basic surface charges with almost 40% showing salt aggregation. few strains haemagglutinated. conclusions: a variety of lactobacillus species were isolated from healthy mouths, some of whom showed adhesion-related properties such as high hydrophobicity and charged surfaces. probable mechanisms related to the ecological behaviour of lactobacilli in the oral cavity are discussed.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of salmonella enteritidis (se) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. all samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. the means +/- sd of total lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. in the cloaca, lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. in the vagina, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. in the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of se. there was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. no difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. the present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against se colonization.

TI  == starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  == the refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of lactobacillus fermentum, l. casei, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus,  and bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. after 28 days, the average numbers of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml, whereas those of l. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) cfu/ml. numbers of b. longum and l. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and l. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. the other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (p > 0.05) on the residual sugars. in most cases, l(+)-lactate predominated.

TI  == acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final ph recorded. most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum. streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. plaque ph was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or lactulose bp. these studies in vivo showed both lactulose and lactulose bp to exhibit low acidogenic potential. thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.

TI  == lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecum of growing broiler chickens fed on  practical diets containing whole or dehulled sweet lupin (lupinus angustifolius)  seed meal.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. strains of lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and lact. acidophilus and lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before e. coli), competition (lactobacilli and e. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (e. coli added before lactobacilli). tests were made with [14c]-labelled e. coli. suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of e. coli attachment. some strains  of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic e. coli with k88 fimbriae, but  not with a k88-negative mutants strain. these were excluded from the competitive  exclusion experiments. in the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of e. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid  bacteria.

AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == [sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  == sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1  per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.

TI  == cariogenicity of human plaque lactobacilli in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == thirty-two strains of lactobacilli, comprising eight species and obtained from human dental plaque or other sources, were tested for cariogenic potential in gnotobiotic sprague-dawley rats receiving modified cariogenic diet 2000. seventeen of these strains were moderately to highly cariogenic, and only one, a  strain of lactobacillus lactis, was scored as non-cariogenic. the molar fissures  were the predominant site of caries attack. primary lesions of the smooth surfaces were infrequently seen, although these surfaces were often secondarily involved by the extension of fissure lesions. . the preferential location of caries in the sheltered fissure sites was attributed to their inability to form adherent plaque deposits on the smooth surfaces of the teeth. caries production by a strain of l. salivarius was equally severe on sucrose- or glucose-containing versions of diet 2000, but glucose was less supportive of caries development than sucrose for a strain of l. fermentum. it is concluded that a wide variety of lactobacilli may be cariogenic under favorable environmental conditions.

TI  == characterization of two strains of cariogenic lactobacilli.
AB  == two strains of lactobacilli that initiate dental caries in conventional animals were exained for their physiological and serological characteristics. the strain  designated v cl-25 was identified as lactobacillus fermentum and belonged to serological group f. the strain designated iv cl-37 was a lactobacillus salivarius, but it could not be further identified as either of the known subspecies, nor did it belong to serological group g.

TI  == cariogenicity of human oral lactobacilli in hamsters.
AB  == of 50 strains of lactobacilli isolated from dental plaque of school children, two strains, provisionally identified as lactobacillus salivarius, and one strain, provisionally identified as lactobacillus fermentum, induced significant caries activity in conventional hamsters. sucrose was a required dietary cariogenic substrate and could not be replaced with glucose or starch. in contrast to cariogenic strains of streptococcus mutans the active lactobacilli did not form adherent sucrose-mediated plaques in vitro, did not form intracellular iodophilic polysaccharides and did not form detectable insoluble extracellular polyglucans.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  == light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. the total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. lactobacillus fermentum, l. salivarius, and streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of l. acidophilus and s. bovis. all isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
