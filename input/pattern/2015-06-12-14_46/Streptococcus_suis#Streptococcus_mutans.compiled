TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - The changing faces of Streptococcus antigen I/II polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II (AgI/II) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in Gram-positive bacteria. It mediates attachment of S. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. The AgI/II family polypeptides recognize salivary glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation, tissue invasion and immune modulation. The genes encoding AgI/II family polypeptides are found among Streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. suis. Evidence of functionalities for different regions of the AgI/II proteins has emerged. A sequence motif within the C-terminal portion of Streptococcus gordonii SspB (AgI/II) is bound by Porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. The significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. A new picture emerges of the central V (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench, being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an N-terminal alpha-helix and a C-terminal polyproline helix. This presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other Gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Variant size- and glycoforms of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp-340 with differential bacterial aggregation.
AB  - Glycoprotein gp-340 aggregates bacteria in saliva as part of innate defence at mucosal surfaces. We have detected size- and glycoforms of gp-340 between human saliva samples (n = 7) and lung gp-340 from a proteinosis patient using antibodies and lectins in Western blots and ELISA measurements. Western blots of saliva samples, and of gp-340 purified, from the seven donors using a gp-340 specific antibody distinguished four gp-340 size variants, designated I to IV (n = 2,2,2 and 1). While saliva gp-340 variants I to III had single bands of increasing sizes, variant IV and lung gp-340 had double bands. Purified I to IV proteins all revealed a N-terminal sequence TGGWIP upon Edman degradation. Moreover, purified gp-340 from the seven donors and lung gp-340 shared N-glycans, sialylated Galbeta1-3GalNAc and (poly)lactosamine structures. However, the larger size gp-340 grouping II/III (n = 4) and smaller size grouping I/IV correlated with a secretor, Se(+), and a non secretor, Se(-), dependent glycoform of gp-340, respectively (p = 0.03). The Se(+) glycoforms contained ABH, Le(b), Le(y) and polylactosamine structures, while the Se(-) glycoforms lacked ABH antigens but expressed Le(a), Le(x) and lactosamine structures. By contrast, lung gp-340 completely lacked ABH, Le(a/b), Le(x/y) or sLe(x) structures. Gp-340 and secretor typing of saliva from additional donors (n = 29) showed gp-340 glycoforms I to IV for 6, 16, 4 and 0 donors, respectively, and 3 non-typeable donors, and verified that gp-340 glycoforms I and II/III correlate with Se(-) and Se(+) phenotypes, respectively (p < 0.0001). The glycoforms of saliva and lung gp-340 mediated differential aggregation of Le(b)- (Helicobacter pylori), sialylpolylactosamine- (Streptococcus suis) or sialic acid- (Streptococcus mutans) binding bacteria. In conclusion, variant size- and glycoforms of gp-340 are expressed by different individuals and may modulate the biological properties of gp-340 pertinent to health and disease.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In our continued effort to search for a Streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2. A clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. Analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized within a 2.0-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. By in vitro protein synthesis and Western blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kDa. At the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from Streptococcus pneumoniae (89%), Streptococcus mutans (86%), Lactococcus lactis (80%), Listeria monocytogenes (74%), and Clostridium perfringens (64%). Except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, Southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in strains of other S. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the EcoRI recognition sequence. We confirmed expression of the 38-kDa protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most S. suis infections. Pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kDa protein mounted antibody responses to the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against S. suis infection. Analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by Western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. The functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic S. suis capsular types remains to be determined.
TI  - Fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  - Salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. In this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus suis), and oral Actinomyces. Fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. Group I streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group II streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group III streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. Each species of Streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two of these gp340 interaction groupings. The gp340 interaction modes I to III and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. Many gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (I to III) for S. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. Adherence of S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin Hsa. However, aggregation of cells by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of Hsa and involved SspA and SspB (antigen I/II family) polypeptides. Conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of S. mutans NG8 involved antigen I/II polypeptide. Deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in S. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. These results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. This phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.
TI  - [Evaluation of Prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  - The need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to identify streptococcal group antigens (A, B, C, D, F, and G) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. The Prolex agglutination tests (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), distributed in France by i2a, have been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the National Reference Center for Streptococci. The results obtained with the Prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 21 Streptococcus agalactiae, 33 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group C and 27 group G, and 5 Streptococcus porcinus including 4 group B). Four differences between unexpected agglutinations (A or F) and species identifications have been obtained. These differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantarius, and Streptococcus suis. The anti-D reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. Thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the use of Prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus C-terminal motif, Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (LPXTG). This sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. Using the type strain of Streptococcus suis, NCTC 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. One gene, designated srtA, was linked to gyrA, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. Three genes, designated srtB, srtC, and srtD, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. The remaining gene, designated srtE, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five Srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of Streptococcus gordonii and Staphylococcus aureus, except that SrtA of S. suis had 65% identity with that of S. gordonii. Isogenic mutants deficient for srtA, srtBCD, or srtE were generated by allelic exchanges. The protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with N-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srtA mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srtA cloned from S. suis. Four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. The deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the LPXTG motif in their C-terminal regions. On the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srtA mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtBCD and srtE mutants. These results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srtA is also present in S. suis.
TI  - Iron content of Streptococcus suis and evidence for a dpr homologue.
AB  - The type strain of Streptococcus suis was investigated for features that might help the organism to tolerate the H2O2 that is produced during growth. Enzyme assays, using soluble extracts, revealed that the type strain, which lacks catalase, lacks NADH peroxidase in both the mid-exponential and stationary phases of the growth cycle. Although iron could not be detected colourimetrically in dense cell suspensions, determination of the cellular iron content following growth to early stationary phase in the presence of 55FeCl3 demonstrated that S. suis does contain iron and hence is incapable of iron exclusion. Gene amplification, using oligonucleotide primers based on dpr of Streptococcus mutans, followed by nucleotide sequencing, revealed in S. suis, the presence of a gene that encodes a Dpr homologue. It is concluded that in S. suis, tolerance of H2O2 is due to iron sequestration by Dpr and the consequent effect of this process on the extent of Fenton chemistry.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Surface location of HPr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - HPr is a low-molecular-mass phosphocarrier protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) found in the cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. Treatment of Streptococcus suis cells with a Sorvall Omnimixer, a technique used to extract cell surface components, resulted in the extraction of a major protein with a molecular mass of 9 kDa. Several lines of evidence suggested that this protein was HPr: (i) the S. suis protein showed homology over the first 35 N-terminal amino acid residues with the HPrs of Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans, including the signature sequence for the site of PEP-dependent phosphorylation; (ii) it cross-reacted with the S. salivarius anti-HPr antibody preparation; (iii) it could be phosphorylated by enzyme I at the expense of PEP, and by a membrane-associated kinase at the expense of ATP; and (iv) it possessed phosphocarrier activity when used as a source of HPr in an in vitro PTS assay. The data suggested that a portion of the cellular HPr is associated with the external cell surface in S. suis, a result that was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. The cellular HPr of S. suis consisted of two forms that could be distinguished by the presence or the absence of the N-terminal methionine. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the cell-surface-associated HPr of S. suis lacked the N-terminal methionine residue.
TI  - Intrageneric structure of Streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rRNA sequences.
AB  - The partial 16S rRNA sequences of 24 Streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. A comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. The clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. The pyogenic group was extended to include Streptococcus agalactiae, S. parauberis, S. porcinus, and S. uberis. Four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, and S. oralis. Some species (e.g., S. suis and S. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. Our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
