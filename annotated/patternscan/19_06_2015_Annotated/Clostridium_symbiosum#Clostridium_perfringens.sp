TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == comparative serum bactericidal activity against test anaerobes in volunteers receiving imipenem, clindamycin, latamoxef and metronidazole.
AB  == ten healthy volunteers received on separate days the following regimens: imipenem 500 mg, clindamycin 600 mg, latamoxef 1 g, and metronidazole 500 mg. the antibiotics were given intravenously as an infusion over 15 min. blood samples were obtained before and 30 min, 1 and 6 h after the start of the infusion. serum bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were measured against the following strains of strict anaerobes: two strains of bacteroides fragilis, one strain each of b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. oralis, fusobacterium symbiosum, eubacterium lentum, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus magnus. sera  from patients receiving clindamycin showed the highest inhibitory and bactericidal activities except against b. thetaiotaomicron and f. symbiosum. imipenem had similar inhibitory and bactericidal activity to that shown by latamoxef. metronidazole had a moderate activity against all strains although the activity persisted for 6 h. latamoxef was the most active antibiotic against the  test strain of c. perfringens.
