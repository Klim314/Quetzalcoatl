TI  - Dual Activity of a Viral Lysozyme with High Efficiency for Growth Inhibition of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - ABSTRACT The lysozyme from Erwinia amylovora phage PhiEa1h was investigated for its ability to inhibit growth of bacteria and compared with the lysozyme from Escherichia coli phage T4. The assays to measure lysozyme activity included cell lysis and growth inhibition of bacteria. Bacterial strains with kanamycin resistance were not affected by lysates containing the PhiEa1h-enzyme. The titer of Micrococcus luteus but not of Erwinia amylovora was diminished by cell extracts containing T4 lysozyme. In contrast, PhiEa1h lysozyme preferentially inhibited E. amylovora, exceeding the T4 lysozyme activity at least one million-fold. Spherical cells were formed after application to E. amylovora similar to lyz-gene expression in Escherichia coli. Heating of cell extracts destroyed the murami-dase activity, but retained an antibacterial activity. Other plant-associated bacteria related to Erwinia amylovora also were inhibited for growth when cell extracts with PhiEa1h lysozyme were applied to soak pear slices and potato slices. Ooze formation and soft rot caused by E. amylovora or E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, respectively, were strongly reduced and the PhiEa1h lysozyme was more efficient compared with extracts containing T4 lysozyme.
