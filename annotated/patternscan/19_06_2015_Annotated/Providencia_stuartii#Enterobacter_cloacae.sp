TI  == molecular epidemiology of kpc-2-producing enterobacteriaceae (non-klebsiella pneumoniae) isolated from brazil.
AB  == in brazil, since 2009, there has been an ever increasing widespread of the blakpc-2 gene, mainly in klebsiella pneumoniae. this study aims to assess the molecular epidemiology and genetic background of this gene in enterobacteriaceae  (non-k. pneumoniae) species from 9 brazilian states between 2009 and 2011. three  hundred eighty-seven isolates were analyzed exhibiting nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, in which the blakpc-2 gene was detected in 21.4%. by disk diffusion  and e-test, these isolates exhibited high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline (45.6% nonsusceptible) and polymyxin b (16.5%), the most resistant species being enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae. we found great clonal diversity and a variety of blakpc-2-carrying plasmids, all of them exhibiting a partial tn4401 structure. therefore, this study demonstrates the dissemination of kpc-2 in 9 enterobacteriaceae species, including species that were not previously described  such as pantoea agglomerans and providencia stuartii.

TI  == characterization of multiple ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from the same patient.
AB  == a male patient was admitted to a community hospital in ontario, canada, with an infected sacral ulcer after returning from india, where he was hospitalized. carbapenem-resistant escherichia coli (isolated from blood cultures), enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii (from urine samples), all positive for blandm-1, were recovered. comparative ndm-1 plasmid analysis suggests both lateral plasmid transfer and independent acquisition of the blandm-1 gene in these clinical isolates.

TI  == evaluation of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in an italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  == the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blakpc klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). the aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of cre in one italian hospital over a long period (3 years  surveillance, from may 2011 to april 2014). based on defined mic cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. molecular typing was performed using the rapd technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blakpc gene (73 kp, 4 escherichia coli - ec), 51 strains the blavim gene (44 kp, 3 ec, 2 enterobacter cloacae and 2 klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blandm gene (3 kp, 4 ec and one providencia stuartii), 3 the blaoxa-48 gene (2 kp, 1 ec), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-pcr amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the mics obtained with automated instrument and gradient mics of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement  with the results obtained with the gradient mic. the use of rapd allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blakpc and for blavim kp.

TI  == brood ball-mediated transmission of microbiome members in the dung beetle, onthophagus taurus (coleoptera: scarabaeidae).
AB  == insects feeding on plant sap, blood, and other nutritionally incomplete diets are typically associated with mutualistic bacteria that supplement missing nutrients. herbivorous mammal dung contains more than 86% cellulose and lacks amino acids essential for insect development and reproduction. yet one of the most ecologically necessary and evolutionarily successful groups of beetles, the dung  beetles (scarabaeinae) feeds primarily, or exclusively, on dung. these associations suggest that dung beetles may benefit from mutualistic bacteria that provide nutrients missing from dung. the nesting behaviors of the female parent and the feeding behaviors of the larvae suggest that a microbiome could be vertically transmitted from the parental female to her offspring through the brood ball. using sterile rearing and a combination of molecular and culture-based techniques, we examine transmission of the microbiome in the bull-headed dung beetle, onthophagus taurus. beetles were reared on autoclaved dung and the microbiome was characterized across development. a ~1425 bp region of the 16s rrna identified pseudomonadaceae, enterobacteriaceae, and comamonadaceae as the most common bacterial families across all life stages and populations, including cultured isolates from the 3(rd) instar digestive system.  finer level phylotyping analyses based on lepa and gyrb amplicons of cultured isolates placed the isolates closest to enterobacter cloacae, providencia stuartii, pusillimonas sp., pedobacter heparinus, and lysinibacillus sphaericus.  scanning electron micrographs of brood balls constructed from sterile dung reveals secretions and microbes only in the chamber the female prepares for the egg. the use of autoclaved dung for rearing, the presence of microbes in the brood ball and offspring, and identical 16s rrna sequences in both parent and offspring suggests that the o. taurus female parent transmits specific microbiome members to her offspring through the brood chamber. the transmission of the dung  beetle microbiome highlights the maintenance and likely importance of this newly-characterized bacterial community.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.

TI  == volatiles emitted from eight wound-isolated bacteria differentially attract gravid screwworms (diptera: calliphoridae) to oviposit.
AB  == bovine blood inoculated with bacteria isolated from screwworm [cochliomyia hominivorax (coquerel) (diptera: calliphoridae)]-infested animal wounds was tested as an attractant for oviposition for gravid screwworms. eight species of gram-negative coliform (enterobacteriaceae) bacteria mixed with bovine blood singly or all species combined and incubated for various times produced volatiles that attracted gravid flies in a cage bioassay in varying numbers. in 15-min duration tests, volatiles from five species of bacteria (klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii) attracted more females than volatiles of the three species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter sakazakii, and serratia liquefaciens). in 1-h duration oviposition tests, volatiles from the substrate using the same five species of bacteria attracted more females to oviposit than the other three species. volatiles from 24-h incubation period elicited least attraction and oviposition whereas volatiles from the 48- and 72-h incubation period resulted in significantly more attraction and oviposition. attraction and oviposition decreased significantly when the substrates were incubated for 96 h. volatiles from substrate with all species of bacteria combined attracted a significantly higher percentage of flies to land and oviposit than those from substrates prepared with single species. it is possible that multiple active chemicals present in volatiles of the all-species substrate may act as synergists resulting in greater response than those observed with volatiles from single-species substrate. before oviposition flies took a bloodmeal from the oviposition substrate. it is possible that the oviposition is moderated by two different factors in screwworm-first, by using a chemical cue to land on a potential oviposition site and second, by using a bloodmeal to stimulate oviposition.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == novel ctx-m {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of enterobacteriaceae in changsha, southern china.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  ctx-m and shv extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) genotypes in enterobacteriaceae from hunan province, china. methods: clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in changsha, hunan province, were collected between october 2004 and july 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(ctx-m) and bla(shv) were determined. random amplified polymorphic dna was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. results: the overall rate of esbl-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). the dominant esbls were ctx-m types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris and providencia stuartii. the most common bla(ctx-m) genotypes were bla(ctx-m-14) (47.7%), bla(ctx-m-3) (29.4%) and bla(ctx-m-15) (17.4%). a novel gene derived from bla(ctx-m-15), bla(ctx-m-82) (ala-40-->pro), was identified. conclusions: the dominant esbl genotype in hunan province was bla(ctx-m). the high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(ctx-m-15) has not previously been reported from china. our results identify that an epidemic of bla(ctx-m) in changsha, hunan province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(ctx-m-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-3.) the worldwide dominance of bla(ctx-m-15) could be poised to spread to china, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria. a modified double-disc test (mddt) is incorporated in a gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. the mddt identified accurately esbls in all isolates subsequently confirmed as esbl-producers by the  standard clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) combined disc method. of  1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for esbls by mddt and 95 (7.8%) were  positive by the clsi method. esbls were detected in 48 (7.8%) e. coli, 21 (8%) k. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) enterobacter cloacae isolates. time required for esbl detection by the mddt method was one day. the protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of esbls in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems.  thirty-two species 2,697 strains of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of  moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), escherichia coli (n = 250), citrobacter freundii (n = 153), citrobacter koseri (n = 97), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), serratia marcescens (n = 153), proteus mirabillis (n = 103), proteus vulgaris (n = 77), morganella morganii (n = 141), providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii; n = 154), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), pseudomonas putida (n = 49), burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), acinetobactor iwoffii (n = 30), bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola; n = 124). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == further studies on rpos in enterobacteria: identification of rpos in enterobacter cloacae and kluyvera cryocrescens.
AB  == rpos, the alternative sigma factor sigma(s), is important for bacterial survival  under extreme conditions. many enterobacteria are opportunistic human pathogens and their ability to survive in a changing environment could be an essential step for their virulence. to determine the presence of this gene in enteric bacteria,  an escherichia coli rpos probe was constructed and used to detect the presence of this gene in different species. a gene homologous to rpos was found in citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella planticola, kluyvera cryocrescens, serratia rubidaea, shigella sonnei, and yersinia ruckeri. providencia stuartii and proteus vulgaris were the only tested enterobacteria that did not show any signal with the e. coli rpos probe or that did not lead to  amplification of an rpos fragment using specific primers. the rpos gene from e. cloacae and from k. cryocrescens was cloned and sequenced and a mutant allele was constructed in e. cloacae. survival rates under different harsh conditions were followed in order to determine the effect of rpos inactivation in exponential- and stationary-phase cells of both strains. e. cloacae rpos mutants were more sensitive to extreme ph, high osmolarity, and high temperature than the wild-type.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == from the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of mexican fruit flies, anastrepha ludens (diptera: tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, vibrionaceae, micrococcaceae, deinococcacea, bacillaceae, and the genus listeria. enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with citrobacter, streptococcus, aerococcus, and listeria found less frequently. we found bacillus cereus, enterobacter sakazakii, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. we also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as enterobacter cloacae, e. sakazakii, k. pneumoniae spp., providencia rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus cereus. isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == bactericidal activity of cefodizime on enterobacteriaceae in an in-vitro model simulating plasma pharmacokinetics in humans.
AB  == an in-vitro dialysis model was employed to assess the feasibility of once-daily dosing of cefodizime in the treatment of infections caused by various enterobacteriaceae: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii and enterobacter cloacae. this model simulated the concentrations of cefodizime detected in human blood after an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 1 g or 2 g of the antibiotic. validation of the model was undertaken to confirm its utility. based on the data obtained with  this model, once-daily dosing with 1 g cefodizime (i.v.) should be effective against infections due to the commonest gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. morganii). for infections caused by enterobacteriaceae strains that produce large quantities of class i beta-lactamases, twice-daily (p. stuartii or s. marcescens) or four times daily (e. cloacae) administration of 1 g cefodizime may be required.

TI  == cefquinome (hr 111v). in vitro evaluation of a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for infections in animals.
AB  == cefquinome (formerly hr 111v), an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with cefepime, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime against 681 clinical cultures and a challenge set of bacteria with well-characterized resistance mechanisms. cefquinome minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the enterobacteriaceae ranged from < or = 0.12-2 micrograms/ml with the highest mic (4 micrograms/ml) obtained among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and providencia stuartii strains. a total of 90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by  cefquinome at < or = 8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome activity of particular note for  gram-positive isolates included corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (mic50, 4-8 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 32-fold less susceptible (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) to cefquinome than  oxacillin-susceptible (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strains. cefquinome was very potent against fastidious isolates such as moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml); haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06-1 micrograms/ml), neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06-0.5 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus species (mic90, <  or = 0.03-006 micrograms/ml). when tested against organisms possessing bush group 2 enzymes (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), cefquinome remained active (mic, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) against the majority of strains. this compound should be very active against pathogens generally found in animal infections and possesses a potency and spectrum comparable to the "fourth-generation" cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome) being investigated for human infectious diseases.

AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefetamet, the microbiologically active metabolite of the orally administered prodrug cefetamet pivoxil, was compared with that of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and amoxicillin. cefetamet was highly active against enterobacteriaceae, neisseria spp., vibrio spp., haemophilus influenzae and streptococci other than enterococci. cefetamet inhibited cefaclor-resistant species such as proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri and  serratia marcescens. staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-overproducing strains of enterobacter cloacae were resistant to  cefetamet. the superior activity of cefetamet compared with older oral beta-lactam antibiotics against a large number of gram-negative pathogens correlated with enhanced stability towards beta-lactamases. in accordance with the in vitro findings, cefetamet pivoxil showed good activity in experimental infections in the mouse and rat, suggesting satisfactory bioavailability in these animals after oral administration.

TI  == inducible type i beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == mutants, showing either constitutive (depressed) or non-inducible expression of chromosomally-mediated type i beta-lactamase were obtained from clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, ent. aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the wild-type and mutant strains were compared for susceptibility to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis generally, but  not always, resulted in a marked reduction in susceptibility to the agents tested, including the '3rd generation' cephalosporins. in many cases, the observed resistance would preclude, or severely compromise, the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs. in this context, depressed mutants of enterobacter spp., citro. freundii and ps. aeruginosa could be of primary concern although those of  ser. marcescens, prov. stuartii and morg. morganii often exhibited equally high resistance levels to older beta-lactams. comparison of the susceptibilities of the non-inducible mutants with that of their inducible parents suggested variation in the beta-lactamase inductive potency of different compounds in different organisms. for example, cefoxitin was a powerful inducer in ent. cloacae, citro. freundii and one strain of ps. aeruginosa; similarly cefazolin and cefuroxime were good beta-lactamase inducers in ser. marcescens and morg. morganii. aminothiazolyl-oxime cephalosporins and ureido-penicillins were generally poor inducers. from such comparisons, the contribution of inducible type i beta-lactamase to resistance phenotype could be ascertained.

TI  == [carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == selection of multiple antibiotic resistance by quinolones, beta-lactams, and aminoglycosides with special reference to cross-resistance between unrelated drug classes.
AB  == the ability of three quinolones, two beta-lactams, and one aminoglycoside to select resistant mutants was examined in tests with 30 isolates of commonly encountered nosocomial pathogens. ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, two new quinolone derivatives, were no more likely to select resistant mutants than amikacin, whereas nalidixic acid, an older quinolone derivative, was the most likely of the six drugs examined to select resistant mutants. mutational frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-8) were observed in most instances. in general, the  mutants were 8 to 16 times less susceptible to the drug used for selection. although most quinolone-selected mutants were cross-resistant only to other drugs within this class, certain mutants of klebsiella pneumoniae selected by nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin were also less susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. this unusual pattern of multiple drug resistance was associated with changes in outer membrane proteins of the organism. multiple drug resistance was  also observed in beta-lactam-selected mutants of enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa (beta-lactams), amikacin-selected mutants of providencia stuartii and p. aeruginosa (aminoglycosides), and beta-lactam- or amikacin-selected mutants of serratia marcescens (beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides). these results underscore the need to examine carefully the frequency with which resistance to any new antibiotic develops, as well as the patterns of multiple drug resistance which may occur simultaneously.

AB  == pse-2, a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase which was previously considered pseudomonas specific, was observed in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and enterobacter cloacae. all four isolates transferred pse-2 production, together with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and sulfamethoxazole, into escherichia coli j62-1 and pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21. transfer correlated with acquisition by the transconjugants of a 65-megadalton plasmid, and this element was considered to encode pse-2 expression. the pse-2 enzyme conferred high-level carbenicillin resistance on both j62-1 and pu21 transconjugants, although the pse-2-producing providencia stuartii isolate was susceptible to carbenicillin.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. one gram-positive strain and six gram-negative strains were used. bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. tests showed that against klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. the number of viable cells of staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. on the other hand, providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.

TI  == intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  == several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. the following species: proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -ii. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
