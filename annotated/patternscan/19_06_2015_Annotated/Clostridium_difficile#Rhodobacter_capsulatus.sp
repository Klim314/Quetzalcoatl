TI  == dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa to enoyl-coa in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa, which is dehydrated to enoyl-coa by syn-elimination. this  reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pk 40-50). a mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component a, an activator, and component d, the actual dehydratase. component a, a homodimer with one [4fe-4s]cluster, transfers an electron to component d, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4fe-4s]clusters and fmn, concomitant with hydrolysis of two atp. from component d the electron is further  transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. in the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pk14). after elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of atp. the helix-cluster-helix architecture of component a forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of atp resembling an archer shooting arrows. therefore we designated component a  as 'archerase'. here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans, clostridium symbiosum and fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa  dehydratase from clostridium difficile, and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. a relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases is benzoyl-coa reductase from thauera aromatica. analogous but unrelated archerases  are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. in anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven  electron transfer from nadh to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component a, has been established. the transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical na(+)-gradient. this enzyme is related to the rnf proteins involved in rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.
