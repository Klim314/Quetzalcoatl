TI  - Cloning, characterization, and functional expression of the Klebsiella oxytoca xylodextrin utilization operon (xynTB) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli is being developed as a biocatalyst for bulk chemical production from inexpensive carbohydrates derived from lignocellulose. Potential substrates include the soluble xylodextrins (xyloside, xylooligosaccharide) and xylobiose that are produced by treatments designed to expose cellulose for subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Adjacent genes encoding xylobiose uptake and hydrolysis were cloned from Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 and are functionally expressed in ethanologenic E. coli. The xylosidase encoded by xynB contains the COG3507 domain characteristic of glycosyl hydrolase family 43. The xynT gene encodes a membrane protein containing the MelB domain (COG2211) found in Na(+)/melibiose symporters and related proteins. These two genes form a bicistronic operon that appears to be regulated by xylose (XylR) and by catabolite repression in both K. oxytoca and recombinant E. coli. Homologs of this operon were found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus lactis, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Bacillus subtilis based on sequence comparisons. Based on similarities in protein sequence, the xynTB genes in K. oxytoca appear to have originated from a gram-positive ancestor related to L. lactis. Functional expression of xynB allowed ethanologenic E. coli to metabolize xylodextrins (xylosides) containing up to six xylose residues without the addition of enzyme supplements. 4-O-methylglucuronic acid substitutions at the nonreducing termini of soluble xylodextrins blocked further degradation by the XynB xylosidase. The rate of xylodextrin utilization by recombinant E. coli was increased when a full-length xynT gene was included with xynB, consistent with xynT functioning as a symport. Hydrolysis rates were inversely related to xylodextrin chain length, with xylobiose as the preferred substrate. Xylodextrins were utilized more rapidly by recombinant E. coli than K. oxytoca M5A1 (the source of xynT and xynB). XynB exhibited weak arabinosidase activity, 3% that of xylosidase.
TI  - Expression of the Klebsiella pneumoniae CG21 acetoin reductase gene in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - Acetoin reductase catalyzes the production of 2,3-butanediol from acetoin. The gene encoding the acetoin reductase of Klebsiella pneumoniae CG21 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the enzyme was determined to be 768 bp long. Expression of the K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene in E. coli revealed that the enzyme has a molecular mass of about 31,000 Da based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene was cloned into a clostridial/E. coli shuttle vector, and expression of the gene resulted in detectable levels of acetoin reductase activity in both E. coli and C. acetobutylicum. While acetoin, the natural substrate of acetoin reductase, is a typical product of fermentation by C. acetobutylicum, 2,3-butanediol is not. Analysis of culture supernatants by gas chromatography revealed that introduction of the K. pneumoniae acetoin reductase gene into C. acetobutylicum was not sufficient for 2,3-butanediol production even though the cultures were producing acetoin. 2,3-Butanediol was produced by cultures of C. acetobutylicum containing the gene only when commercial acetoin was added.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the beta-galactosidase gene from Enterobacter cloacae GAO.
AB  - The gene encoding a beta-galactosidase from Enterobacter cloacae GAO was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the insert of a positive clone had an open reading frame of 3084 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 1028 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 116,677 daltons. The amino acid sequence of beta-galactosidase deduced from the nucleotide sequence, especially the sequence around the putative active site and of the fourteen regions, showed significant homology to beta-galactosidases of other microorganisms, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Expression and nucleotide sequence of the Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-galactosidase gene cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A gene library for Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 2951 was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR1, and cosmids containing the beta-galactosidase gene were isolated by direct selection for enzyme activity on X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside) plates after conjugal transfer of the library to a lac deletion derivative of Escherichia coli. Analysis of various pSUP202 subclones of the lac cosmids on X-Gal plates localized the beta-galactosidase gene to a 5.1-kb EcoRI fragment. Expression of the Clostridium beta-galactosidase gene in E. coli was not subject to glucose repression. By using transposon Tn5 mutagenesis, two gene loci, cbgA (locus I) and cbgR (locus II), were identified as necessary for beta-galactosidase expression in E. coli. DNA sequence analysis of the entire 5.1-kb fragment identified open reading frames of 2,691 and 303 bp, corresponding to locus I and locus II, respectively, and in addition a third truncated open reading frame of 825 bp. The predicted gene product of locus I, CbgA (molecular size, 105 kDa), showed extensive amino acid sequence homology with E. coli LacZ, E. coli EbgA, and Klebsiella pneumoniae LacZ and was in agreement with the size of a polypeptide synthesized in maxicells containing the cloned 5.1-kb fragment. The predicted gene product of locus II, CbgR (molecular size, 11 kDa) shares no significant homology with any other sequence in the current DNA and protein sequence data bases, but Tn5 insertions in this gene prevent the synthesis of CbgA. Complementation experiments indicate that the gene product of cbgR is required in cis with cbgA for expression of beta-galactosidase in E. coli.
TI  - Utilization of enzymatically hydrolyzed wood hemicelluloses by microorganisms for production of liquid fuels.
AB  - Hemicellulose-derived sugars were obtained from a variety of pretreated wood substrates such as water-soluble fractions from steam-exploded aspen, solvent-extracted aspen, and commercial xylan. These fractions were enzymatically hydrolyzed by commercial enzyme preparations and by the culture filtrates of eight highly cellulolytic fungi. The sugars released were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Over 30% of the hemicellulose fractions, at a 10% substrate concentration, could be hydrolyzed to monosaccharides. These hemicellulose hydrolysates were used as the substrates for growth of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Comparatively low butanol values were obtained with C. acetobutylicum, although over 50% of the hemicellulose fraction, at a 1% substrate concentration, could be converted to 2,3-butanediol, ethanol, and acetic acid by K. pneumoniae.
