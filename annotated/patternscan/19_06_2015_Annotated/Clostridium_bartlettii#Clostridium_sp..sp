TI  == characterization of romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus clostridium into the genera romboutsia gen.  nov., intestinibacter gen. nov., terrisporobacter gen. nov. and asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  == a gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated cribt, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. the major cellular fatty acids of strain cribt  were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain c12-c19 fatty acids, with c16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. the polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the  specific spray reagents used. the only quinone was mk-6. the predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. the peptidoglycan type of strain cribt was a1sigma lanthionine-direct. the genomic dna g+c content of strain cribt was 28.1 mol%. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, strain cribt was most closely related to a number of species of the genus clostridium, including clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), clostridium mayombei (96.2%), clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and clostridium irregulare (95.5%). all these species show very low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus clostridium. dna-dna hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. on the basis of phenotypic and  genetic studies, a novel genus, romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. the novel isolate cribt (=dsm 25109t=nizo 4048t) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. it  is proposed that c. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is  proposed for c. bartlettii, as intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. glycolicum, as terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), c. mayombei, as terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and c. irregulare, as asaccharospora irregularis  gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. in addition, an emendation of the species peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order eubacteriales is provided.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == clostridium bartlettii sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == seven obligately anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming organisms isolated from human faecal specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. strains of the unidentified bacterium used carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, producing acetic acid, isovaleric acid and phenylacetic acid (paa) as the major products of glucose metabolism, and possessed a g +c content of approximately 29.8 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the 7 strains were genetically highly related to each other (displaying >99.5% sequence similarity) and represent a previously unknown  sub-line within the clostridium cluster xi. the closest described species to the  novel bacterium is clostridium glycolicum, although a 16s rrna sequence divergence of 4% demonstrates that they represent different species. genomic dna-dna pairing studies confirmed the separateness of the unknown species and c.  glycolicum (30.6% similarity between the proposed type strain of the novel species, wal 16138, and c. glycolicum atcc 14880(t)). based on morphologic, phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is therefore proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as c. bartlettii sp. nov. the type strain of c. bartlettii is wal 16138(t) (= atccbaa-827(t)=ccug48940(t)).
