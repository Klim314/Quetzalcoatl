TI  - Comparative genome analysis of Pediococcus damnosus LMG 28219, a strain well-adapted to the beer environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediococcus damnosus LMG 28219 is a lactic acid bacterium dominating  the maturation phase of Flemish acid beer productions. It proved to be capable of growing in beer, thereby resisting this environment, which is unfavorable for microbial growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying its metabolic capabilities and niche adaptations were unknown up to now. In the present study, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis were used to investigate this strain's mechanisms to reside in the beer niche, with special focus on not only stress and hop resistances but also folate biosynthesis and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. RESULTS: The draft genome sequence of P. damnosus LMG 28219 harbored 183 contigs, including an intact prophage region and several coding sequences involved in plasmid replication. The annotation of 2178 coding sequences revealed the presence of many transporters and transcriptional regulators and several genes involved in oxidative stress response, hop resistance, de novo folate biosynthesis, and EPS production. Comparative genome analysis of P. damnosus LMG 28219 with Pediococcus claussenii ATCC BAA-344(T) (beer origin) and Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25745 (plant origin) revealed that various hop resistance genes and genes involved in de novo folate biosynthesis were unique to the strains isolated from beer. This contrasted with the genes related to osmotic stress responses, which were shared between the strains compared. Furthermore, transcriptional regulators were enriched in the genomes of bacteria capable of growth in beer, suggesting that those cause rapid up- or down-regulation of gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Genome sequence analysis of P. damnosus LMG 28219 provided insights into the underlying mechanisms of its adaptation to the beer niche. The results presented will enable analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of P. damnosus LMG 28219, which will result in additional knowledge on its metabolic activities.
TI  - Use of a species-specific multiplex PCR for the identification of pediococci.
AB  - In this study, the 23S rRNA genes of nine different Pediococcus type strains were sequenced. By using a multiple sequence alignment with 23S rDNA sequences of related lactic acid bacteria two primer pairs were constructed, one for the general identification of the genus Pediococcus and one for the identification of the atypical species, P. dextrinicus. Furthermore, a primer set for a rapid multiplex PCR identification of the eight typical Pediococcus species was developed. With this technique, the species P. damnosus, P. parvulus, P. inopinatus, P. cellicola, P. pentosaceus, P. acidilactici, P. claussenii, and P. stilesii could be discriminated simultaneously in a single PCR. Experiments with inoculated grape musts showed that the detection limit was 10 cells ml(-1). The multiplex PCR assay was tested by the usage of 62 Pediococcus strains from different culture collections and 47 strains recently isolated from German wines and musts. In addition, contaminations with P. parvulus and P. damnosus could be detected after purification of DNA from spoilt wine samples. The method demonstrates a rapid and easy to handle tool for the species affiliation of pediococci in beverages and food samples.
