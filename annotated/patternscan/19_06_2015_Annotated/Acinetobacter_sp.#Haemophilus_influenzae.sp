TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in makkah, saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: to estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in makkah. methods: this study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; al-noor specialist hospital, and hera hospital in makkah, kingdom of saudi arabia from october 2005  to march 2006. a total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. results: the  most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were escherichia coli (31.6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), klebsiella sp. (6.2%), haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), proteus sp. (3.3%), and enterobacter sp. (1.9%). results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. conclusion: our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. the implementation of  monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.

TI  == [guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  == patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in intensive care units (icus) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop  in patients already hospitalized in icu especially in those requiring mechanical  ventilation for different reasons. within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in icu, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by legionella and haemophilus. pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. the most recent  canadian and american guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections  suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. in case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. whenever a pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as copd, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. early onset hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and early onset ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible staphylocccus aureus e gram negative enteric rods. these infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. late onset vap and hap in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. the possible presence of mrsa or legionella pneumophila suggests  the use of anti-gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. these quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl+), acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == significance of fever in jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  == objective: to investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. design: retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 september 1993 to 31 august 1996). setting: sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in kingston run by the medical  research council laboratories (jamaica). patients: patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees c (102.4 degrees f). main outcome measures: diagnosis, death. results: there were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three streptococcus  pneumoniae, two haemophilus influenzae type b, two salmonella sp, one escherichia coli, one enterobacter sp, and one acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). all cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. a painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those  with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. there were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with h influenzae septicaemia, and a 3  year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. conclusions: painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. enteric gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.

TI  == comb, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of acinetobacter sp. bd413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  == here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging orfs in acinetobacter sp.  bd413, namely lytb, orfy, orfx, comb, and orfz, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comc. the n-termini of the deduced proteins orfy and comb exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein comb is similar to type iv pilins. lytb is similar  to the escherichia coli lytb, which has been implicated in the stringent response. no homologues of orfx, orfy and orfz could be identified. a mutation in orfy or orfz led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comb resulted in a non-competent phenotype. disruption of lytb did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comb is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfy and orfz mutants were due to polar effects on comb and comc, respectively. analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comb mutant suggested that the competence gene comb is not essential for the biogenesis of type iv pili and expression of the type iv pili-associated property of twitching motility. transcriptional fusions between comb and a promoter-free lacz gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comb during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.

TI  == utility of gram's stain and efficacy of quantitative cultures for posttraumatic pneumonia: a prospective study.
AB  == objective: this prospective trial examined the efficacy of using bronchoalveolar  lavage (bal) for the diagnosis of pneumonia (pn) and the utility of gram's stain  (gs) for dictating empiric therapy. summary background data: posttraumatic nosocomial pn remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. however, its diagnosis is elusive, especially in multiply injured patients. the systemic inflammatory response syndrome of fever, leukocytosis, and a hyperdynamic state is common in trauma patients, especially patients with pulmonary contusion. bronchoscopy with bal with quantitative cultures of the lavage effluent may distinguish between pn and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and gs of the lavage effluent may guide empiric therapy before quantitative culture results. methods: mechanically ventilated trauma patients with a clinical diagnosis of pn  (fever, leukocytosis, purulent sputum, and new or changing infiltrate on chest radiograph) underwent bronchoscopy with bal. effluent was sent for gs and quantitative cultures. the diagnostic threshold for pn was > or =10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, and antibiotics were continued. antibiotics were stopped for < 10(5) cfu/ml and the diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome was made. causative organisms for pn were compared to gs. results: over  a 2-year period, 232 patients underwent 443 bronchoscopies with bal (71% men, 29% women; mean age, 41). the mean injury severity score was 30. sixty percent of the patients had pulmonary contusion, and 59% were cigarette smokers. the overall incidence of pn was 39% and was no different regardless of the number of bals a patient had. the false-negative rate of bal was 7%. gs identified gram-positive organisms in 80% of patients with gram-positive pn and 40% of patients with gram-negative pn. gs identified gram-negative organisms in 52% of patients with gram-positive pn and 77% with gram-negative pn. the duration of the intensive care unit stay relative to the timing of bal was beneficial for guiding empiric therapy. bal in week 1 primarily identified haemophilus influenzae and gram-positive organisms; acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas sp. were more common after week 1. conclusions: bronchoscopy with bal is an effective method to diagnose pn and avoids prolonged, unnecessary antibiotic therapy. empiric therapy should be adjusted to the duration of the intensive care unit stay because the causative bacteria flora changes over time. gs of bal effluent correlates poorly  with quantitative cultures and is not reliable for dictating empiric therapy.

TI  == [study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. part 1. an analysis of causal organisms].
AB  == causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to jikei university hospital from 1975 to 1994. eighty patients (50.6%)  were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. the average mortality rate was 18.4%. the mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. staphylococcus  aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). h. influenzae, acinetobacter sp., streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus (gbs) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). the mortality rate of klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), s. aureus (24.1%), s. pneumoniae (22.2%). h. influenzae and acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. e. coli and gbs were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. h. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia pseudomonas sp., klebsiella sp., and acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. e. coli, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae and gbs were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam in lower respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  == the pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. the use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. the two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. more than 90% of strains of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella sp, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. in over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. the cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ci-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. ci-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against gram-positive aerobic organisms including staphylococcus aureus (mics 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (mics 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (mics 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (mics 2 mg/l). all three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas sp., haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for acinetobacter and  pseudomonas aeruginosa mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ci-934 was more active than enoxacin against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. bacteroides species (including about half of the  fragilis group) were susceptible to ci-934 (mics mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin  had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to ci-934 (mics 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less  susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [in vitro activity of carumonam (ro 17-2301) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of carumonam (ro 17-2301), a new synthetic antibacterial agent of the monobactam group, were evaluated by agar dilution for 399 hospital isolates. ro 17-2301 was inactive against gram positive and anaerobic bacteria. most enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by concentrations  less than 1 microgram/ml, with mode mics approximating 0.03 micrograms/ml except  for providencia (0.016), citrobacter (0.06), serratia (0.06) and enterobacter (0.12). a few strains, most of which were enterobacter or citrobacter, had high mics (greater than 8 micrograms/ml). ro 17-2301 was less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 2 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter (mode mic 8-16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus influenzae sp. were sensitive to ro 17-2301 (mode mic 0.12-0.25), regardless of beta-lactamase production status; mics ranged from 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml for meningococci, and from 0.008 to 0.06 for gonococci except for a few strains that had higher mics (0.25 to 0.5 and even 4 micrograms/ml). in vitro activity of ro 17-2301 on gram negative bacteria proved  similar to that of third-generation cephalosporins; cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae are resistant to ro 17-2301.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.
