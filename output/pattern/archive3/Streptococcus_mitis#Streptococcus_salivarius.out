salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius.
salivaricin 9 (sal9) is a 2560 da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic sa-ff22. the sal9 locus (designated siv) in streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin a4. the entire locus was fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of s. salivarius strain jim8780 and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivk, sensor kinase; sivr, response regulator; siva, sal9 precursor peptide; sivm, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivt, abc transporter involved in the export of sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivfeg, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain jim8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in s. salivarius. sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain jim8780, indicating that sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (s. salivarius, s. pyogenes and s. mitis) for siva indicated that it was present only in s. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested s. salivarius positive. since sal9 was inhibitory to all tested s. pyogenes strains it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of s. salivarius probiotics intended to control s. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide paste.
aim: to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide (ch) paste. materials and methods: the sample was composed of two sealers (fill canal((r)) and sealer 26((r))), one ch cement (hydro c((r))), and a ch paste. the agar diffusion test was performed in petri dishes inoculated with the following microorganisms: streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, candida krusei, and candida tropicalis. the diameters of the zones of microbial growth inhibition were measured after 24 h. the tests were performed in triplicate. data were analyzed statistically by anova and tukey's test at 5% significance level. results: fill canal((r)) exhibited the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against the candida species and differed significantly from the other groups (p < 0.001). when inhibition was observed against s. mitis and s. oralis, the ch paste presented a larger mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than those of the other materials (p < 0.05). regarding the inhibition of s. mutans, a statistically significant difference was observed only between the ch paste and hydro c((r)) (p < 0.05); the paste produced the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against this microorganism. regarding the inhibition of s. salivarius, fill canal((r)) presented smaller mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than sealer 26((r)) and ch paste (p < 0.05). conclusion: all the materials presented zones of microbial growth inhibition against all the test bacteria. fill canal((r)) presented the largest mean zone of inhibition against the candida species. for the streptococcus cultures, none of the sealers presented inhibition superior to that of the ch paste.
levofloxacin versus azithromycin on the oropharyngeal carriage and selection of antibacterial- resistant streptococci in the microflora of healthy adults.
objective: to determine the proportion of subjects with oropharyngeal streptococci resistant to either levofloxacin or azithromycin prior to and during antibacterial exposure, and to follow temporal changes in the proportion of resistant and susceptible isolates through 6 weeks post-exposure. this randomized, open-label, single-center study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: nct00821782). research design and methods: a total of 143 healthy volunteers (levofloxacin, n = 71; azithromycin, n = 72) without antibacterial exposure in the previous 90 days received either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days or azithromycin 500 mg once daily on day 1 and 250 mg once daily on days 2 through 5. oropharyngeal cultures were obtained pre-exposure, at day 5, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-dosing. bacterial strains were identified and the minimum inhibitory concentrations for levofloxacin and azithromycin were determined. results: at study entry 117 streptococci were isolated from 72 subjects randomized to azithromycin and 53 (45.3%) were azithromycin-resistant. none of the 121 streptococci isolated from 71 subjects randomized to.levofloxacin were colonized by a levofloxacin-resistant microorganism prior to dosing. at the end of dosing, the number of subjects with resistant streptococci (s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, or alpha streptococcus species [spp.]) increased in azithromycin-exposed subjects and resistant isolates remained through 6 weeks post-dosing. in contrast, a small number of levofloxacin-resistant streptococci were observed at the end of dosing but decreased by week 2 post-dosing and continued to decrease through the 6-week evaluation period (p < 0.001 azithromycin vs. levofloxacin for s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and alpha streptococcus spp. at week 6). limitations of this study included the fact that, since previous antibiotic use was self-reported, genetic typing was not done. the results of this study may not be completely generalizable, because subjects in this study received study drug under directly-observed conditions, thus ensuring compliance. conclusions: both antibacterial agents were well tolerated. levofloxacin 750 mg administered for 5 days was associated with less microbial resistance than that observed with azithromycin in healthy subjects.
[effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb. further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s. mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.
reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis. all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.
the oral microbiota of children undergoing liver transplantation.
this study investigated the oral microbiota of children undergoing liver transplantation. oral swabs were taken using a standardized procedure from 27 children before liver transplantation and at 3 and 100 days post-transplantation and from 27 healthy controls at baseline and 90 days. viridans streptococci, yeasts, staphylococci, enterococci and enterobacteriaceae were enumerated and identified using conventional techniques. the oral microbiota of the patients changed significantly immediately post-transplantation, but by the final examination, it had returned to baseline levels. the oral microbiota of the controls did not change significantly. the numbers and proportions of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii as percentages of the total streptococcal counts and of the total anaerobic counts decreased significantly 3 days post-transplantation (p < or = 0.006). there were no significant changes in the numbers and proportions of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis isolated pre- and post-transplantation. the isolation frequencies and numbers of yeasts were significantly higher in patients than controls. staphylococci were isolated in low numbers from all children. enterococci and enterobacteriaceae were isolated infrequently from patients.
purification and properties of a bacteriocin of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
an extracellular bacteriocin of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. its molecular mass was 3500 da and pi was 10.5. this bacteriocin inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis, but streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. the mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.
antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.
exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring. two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine. g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.
hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
