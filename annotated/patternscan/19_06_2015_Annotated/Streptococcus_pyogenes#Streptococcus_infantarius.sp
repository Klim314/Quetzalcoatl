TI  == competence for natural genetic transformation in the streptococcus bovis group streptococci s. infantarius and s. macedonicus.
AB  == natural genetic transformation is common among many species of the genus streptococcus, but it has never, or rarely, been reported for the streptococcus pyogenes and s. bovis groups of species, even though many streptococcal competence genes and the competence regulators sigx, comr, and coms are well conserved in both groups. to explore the incidence of competence in the s. bovis  group, 25 isolates of s. infantarius and s. macedonicus were surveyed by employing culture in chemically defined media devoid of peptide nutrients and treatment with synthetic candidate pheromone peptides predicted from the sequence of the gene coms. approximately half of strains examined were transformable, many transforming at high rates comparable to those for the well-characterized streptococcal natural transformation systems. in s. infantarius, nanomolar amounts of the synthetic pheromone ltawwgl induced robust but transient competence in high-density cultures, but mutation of the comrs locus abolished transformation. we conclude that at least these two species of the s. bovis group retain a robust system of natural transformation regulated by a comrs pheromone circuit and the alternative sigma factor sigx and infer that transformation is even more common among the streptococci than has been recognized. the tools presented here will facilitate targeted genetic manipulation in this group of streptococci.

TI  == [evaluation of prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  == the need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to  identify streptococcal group antigens (a, b, c, d, f, and g) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. the prolex agglutination tests (pro-lab diagnostics, richmond hill, ontario, canada), distributed in france by i2a, have  been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the national reference center for streptococci. the results obtained with the prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 streptococcus pyogenes, 21 streptococcus agalactiae, 33 streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group c and 27 group g, and 5 streptococcus porcinus including 4 group b). four differences between unexpected agglutinations (a or f) and species identifications have been obtained. these differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii,  streptococcus infantarius, and streptococcus suis. the anti-d reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, the use of prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
