TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == analysis of the bacterial diversity existing on animal hide and wool: development of a preliminary pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint database for identifying isolates.
AB  == twenty-one bacterial strains were isolated from imported cattle hide and rabbit wool using two types of media, nutrient broth, and nutrient broth with serum. the bacteria identified were brevibacillus laterosporus, leclercia adecarboxylata, peptococcus niger, bacillus circulans, raoultella ornithinolytica, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, bacillus thermobacillus, bacillus choshinensis, bacillus sphaericus, acinetobacter haemolyticus, sphingomonas paucimobilis, bacillus thuringiensis, staphylococcus intermedius, mycobacteria, moraxella, klebsiella pneumoniae, ralstonia pickettii, staphylococcus chromogenes, comamonas testosteroni, and cupriavidus pauculus. the 16s rdna gene of each bacterium was amplified using the universal primers 27f and 1492r. the amplicons were digested  with avai, bamhi, bgii, drai, ecori, ecorv, hindiii, hinfi, hpai, psti, smai, taqii, xbai, xmai, alui, xhoi, and pvui individually. a specific fingerprint from the pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism method based on 16s rdna was obtained for each bacterium. the results showed that the method developed was useful not only for bacterial identification but also for the etiological investigation of pathogens in imported animal hair and wool.

TI  == [effect of phytosubstances with antioxidant activity on persistence properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the in vitro effect of phytosubstances containing flavonoids and phenylpropanoids on the antilysozyme activity of varioous groups of microorganisms, such as staphylococci, bacilli, enterobacteria and nonfermenting bacteria was studied. the second fraction of the pink carbonic acid extract showed high antioxidant activity and most efficiently inhibited the ability of various microorganisms to  inactivate the host lysozyme. the selected phytosubstance could be useful in clinical practice as an additional antimicrobial agent in etiotropic therapy or prophylaxis of some infections.

TI  == an investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  == in 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the uk and ireland was reported and clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to c. botulinum and bacillus cereus were also reported. because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in england during 2000 and 2002. two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. the first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (mrd) which was inoculated directly into clostridium botulinum isolation cooked meat broth (cbi). the second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in cbi broth. duplicate cbi broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees c for 30 min. subcultures were made after incubation for 7  and 14 days on to eight different solid media. the methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either c. botulinum or c. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the mrd suspension technique. fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. no fungi were isolated. aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus  spp. and paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at  least one species was isolated from each sample. b. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with b. licheniformis isolated  from 40%. between one and five samples yielded cultures of b. coagulans, b. laterosporus, b. pumilus, b. subtilis and p. macerans. staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; s. warneri and s. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. one or two samples yielded cultures of s. aureus, s. capitis and s. haemolyticus. the remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with c. perfringens and two samples with either c. sordellii or c. tertium. multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the  remaining 15. in 13 samples b. cereus alone was isolated, in one b. subtilis alone and in one sample b. pumilus alone. c. botulinum and c. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.

TI  == alkaline-fermented foods: a review with emphasis on pidan fermentation.
AB  == alkaline-fermented foods constitute a group of less-known food products that are  widely consumed in southeast asia and african countries. they can be made from different raw ingredients. for instance, japanese natto, thai thua-nao, and kinema are made from cooked soybeans, dawadawa from african locust beans, ogiri from melon seeds, ugba from african oil beans, kawal from fresh legale leaves, owoh from cotton seeds, and pidan from fresh poultry eggs. in alkaline-fermented  foods, the protein of the raw materials is broken down into amino acids and peptides; ammonia is released during the fermentation, raising the ph of the final products and giving the food a strong ammoniacal smell. most alkaline fermentations are achieved spontaneously by mixed bacteria cultures, principally  dominated by bacillus subtilis. in other cases, pure cultures can be used. for example, japanese natto is inoculated with a pure culture of b. subtilis var natto. pidan is a special example of alkaline fermentation. instead of using microorganisms, pidan is made using an alkali-treated fermentation. sodium hydroxide (naoh) is produced from the reaction of sodium carbonate (na2co3), water (h2o), and calcium oxide (cao) of pickle or coating mud. naoh penetrates into the eggs, causing the physicochemical changes, color changes, and gelation.  the appearance of pidan differs from fresh eggs in that the white becomes a semitransparent tea-brown color, and the yolk is solid or semisolid with a dark-green color. the nutritional value of pidan is slightly decreased compared with fresh eggs, but pidan has an extremely long shelf life and a pleasant, fragrant taste that is preferred by most people in southeast asian countries. in  a small-scale laboratory study conducted by the authors, b. subtilis was not found in pidan. four staphylococcus spp. (s. cohnii, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. warneri) and two strains of bacillus spp. (b. cereus and b.  macerans) were isolated from pidan. staphylococcus spp. did not contribute to the fermentation and were considered contaminants.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.
