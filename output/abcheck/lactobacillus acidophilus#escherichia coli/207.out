lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in sos-chromotest.
antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest.
the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz).
high genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media.
the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes.
antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.
