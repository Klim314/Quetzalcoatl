TI  == comparing the anterior nare bacterial community of two discrete human populations using illumina amplicon sequencing.
AB  == the anterior nares are an important reservoir for opportunistic pathogens and commensal microorganisms. a barcoded illumina paired-end sequencing method targeting the 16s ribosomal rna v1-2 hypervariable region was developed to compare the bacterial diversity of the anterior nares across distinct human populations (volunteers from germany vs a babongo pygmy tribe, africa). of the 251 phylotypes detected, 231 could be classified to the genus level and 109 to the species level, including the unambiguous identification of the ubiquitous staphylococcus aureus and moraxella catarrhalis. the global bacterial community of both adult populations revealed that they shared 85% of the phylotypes, suggesting that our global bacterial communities have likely been with us for thousands of years. of the 34 phylotypes unique to the non-westernized population, most were related to members within the suborder micrococcineae. there was an even more overwelming distinction between children and adults of the same population, suggesting a progression of a childhood community of high-diversity comprising species of moraxellaceae and streptococcaceae to an adult community of lower diversity comprising species of propionibacteriaceae, clostridiales incertae sedis xi, corynebacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae. thus,  age was a stronger factor for accounting for differing bacterial assemblages than the origin of the human population sampled.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == phylogenetic distribution and membrane topology of the lytr-cpsa-psr protein family.
AB  == background: the bacterial cell wall is the target of many antibiotics and cell envelope constituents are critical to host-pathogen interactions. to combat resistance development and virulence, a detailed knowledge of the individual factors involved is essential. members of the lytr-cpsa-psr family of cell envelope-associated attenuators are relevant for beta-lactam resistance, biofilm  formation, and stress tolerance, and they are suggested to play a role in cell wall maintenance. however, their precise function is still unknown. this study addresses the occurrence as well as sequence-based characteristics of the lytr-cpsa-psr proteins. results: a comprehensive list of lytr-cpsa-psr proteins was established, and their phylogenetic distribution and clustering into subgroups was determined. lytr-cpsa-psr proteins were present in all gram-positive organisms, except for the cell wall-deficient mollicutes and one strain of the clostridiales. in contrast, the majority of gram-negatives did not  contain lytr-cpsa-psr family members. despite high sequence divergence, the lytr-cpsa-psr domains of different subclusters shared a highly similar, predicted mixed a/beta-structure, and conserved charged residues. phoa fusion experiments,  using msrr of staphylococcus aureus, confirmed membrane topology predictions and  extracellular location of its lytr-cpsa-psr domain. conclusion: the lytr-cpsa-psr domain is unique to bacteria. the presence of diverse subgroups within the lytr-cpsa-psr family might indicate functional differences, and could explain variations in phenotypes of respective mutants reported. the identified conserved structural elements and amino acids are likely to be important for the function of the domain and will help to guide future studies of the lytr-cpsa-psr proteins.
