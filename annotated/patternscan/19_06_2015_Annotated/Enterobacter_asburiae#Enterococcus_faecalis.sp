TI  == treatment of sanitary-important bacteria by bacteriocin substance v24 in cattle dung water.
AB  == quantification of sanitary-important bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae), as well  as indicators of environmental contamination, was assessed in samples of cattle dung from 25 cattle farms in 15 north-eastern slovakia districts. the inhibitory  effect of crude bacteriocin extract cbe v24 from enterococcus faecalis v24 against listeria monocytogenes ohio and yersinia enterocolitica ye85 was examined in cattle dung water with the aim of finding a new way of eliminating the health  risk of the animal slurry. the following bacterial groups were quantified: salmonella spp., shigella-like spp. , proteus spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., pseudomonas spp. , escherichia coli, listeria spp., staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci (the average count ranged from 102 up to 104 cfu ml-1). antagonistic effect of the crude bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis v24 in the range of 100-600 arbitrary units per ml (au ml-1) was shown against the following bacteria: enterobacter cloacae, ent. asburiae, proteus spp., salmonella spp., acinetobacter lwoffi, l. monocytogenes as well as y. enterocolitica ye85. during tests performed to study the inhibitory effect of the crude bacteriocin cbe v24 (concentration 800, 1600 au ml-1) against l. monocytogenes ohio and y. enterocolitica ye85 in experimentally contaminated cattle dung, a reduction of 2.03 and 1.44 log cfu ml-1, respectively, was already noted after 1 h after crude bacteriocin cbe v24 addition.
