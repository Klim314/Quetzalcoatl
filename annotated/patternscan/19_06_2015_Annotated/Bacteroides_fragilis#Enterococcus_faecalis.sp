TI  == quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  == various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qpcr in a single cohort. we quantify these bacteria (fusobacterium  spp., streptococcus gallolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and afac-  or pks-positive e. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. we further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and msi-status. with the exception of s. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. etbf (fdr = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afac-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. etbf (fdr = 0.04 and  0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and fusobacterium spp. (fdr =  0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (iii/iv) colorectal cancers. fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). we also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by fusobacterium and msi-h (fdr = 0.05), age (fdr = 0.03) or pks-positive e. coli (fdr = 0.01). furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical epec in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. by quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of fusobacterium and etbf.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == differential susceptibility of bacteria to mouse paneth cell alpha-defensins under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == small intestinal paneth cells secrete alpha-defensin peptides, termed cryptdins (crps) in mice, into the intestinal lumen, where they confer immunity to oral infections and define the composition of the ileal microbiota. in these studies,  facultative bacteria maintained under aerobic or anaerobic conditions displayed differential sensitivities to mouse alpha-defensins under in vitro assay conditions. regardless of oxygenation, crps 2 and 3 had robust and similar bactericidal activities against s. typhimurium and s. flexneri, but crp4 activity against s. flexneri was attenuated in the absence of oxygen. anaerobic bacteria varied in their susceptibility to crps 2-4, with crp4 showing less activity than  crps 2 and 3 against enterococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis in anaerobic assays, but fusobacterium necrophorum was killed only by crp4 and not by crps 2 and 3. the influence of anaerobiosis in modulating crp bactericidal activities in vitro suggests that alpha-defensin effects on the enteric microbiota may be subject to regulation by local oxygen tension.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == evaluation of detachment methods for the enumeration of bacteroides fragilis in sediments via propidium monoazide quantitative pcr, in comparison with enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli.
AB  == aims: the aim was to develop an optimized detachment method for separating bacteroidales from sediments to allow enumeration via pma-qpcr. the effectiveness of four different detachment treatments in removing bacteroides fragilis was compared as a function of time as well as in relation to enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli as detected by cultivation and qpcr. methods and results: cells were inoculated into four sediments from sea water (sw) and freshwater (fw) beaches. sediment samples were taken on days 1 and 7 and subjected to four different treatments for separation of micro-organisms. on day 1, the detachment  treatments performed equally well in removing intact bact. fragilis cells. in contrast, 7 days later the detachment treatment with tween 80 and handshaking (th) resulted in up to eightfold higher 16s rrna gene concentrations of intact and total bact. fragilis cells compared to other detachment treatments. total ent. faecalis cells based on the 23s rrna gene were also preferentially recovered by treatment th. cultivable ent. faecalis or e. coli numbers detached from sediments were similar for all methods in most sediments tested. conclusions: handshaking and 1% tween 80/naoh (ph 7.0) eluant was the most efficient technique to recover intact as well as total bact. fragilis cells in sediment samples with  different salinities and after prolonged sediment cell contact time. significance and impact of the study: the optimized detachment method enables the application  of pma-qpcr to sediment samples to detect the presence of bacteroidales cells and their dna in future microbial source tracking studies.

TI  == the interplay between the innate immune system and the microbiota.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract harbors one of the highest densities of microorganisms on earth, called the microbiota. in fact, the number of microbial  cells in the intestine outnumbers the amount of human cells of the entire organism by a factor of 10. as such, a human being is more and more perceived as  a super-organism consisting of a eukaryotic and a prokaryotic part. the compartment mediating the communication between both parts is the innate immune system and its various microbe-sensing pattern-recognition receptors. co-evolution of the microbiota with the innate immune system has resulted in elaborate interdependency and feedback mechanisms by which both systems control mutual homeostasis. here, we review the most important innate immune-microbiota interdependencies known to date. while microbial sensing by pattern-recognition receptors is required for stable microbial composition, the presence of the microbiota, in turn, is necessary for proper development and function of the immune system.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == arda proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the ecoki type i dna methyltransferase of e. coli k12.
AB  == anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-rm) is the ability to prevent cleavage by dna restriction-modification (rm) systems of foreign dna entering a new bacterial host. the evolutionary consequence of anti-rm is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. homologues of arda anti-rm proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. the arda proteins cause anti-rm by mimicking the dna structure bound by type i rm enzymes. we have investigated arda proteins from the genomes of enterococcus faecalis v583, staphylococcus aureus mu50 and bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343, and compared them  to the arda protein expressed by the conjugative transposon tn916. we find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the ecoki methyltransferase, a core component of the ecoki type i rm system. this finding indicates that the less structured arda  proteins become fully folded upon binding. the ability of arda from diverse mobile elements to inhibit type i rm systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but  also between more distantly related bacterial species.

TI  == protection of enterococcus faecalis in mixed cultures with carbapenemase-producing escherichia coli and bacteroide fragilis: effect of the bacterial load.
AB  == introduction: this study explores effects of ph and inoculum size on imipenem versus tigecycline activity against e. coli, b. fragilis and e. faecalis, both in individual and mixed cultures. methods: mic/mbcs (mg/l) of tigecycline and imipenem were 0.12/>/= 16 and 4/4 for e. coli, 0.12/0.5 and >/= 16/>/= 16 for b.  fragilis, and 0.12/>/= 16 and 2/>/= 16 for e. faecalis, respectively. killing curves in supplemented brucella broth were performed at ph 7 or 5.8, with two final inocula ( approximately 105 or approximately 107 cfu/ml) of each isolate (individual cultures) and with 1:1:1 mixed inocula. tubes were 48 h incubated at  37 masculinec in anaerobiosis. final concentrations (estimated concentrations in  colon) were 1.50 mg/l for tigecycline and 26.40 mg/l for imipenem, with antibiotic-free curves as controls. experiments were performed in triplicate. results: imipenem showed inoculum effect against e.coli and b. fragilis, with reductions in initial inocula in experiments with standard inocula contrasting with increases in experiments with high inocula (both individual and mixed cultures). against e. faecalis no inoculum effect for imipenem was observed in individual cultures, with marked reductions in initial inocula regardless inoculum size. however in mixed experiments the indirect protection of e. faecalis by the two gramnegatives resulted in bacterial regrowth. this protection was inoculum-dependant since it occurred with high but not with standard inocula. tigecycline reduced initial inocula of the three isolates regardless culture type (individual/mixed) or experimental conditions (ph/inocula size), with lower reductions for the tolerant e. faecalis. conclusion: carbapenemase activity was inoculum-dependant for self-protection and indirect protection of e. faecalis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == background and aims: to prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. the present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. methods: rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. in addition, binding of amps to mucins was investigated by western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays.  results: in functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. we detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins hbd-1 and -3, the cathelicidin ll-37, ubiquitin,  lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. amps were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. conclusion: these findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing  their efficacy. thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.

TI  == nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (ssi) in japan.
AB  == to investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (ssi), a japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. seven main organisms were collected from ssi at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. a total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with ssi were included. staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and enterococcus faecalis  (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4  %) and bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). methicillin-resistant s. aureus among s. aureus was 72.0 %. vancomycin mic 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. in escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). of e. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (caz) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (cpfx). no p. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. in p. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4  % to tazobactam/piperacillin (taz/pipc), 10.2 % to imipenem (ipm), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and cpfx, and 0 % to gentamicin. in the b. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to taz/pipc and ipm, and 0 % to metronidazole (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0  %). mic(9)(0) of p. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in taz/pipc, caz, ipm, and cpfx. in patients with american society of anesthesiologists (asa) score >/=3, the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa to taz/pipc and caz were higher than in patients with asa </=2. the data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause ssi. timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of metapex (calcium hydroxide with iodoform formulation) at different concentrations against selected microorganisms--an in vitro study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess, in vitro, the effectiveness of several concentrations of metapex (0.22 gm/ml, 0.022 gm/ml, 0.0022 gm/ml) in the elimination of selected microorganisms. different concentrations of metapex were  prepared by dissolving it in ethanol (99.9%) pre-sterilized whatman paper discs,  6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates. plates were incubated aerobically for enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) and candida albicans (c. albicans), anaerobically for bacteroid fragilis (b. fragilis) and propionibacterium acne respectivally. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. there was significant reduction in the size of zone  of inhibition against p. acne, as the concentration of metapex decreases. at lower concentrations of metapex there was no zone of inhibition observed against  e. faecalis, c. albicans and b. fragilis. the result of this study suggested that metapex is a potent antimicrobial agent at higher concentration.

TI  == effects of potato fiber and potato-resistant starch on biomarkers of colonic health in rats fed diets containing red meat.
AB  == the effects of red meat consumption with and without fermentable carbohydrates on indices of large bowel health in rats were examined. sprague-dawley rats were fed cellulose, potato fiber, or potato-resistant starch diets containing 12% casein for 2 wk, then similar diets containing 25% cooked beef for 6 wk. after week 8, cecal and colonic microbiota composition, fermentation end-products, colon structure, and colonocyte dna damage were analyzed. rats fed potato fiber had lower bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group compared to other diet groups. colonic bifidobacterium spp. and/or lactobacillus spp. were higher in potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets than in the cellulose diet. beneficial changes were observed in short-chain fatty acid concentrations (acetic, butyric,  and propionic acids) in rats fed potato fiber compared with rats fed cellulose. phenol and p-cresol concentrations were lower in the cecum and colon of rats fed  potato fiber. an increase in goblet cells per crypt and longer crypts were found  in the colon of rats fed potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets. fermentable carbohydrates had no effect on colonic dna damage. dietary combinations of red meat with potato fiber or potato-resistant starch have distinctive effects in the large bowel. future studies are essential to examine the efficacy of different types of nondigestible carbohydrates in maintaining colonic health during long-term consumption of high-protein diets. practical application: improved understanding of interactions between the food consumed and gut microbiota provides knowledge needed to make healthier food choices for large bowel health. the impact of red meat on large bowel health may be ameliorated by  consuming with fermentable dietary fiber, a colonic energy source that produces less harmful by-products than the microbial breakdown of colonic protein for energy. developing functional red meat products with fermentable dietary fiber could be one way to promote a healthy and balanced macronutrient diet.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == a shift from colon- to ileum-predominant bacteria in ileal-pouch feces following  total proctocolectomy.
AB  == background: we previously investigated fecal flora of the pouch after total proctocolectomy using terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. although the results of the cluster analysis demonstrated clearly that bacterial  populations, including an unidentified bacteria generating a 213-bp pcr fragment, moved toward a colon-like community in the pouch, it did not track changes in the individual species of fecal bacteria. aims: the aim of the present study was to estimate genome copy number of ten bacterial species, clusters, groups, or subgroups (including the bacteria generating 213-bp fragment in the previous study) in feces samples from pouches at various times following ileostomy closure. methods: a total of 117 stool samples were collected from patients with  ulcerative colitis after surgery as well as healthy volunteers. we used real-time polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna gene to estimate genome copy numbers for the nine bacterial populations and the bacteria generating 213-bp fragment after identification by dna sequencing. results: we demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the number of anaerobic and colon-predominant bacteria (such as clostridium coccoides, c. leptum, bacteroides fragilis and atopobium) present in  proctocolectomy patients after stoma closure. in contrast, numbers of ileum-predominant bacterial species (such as lactobacillus and enterococcus faecalis) declined. conclusions: our data confirm previous findings that fecal flora in the pouch after total proctocolectomy changes significantly, and further demonstrate that the number and diversity of ileal bacteria decreases while a more colon-like community develops. the present data are essential for the future analysis of pathological conditions in the ileal pouch.

TI  == intestinal bacterial translocation in rats with cirrhosis is related to compromised paneth cell antimicrobial host defense.
AB  == liver cirrhosis is associated with bacterial translocation (bt) and endotoxemia.  most translocating bacteria belong to the common intestinal microbiota, suggesting a breakdown of intestinal barrier function. we hypothesized that diminished mucosal antimicrobial host defense could predispose to bt. two rodent  models of portal hypertension with increased bt were used, ccl(4)-induced ascitic cirrhosis and 2-day portal vein-ligated (pvl) animals. bt was assessed by standard microbiological techniques on mesenteric lymph nodes. total rna was isolated systematically throughout the intestinal tract, and expression of paneth cell alpha-cryptdins and beta-defensins was determined by real-time quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). to determine functional consequences, mucosal antimicrobial activity was assessed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. bt was detectable in 40% of rats with cirrhosis. compared with the group without bt, these animals exhibited diminished intestinal paneth cell alpha-cryptdin 5 and 7 expression. in contrast, pvl was associated with bt in all animals but did not affect antimicrobial peptides. the decrease in paneth cell antimicrobials was most pronounced in the ileum and the coecum. other antimicrobials showed no changes or even an induction in the case of bt at different sites. antimicrobial activity toward different commensal strains was reduced, especially in the distal ileum and the cecum in experimental cirrhosis with bt (excluding pvl). conclusion: compromised paneth cell antimicrobial host defense seems to predispose to bt in experimental cirrhosis. understanding this liver-gut axis including the underlying mechanisms could help us to find new treatment avenues.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated  from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated  at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 micrcog/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, vcm, teicoplanin, linezolid(lzd) and qpr/dpr had mic90s of < or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of e. faecalis strains or 3.5% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to lzd. 24.4% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr. against  all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm were under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity against c. difficile. carbapenems showed good activity against peptococcaceae, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. however since several strains of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the  future.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the colon: delivering a light punch to the  guts?
AB  == a paper in this issue of photochemistry and photobiology by cassidy et al. describes the use of a sophisticated drug delivery vehicle prepared by the hot melt extrusion process to deliver photosensitizers to the colon. the smart vehicle protects its cargo through the acidic environment of the stomach but releases the active photosensitizers in the higher ph and anaerobic environment of the colon. the goal is to use photodynamic therapy (pdt) to destroy pathogenic microorganisms that can cause disease when they grow out of control in the colon. since the colon is an environment with a low oxygen concentration the investigators also used tetrachlorodecaoxide, an oxygen donor to boost the available oxygen concentration. the paper reports results with enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis but the real medical problem demanding to be solved is clostridium difficile that can cause intractable drug-resistant infections after antibiotic use. there still remain barriers to implementing this strategy in vivo, including light delivery to the upper colon, oxygen availability and optimizing the selectivity of photosensitizers for bacteria over colon epithelial cells. nevertheless, this highly innovative paper lays the ground for the study of an entirely new and significant application for antimicrobial pdt.

TI  == development of novel oral formulations prepared via hot melt extrusion for targeted delivery of photosensitizer to the colon.
AB  == colon-residing bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis, can cause a range of serious clinical infections. photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (pact) may be a novel treatment option for these multidrug resistant organisms. the aim of this study was to formulate a eudragit(r)-based drug delivery system, via hot melt extrusion (hme), for targeting colonic release of photosensitizer. the susceptibility of e. faecalis and b. fragilis to pact mediated by methylene blue (mb), meso-tetra(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine tetra-tosylate (tmp), or 5-aminolevulinic  acid hexyl-ester (h-ala) was determined, with tetrachlorodecaoxide (tcdo), an oxygen-releasing compound, added in some studies. results show that, for mb, an average of 30% of the total drug load was released over a 6-h period. for tmp and h-ala, these values were 50% and 16% respectively. no drug was released in the acidic media. levels of e. faecalis and b. fragilis were reduced by up to 4.67 and 7.73 logs, respectively, on pact exposure under anaerobic conditions, with increased kill associated with tcdo. with these formulations, photosensitizer release could potentially be targeted to the colon, and colon-residing pathogens  killed by pact. tcdo could be used in vivo to generate oxygen, which could significantly impact on the success of pact in the clinic.

TI  == intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis b virus infection. intestinal microbiota of hbv cirrhotic patients.
AB  == to unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis b virus (hbv), chronic hepatitis b, decompensated hbv cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative pcr and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and clostridium perfringens in fecal crude dna and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. data analysis indicated that 16s rrna gene copy numbers for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of hbv cirrhotic patients. the bifidobacteria/enterobacteriaceae (b/e) ratio, which may  indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis b to  0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated hbv cirrhosis (for all, p < 0.01). this suggests that b/e ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. the data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. fecal secretory iga and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated hbv cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation is required for maintenance of innate antimicrobial immunity in the colon.
AB  == crohn's disease (cd), a major form of human inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by primary immunodeficiencies. the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppargamma) is essential for intestinal homeostasis in response to both dietary- and microbiota-derived signals. its role in host defense remains unknown, however. we show that ppargamma functions as an  antimicrobial factor by maintaining constitutive epithelial expression of a subset of beta-defensin in the colon, which includes mdefb10 in mice and defb1 in humans. colonic mucosa of ppargamma mutant animals shows defective killing of several major components of the intestinal microbiota, including candida albicans, bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli. neutralization of the colicidal activity using an anti-mdefb10 blocking antibody  was effective in a ppargamma-dependent manner. a functional promoter variant that is required for defb1 expression confers strong protection against crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (odds ratio, 0.559; p = 0.018). consistently, colonic involvement in cd is specifically linked to reduced expression of defb1 independent of inflammation. these findings support the development of ppargamma-targeting therapeutic and/or nutritional approaches to prevent colonic  inflammation by restoring antimicrobial immunity in cd.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == bacterial indicators of pollution of the douala lagoon, cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == background: indiscriminate disposal of untreated wastes which are often heavily laden with sewage microorganisms some of which are pathogenic to humans into aquatic environments near cities could serve as potential dangers to human health. objective: a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the scope of potential bacterial pathogens and to assess the extent of pollution of the douala lagoon. methods: a total of eighty water samples were collected fortnightly from  the lagoon at five stations from march to october 2005 and analysed for heterotrophic bacterial densities, coliform counts, faecal coliform and faecal streptococcal counts. bacteria were isolated and identified using standard microbiology and biochemical techniques. results: high heterotrophic bacterial counts (33 x 10(5) - 161 x 10(5) cfu/ ml), total coliform counts (1.8 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/100 ml), faecal coliform counts (2.2 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/ 100 ml) and faecal streptococcal counts (2.1 x 102 - 2.3 x 10(2) cfu/100ml were observed in all sampling stations. eleven species of bacteria: bacteroides fragilis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus mycoides and serratia marcesens, were frequently isolated. conclusion: the presence of potential bacterial agents such as bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli in the lagoon may pose a serious threat to the health and  well being of users of the lagoon and calls for urgent intervention.

TI  == infection after elective colorectal surgery: bacteriological analysis of failures in a randomized trial of cefotetan vs. ertapenem prophylaxis.
AB  == background: a randomized study comparing single-dose cefotetan and ertapenem prophylaxis for elective colorectal surgery in 1,002 patients found ertapenem to  be significantly more effective (p < 0.001). failures of prophylaxis were thought to involve organisms resistant to both antimicrobial agents, isolated most often  from deep or superficial incision sites. methods: further testing and analysis of the microbial data was performed. susceptibility results were correlated with the clinical outcomes reported previously. results: of the 216 aerobes tested, 62.6%  were resistant to cefotetan and 44% to ertapenem. enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were the aerobes recovered most  frequently, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium innocuum, and eubacterium lentum were the most frequent anaerobes. enterococcus faecalis usually was associated in mixed culture with bacteroides fragilis group species.  approximately one-half of the 158 anaerobes (50.7%), including all the species above, were resistant to cefotetan; most of these (61.4%) came from superficial incision sites. only one anaerobe (desulfovibrio fairfieldensis), found in a superficial incisional infection, was resistant to ertapenem, and no ertapenem-resistant enteric bacteria were recovered. in vitro resistance was associated with therapeutic failure. conclusions: the in vitro activity of ertapenem was superior to that of cefotetan against all anaerobic and many aerobic bacteria isolated from postoperative cultures of patients who failed prophylaxis with these agents. our findings help to elucidate the results of the  clinical trial.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

AB  == previously reported and redesigned primer and probe assays were evaluated for the quantitative analysis of the fecal indicator bacterial groups, enterococcus and bacteroidetes with three real-time pcr instrument and reagent systems. the efficiency and sensitivity of the original assays varied between systems in analyses of dna extracts from pure cultures of enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis, whereas the modified assays gave more consistent results. distinctions between original and modified assays also occurred in analyses of known spike levels of e. faecalis and b. fragilis cells on filters with diverse surface water retentates. percentages of samples causing pcr failures due to inhibition were lower using the modified assays. the accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements were also generally higher, although mean measurements of both target organisms were still significantly different between  systems (p < 0.05). the accuracy and precision of spiked bacteria measurements by both modified assays were further improved using a new sample matrix control spike consisting of cultured lactococcus lactis cells and a reference assay for this organism. corrections provided by the l. lactis assay eliminated significant differences in e. faecalis measurements between all three systems and between two of the three systems in b. fragilis measurements.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  == research to understand and remediate coastal pollution is moving toward a multitiered approach in which traditional enumeration of fecal indicators is accompanied by molecular analysis of a variety of targets. technology that rapidly detects multiple microbial contaminants would benefit from such an approach. the luminex 100 system is a suspension array that assays multiple analytes rapidly in a single well of a microtiter plate. the ability of the system to simultaneously detect multiple fecal indicating bacteria in environmental samples was tested. primer/probe sets were designed to simultaneously detect the following fecal indicators: the bacteroides fragilis group, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli and shigella spp., bacteroides distasonis, and ent. faecalis. specificity and sensitivity of the luminex probes  was tested against laboratory cultures. in addition, sequencing, culture plate testing, and specificity testing with environmental isolates were steps taken to  validate the function of the assay with environmental samples. luminex response to cultures and to environmental samples was consistent with sequencing results,  suggesting that the technology has the potential to simultaneously detect multiple targets for coastal water quality applications, particularly as progress is made to efficiently extract dna from water and sediment matrices.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == comparative evaluation of antimicrobial action of mta, calcium hydroxide and portland cement.
AB  == the present study aimed to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of mta dentsply, mta angelus, calcium hydroxide and portland cement. four reference bacterial strains were used: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and enterococcus faecalis. plates containing mueller-hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood, hemin, and menadione were inoculated with  the bacterial suspensions. subsequently, wells were prepared and immediately filled with materials and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours under anaerobic  conditions, except p. aeruginosa. the diameters of inhibition zones were measured, and data analyzed using anova and the tukey test with 1% level of significance. mta dentsply, mta angelus and portland cement inhibited the growth  of p. aeruginosa. calcium hydroxide was effective against p. aeruginosa and b. fragillis. under anaerobic conditions, which may hamper the formation of reactive oxygen species, the materials failed to inhibit e. faecalis, and e. coli.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == [therapeutic management of peritonitis].
AB  == antibiotherapy is a fundamental for the treatment of peritonitis. it may be used  before surgery or as a complementary treatment after. experimental models have demonstrated that infections are both aerobic and anaerobic. during the first stage, septicemic with a high death rate, the infection is due to enterobacteria, mostly escherichia coli. between d5 and d7 in surviving animals, there is a second stage with abscesses due to anaerobic bacteria, mostly bacteroides fragilis. the antibiotic treatment must include these two types of bacteria in its spectrum. the role of enterococcus faecalis is not clearly defined, but this  bacterium must be taken into account in case of organ failure or associated septic shock. treatment options for secondary peritonitis may be, according to severity, cefoxitin, an augmentin + gentamycin combination, tazocillin, or ertapenem. the reference treatment for nosocomial or tertiary peritonitis is the  imipenem + amikacin combination. an antifungal treatment (fluconazole) is usually necessary, at least until the results of peritoneal fluid culture are available.  the duration of treatment is quite variable, ranging from 48 h in less severe forms to 14 days.

TI  == toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  == the colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through toll-like receptors (tlr). the colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mrna for tlr3 and less for tlr2 and -4. little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern  recognition receptors in human colon. the aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. tlr2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen.  in contrast, tlr3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. ht29 and caco-2 had different levels of expression for tlr1-4. co-culture of ht29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mrna for tlr1-4. in contrast, caco-2 cells were  refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mrna levels. tlr3 was induced in ht29 only by gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mrna and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. this pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the  crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. in contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.

AB  == objective: to explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. methods: observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (nt). results: (1) model bile were suitable for the growth of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and clostridium. propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == whole blood-mediated endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression: a model study into the effects of bacteria and antibiotics.
AB  == aim: to investigate whether the inflammatory response of cultured endothelial cells, as induced by conditioned plasma, depends on the bacterial species or type of antibiotic used for incubation with whole blood. materials and methods: blood  from healthy volunteers was stimulated ex vivo with different microorganisms, and with bacteria killed with different antibiotics. the resultant plasmas were incubated on monolayers of cultured human endothelial cells, followed by measurement of their permeability to albumin and expression of e-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. results: incubation of escherichia coli in blood yielded plasmas that induced a marked increase in endothelial permeability  and e-selectin expression. the response to bacteroides fragilis or enterococcus faecalis was generally weaker. similar effects were observed after incubation of  whole blood with lipopolysaccharide (lps). much of the permeability and adhesion  molecule response to e. coli remained after removal of intact microorganisms from the culture. whereas antibiotic treatment of e. coli with imipenem or cefuroxime  resulted in a divergent production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in blood, no significant differences between these treatments were observed with respect to the plasma-induced endothelial response. conclusion: bacteria differ in their capacity to generate a whole blood-mediated increase of endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression; this response depends, at least in part, on the presence of soluble bacterial components, such as lps. whereas treatment with various antibiotics may generate varying amounts of tnf-alpha, these differences are not translated into differences in endothelial permeability or adhesion molecule expression.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of pefloxacin plus metronidazole after administration as surgical prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.
AB  == the levels of metronidazole and pefloxacin in plasma and tissue penetration of both drugs were studied after prophylactic administration to 7 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. metronidazole (1,500 mg) and pefloxacin (800 mg) were administered as an intravenous infusion 1 hour before surgery. mean plasma levels of pefloxacin decreased from 12.92 +/- 4.10 microg/ml at the end of the infusion to 2.18 +/- 1.03 microg/ml at 36 h. these values were above the mic90 for e. coli (0.125 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (0.5 microg/ml), microorganisms responsible for abdominal infections. tissue pefloxacin levels were also measured with a range from 0.72 - 7.78 microg/g in subcutaneous cell tissue, from 1.94 - 17.55 microg/g in peritoneum and from 2.76 - 21.99 microg/g in colon wall. mean plasma concentrations of metronidazole decreased from 39.89 +/- 17.08 microg/ml at the end of the infusion to 2.63 +/- 1.11 microg/ml at 36 h. during this period, concentrations were higher than 2 microg/ml, the mic90 value for b. fragilis, the anaerobic pathogen more frequently involved in postoperative infections after rectal and colonic surgery. tissue metronidazole levels ranged from 3.64 - 13.37 microg/g in subcutaneous cell tissue, from 3.26 - 41.66 microg/g in peritoneum and from 6.72 - 43.12 microg/g in colon wall. the auc/mic  values (efficacy parameter for concentration-dependent killing antibiotics such as pefloxacin and metronidazole) obtained were the following: metronidazole auc/mic value for b. fragilis was 173; pefloxacin auc/mic values for e. coli and  e. faecalis were 941 and 235, respectively. the values of these parameters are higher than the recommended values to ensure efficacy, which means good exposure  of the antimicrobials to the microorganisms. in conclusion, the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole as prophylactic agents to prevent infections in patients undergoing colorectal surgery produce plasma and tissue levels above the mic values of the main pathogens responsible for this kind of infections.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

AB  == objective: to assess the consequences of different more or less selective treatments on the microbiological and inflammatory responses within the peritoneum. methods: the early effects of various antibiotic regimens were evaluated in a model of polymicrobial peritonitis with specifically prepared organisms. six regimens (amoxycillin plus gentamicin, pefloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin plus ornidazole, imipenem and imipenem plus gentamicin) were evaluated at 24 h and 3 days in a non-fatal model of peritonitis in rats achieved by implantation of a capsule containing escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus faecalis. results: therapies that disregarded several organisms were associated with persistence of the strains and an increased peritoneal inflammatory response within the peritoneum. in contrast, therapies active against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes were associated with decreases of all the inoculated organisms and a smaller inflammatory response. conclusion: therapies that disregarded the microorganisms implicated in peritoneal infection  are associated with delayed bacterial eradication. the persistence of these organisms within the peritoneal fluid might be involved in prolonged peritoneal inflammation. although it disregards enterococci, the standard therapy, represented by therapy against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes, demonstrates satisfactory effects towards all the inoculated organisms. this apparent contradiction could be related to mechanisms of bacterial synergy.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == lavage by laparoscopy fares better than lavage by laparotomy: experimental evidence.
AB  == background: although carbon dioxide (co2) pneumoperitoneum is proposed increasingly for treatment of secondary peritonitis, associated deleterious effects have been reported in experimental models, with the hypothesis that increased intraperitoneal pressure might facilitate bacterial translocation. the  purpose of this study was to compare the outcome (and qualitative microbiologic analysis) from peritonitis in rats after lavage by laparoscopy with the outcome after lavage by laparotomy. methods: after determination of the standard innoculum for this study in 30 animals, 120 male wistar rats received 1 ml of escherichi coli 10(6) colony-forming unit (cfu), bacteroides fragilis 10(7) cfu,  enterococcus faecalis 10(7) cfu in a sterile rat feces-barium sulfate suspension  adjuvant, were anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine, and then underwent peritoneal lavage by either laparotomy (n = 60) or laparoscopy (n = 60). the duration of peritonitis defined two groups: group a: duration less than 3 h (n =  20) and group b: duration 3 h or more (n = 40). both groups underwent successive  lavage with 10-ml aliquots (total, 50 ml) of 0.9% saline solution at 37 degrees c. five 2-ml samples of liquid lavage were drawn for culture and microbiologic analysis. blood (0.2 ml) and peritoneal liquid lavage samples were incubated 48 h at 37 degrees c and cultured. results: all the animals survived. mean duration of peritoneal lavage was 13.2 min (range, 6-25 min) for laparoscopy and 9.7 min (range, 6-15 min) and for laparotomy. the difference was not statistically significant. the mean duration of operation was significantly longer with laparoscopy than with laparotomy: 44.5 min (range, 35-62 min) and 25 min (range,  16-40 min), respectively (p = 0.0001). the collected lavage volumes were not statistically different: 48.5 ml (range, 40-54 ml) and 46.7 ml (range, 37-56 ml), respectively. no statistically significant differences were found between the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in terms of e. coli bacteremia, irrespective of peritonitis duration. the rates of positive blood culture for b. fragilis and e.  faecalis were signficantly lower after laparoscopy than after laparotomy, both in the overall group (p = 0.025 and p = 0.045, respectively) and when duration of peritonitis exceeded 3 h (p = 0.001 and p = 0.044, respectively). conclusions: in this animal model of secondary peritonitis, lavage by laparoscopy was associated  with less bacteremia for b. fragilis and e. faecalis than peritoneal lavage by laparotomy.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == efficacy of trovafloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic simulation of an intraabdominal infection.
AB  == an in vitro model simulating trovafloxacin concentrations in human serum after standard doses was used to investigate the activity of this drug with time against bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic concentrations used for each incubation period  were: 4.24 mg/l (0-1 h), 3.69 mg/l (1-3 h), 3.25 mg/l (3-6 h), 2.38 mg/l (6-8 h), 1.35 mg/l (8-24 h). a 99.9% initial inoculum reduction (> 3 log10 cfu/ml) was defined as bactericidal activity. bactericidal activity against these organisms was obtained with trovafloxacin after the first hour of incubation, and similar activity was obtained against b. fragilis, e. faecalis and s. aureus after 3 h, when they were tested individually. when the strains were tested as mixed culture, there was bactericidal activity against e. coli after 1 h incubation and after 3 h for s. aureus. this activity was observed against b. fragilis and e. faecalis after 6 h incubation in the mixed culture assays and after 3 h when organisms were tested individually. regrowth was not observed over a 24 h period. these data show that trovafloxacin might be effective in intraabdominal infections caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == microbiological and inflammatory effects of murine recombinant interleukin-10 in  two models of polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a protective effect of interleukin-10 (il-10) against the development of lethal shock has been demonstrated in various animal models. in contrast, the immunosuppressant properties of this mediator have been minimally evaluated in low-mortality models of infections. the clinical, microbiological, and inflammatory effects of murine recombinant il-10 (mril-10) therapy were evaluated in two models of peritonitis in rats, which differed in the degree of severity of peritoneal inflammation 3 days after inoculation of escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis with or without enterococcus faecalis. the severity of the disease remained unchanged compared to that in control animals. a dose-related decrease in the peritoneal phagocyte count was observed in the treated groups compared to the counts in control animals. the subsequent experiments were performed exclusively in the mixed gram-positive-gram negative model, which exhibits an intense and prolonged inflammatory response with similar criteria. the early effects of mril-10 (evaluated 6 h after inoculation), repeated injections of mril-10 (four doses injected from 0 to 9 h after bacterial challenge), and pretreatment (two doses injected 6 and 3 h before inoculation) were evaluated. the clinical and microbiological parameters remained unchanged in the treated animals. decreases in the peritoneal phagocyte count and the peritoneal concentration of tumor necrosis factor were observed following repeated injections of mril-10. in summary, our data suggest that mril-10 does not worsen the manifestations of sepsis. however, these results need to be confirmed in clinical practice.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501  (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.

TI  == therapeutic effects of cefluprenam (cflp) on polymicrobial infections associated  with enterococcus faecalis in rat pyometra model.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis plays an important role as one of the pathogens in polymicrobial infections. we evaluated the efficacy of cefluprenam (cflp) using a polymicrobial pyometra of a model rat. rats were infected with a mixed intrauterine inoculation of e. faecalis plus either bacteroides fragilis or prevotella bivia (minimal inhibitory concentration of cflp: e. faecalis, 3.13 mug/ml; b. fragilis, 3.13 mug/ml; p. bivia, 3.13 mug/ml). immediately after inoculating 10(5) cfu/rat of each organism, cflp (either 40 mg/kg, i.v., q.i.d. for 5 days or 80 mg/kg, i.v., b.i.d. for 5 days) was administered. the intrauterine inflammatory change and bacterial count in the treated group were compared with those in the non-treated control group. cflp significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the bacterial counts except for b. fragilis in the regimen of 80  mg/kg, b.i.d. however, the regimen of 40 mg/kg, q.i.d. significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the bacterial counts more than did that of 80 mg/kg, b.i.d. cflp proved to demonstrate a good tissue concentration above 3 mug/g for 1 h. these results suggest that cflp in a more divided dose is efficacious for the treatment of polymicrobial infections associated with e. faecalis in pyometra.

TI  == tissue penetration of meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. the median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/ml. the median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. these tissue concentrations exceed the mics of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. a single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by  susceptible pathogens.

TI  == comparison of the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == owing to the broad spectrum of activity afforded by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor preparations, these agents are frequently selected as empiric therapy for the treatment of mixed infections such as intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections, either alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, four-way crossover trial comparing the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against microorganisms commonly isolated from mixed infections. subjects received the following regimes: (i) 3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam intravenously (i.v.) every 6 h (q6h) (ii) 4.5  g of piperacillin-tazobactam i.v. q8h, (iii) 3.1 g of ticarcillin-clavulanate i.v. q6h, and (iv) 3.0 g of ampicillin-sulbactam i.v. q6h. serum bactericidal titers were determined and used to calculate the duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval of each of the regimens against two clinical isolates of bacillus fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the percentage of the dosing interval over  which drug concentrations in serum remained above the mic for each organism was determined and compared with the observed duration of bactericidal activity was noted (r = 0.78; p < 0.001). all of the regimens demonstrated good activity against b. fragilis and e. coli. against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, however,  all of the regimens provided bactericidal activity for less than 50% of the respective dosing intervals. these data suggest that use of shorter dosing intervals or continuous-infusion regimens should be considered in combination with an aminoglycoside to improve the bactericidal profiles of these agents for e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial flora in patients after intraabdominal surgical procedures throughout a 12 year period].
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the bacterial flora in 295 patients who underwent surgical treatment in our clinic throughout the period of 12 years. 448 specimens were bacteriologically examined. bacterial pathogens were isolated from 390 (87.1%). among aerobic bacteria, enterococcus faecalis was the most often isolated (35.6% - from the peritoneum, 17.8% from the wound). among anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis - 44.9% were the most often isolated. 530 aerobic bacterial strains from enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus and the nonfermentable rods were carefully analysed. special attention was paid to the development of the resistance to 3 antibiotics (cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin and gentamycin) in 3 time periods: from 1984 to 1987, from 1988 to 1992 and from 1993 to 1996. resistance of the bacterial strains to cefoperazone was 38.7% in the first time period; 39.5% in the second;  and later increased to 53.8%. resistance to ciprofloxacin was identical in the first two periods - 10.3%; and subsequently, it increased to 22.6%. the increase  of resistance to gentamycin was the most significant--it went up from 24.5% to 44.8 and then dropped to 40.3%. conclusion: constant monitoring of the bacterial  flora enables rational antibiotic application, which is essential due to the observed increase of bacteria strain resistance.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == evidence of the proinflammatory role of enterococcus faecalis in polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  == although the role of members of the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes in the pathogenesis of intra-abdominal infections has been extensively demonstrated, the role played by enterococci in these infections remains controversial. the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by enterococci in intra-abdominal infection were studied in a nonfatal model of peritonitis in rats by implanting a gelatin capsule containing escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis with or without increasing concentrations of enterococcus faecalis or heat-inactivated enterococci. the ability of the rat peritoneal cavity to sterilize itself after bacterial challenge was evaluated by quantifying the inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity, reflected by both phagocyte and cytokine responses. effects were evaluated 6, 12, and 24 h and 3 and 6 days after inoculation. on day 6 after inoculation, the highest enterococcal concentration (10(8) cfu/ml) was accompanied by significantly increased concentrations of e. coli in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal phagocytes when compared to other groups. in the first 12 h  after inoculation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 concentrations were significantly increased in the peritoneal fluid of the animals that had received  the highest inoculum of enterococci or heat-inactivated enterococci. in the late  period of the study (3 and 6 days), significantly increased leukocyte counts were observed in the peritoneal fluid of these animals. these results suggest that e.  faecalis somehow inhibited phagocytosis and intracellular killing of the other pathogens and also played an inflammatory role, which might account for the bacterial synergy observed in this model.

TI  == detection by pcr of the nim genes encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance in bacteroides spp.
AB  == a pcr method was developed for detection of the nim genes encoding 5-nitrolmidazole resistance in bacteroides spp. two pcr primers specific for nim  genes were designed. they allowed amplification of a 458-bp fragment from all characterized plasmid- and chromosome-borne metronidazole resistance genes. the specificity of the method was tested with dna from metronidazole-sensitive bacteroides spp. strains and from other strains of unrelated species. each dna preparation was analyzed with and without an internal positive control to verify  that the absence of pcr amplification product was not due to inhibition of the taq polymerase inhibitors. by this technique, two newly discovered metronidazole-resistant clinical strains of bacteroides fragilis were shown to harbor resistance genes undetectable by southern blotting. in spite of the sequence divergence of the nim genes, the pcr method is thus suitable for epidemiological investigations. the amplification method also revealed that nim-related resistance genes were not present in either streptomyces strain s6670, a natural producer of 2-nitroimidazole, or in enterococcus faecalis strains, which have been suggested to possess metronidazole-inactivating enzyme.

AB  == background & aims: enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured ht-29  enterocytes. experiments were designed to determine the effect of b. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. methods: confluent ht-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with b. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, salmonella typhimurium (two strains), listeria monocytogenes (three strains), proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (three strains), and enterococcus faecalis. enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. results: b. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of l. monocytogenes (p < 0.01) but increased (p < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. conclusions: b. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with ht-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially  adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.

AB  == background: t-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. to prevent these, the choice of t-tube material may be of importance. methods: transected common bile ducts (cbds) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone t-tubes, or without a t-tube. results: after 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 cbds with and in 1 of 5 cbds without a t-tube (p < 0.05). by scanning electron microscopy (sem) four of five latex and none of five silicone t-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). all tubes remained patent. segments of t-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. sonication and sem showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to t-tubes. two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). conclusions: silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. less infectious complications occur if t-tubes are omitted.

TI  == liver biopsy in liver transplantation: no additional risk of infections in patients with choledochojejunostomy.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to determine whether there is an increased infectious risk following liver biopsy in liver transplant patients with choledochojejunostomy. methods: we evaluated the incidence of liver-biopsy-related sepsis in a consecutive series of 27 patients who underwent  choledochojejunostomy, either during the transplant procedure (17 patients) or later following biliary complications (10 patients). we evaluated another 138 patients as a control group who had orthotopic liver transplantation during the same period and underwent duct-to-duct anastomosis. all liver biopsies had routine, prior ultrasound evaluation to detect dilated biliary ducts. results: in the 27 patients who underwent choledochojejunostomy, 96 liver biopsies were performed: the sepsis rate was 3.12% per biopsy (n = 96) or 7.4% per patient (n = 27). however, despite a normal ultrasound, subsequent ercp demonstrated biliary obstruction in one patient. thus the rate of sepsis was 2.1% per biopsy or 3.7 per patient. in the control group 338 liver biopsies were performed: the sepsis rate was 1.5% per biopsy (n = 338) or 2.9% per patient (n = 138). the difference  was not significant. all septic episodes had positive blood cultures for a single enteric microorganism, and all responded to antibiotics conclusions: our data do  not suggest that liver-transplanted patients with choledochojejunostomy are more  at risk of sepsis following liver biopsy, providing there is no "occult" biliary  obstruction; therefore, they do not require prophylactic antibiotics as has been  suggested by other authors.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == in vitro activity of wy-49605, a penem antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial wy-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. wy-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family enterobacteriaceae. most strains of enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bioavailability and bacterial degradation of rectally administered 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine.
AB  == 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cda) is a new drug for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other lymphoproliferative diseases. it is generally administered as  a continuous intravenous infusion during 5-7 days. the oral bioavailability is only 50%. the bioavailability after rectal administration was investigated in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. five milligrams per square metre was  given i.v. as a 2-h infusion and 24 h later the same dose was administered rectally in a gel formulation. the mean bioavailability was only 21% due to deglycosylation of cda to 2-chloroadenine (cade). to further elucidate the factors which are important for the rectal availability of cda, the in vitro stability of cda in bacterial cultures was tested. clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli as well as whole feces rapidly deglycosylated cda to cade while  bacteroides fragilis, enterococcus faecalis as well as saliva only degraded cda slowly or not at all. it is concluded that, due to bacterial degradation, rectal  administration of cda has no advantage over oral administration.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == [effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == the effect of s-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and pediatric patients. s-1108 in a fine granular form was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. the viable fecal bacterial cell count of each of these 4 species of bacteria was slightly reduced in 5 days after the start of  the drug administration. five boys (weighing 12.0 to 42.0 kg) with bacterial infections were entered into this pediatric study. their ages ranged from 2 years 4 months to 9 years 3 months. s-1108 (fine granules) was administered at a dose of 2.3 to 6.0 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 5 to 11 days. cell counts of primary aerobes, anaerobes and total anaerobic cells decreased markedly in three patients, but in the remaining two patients the total number of aerobic and anaerobic cells did not change appreciably. glucose-nonfermentating gram-negative rods did not become predominant during the period of s-1108 administration. candida became predominant in the three patients in whom the other bacteria had markedly decreased. counts of predominant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased markedly during the regimen in 3 out of 5 cases. s-1006 was detected in stools of the 3 cases at concentrations ranging from 235 to 516 micrograms/g during the administration of s-1108. intestinal bacteria that produce beta-lactamase were not present in the feces of any of the patients. based on these results, s-1108 (fine granules) appears to have relatively little effect on intestinal bacterial flora similarly to other new oral cephems. because of individual differences, however, the drug may be excreted in the feces at high concentrations, and this would result in changes in intestinal bacterial flora. therefore, attention must be given to fecal drug concentrations.

TI  == a prospective randomized trial of imipenem-cilastatin versus clindamycin/tobramycin in the treatment of intra-abdominal and pelvic infections.
AB  == objective: a canadian multicentre clinical trial in the treatment of intra-abdominal and pelvic infections to compare the efficacy and safety of monotherapy using imipenem-cilastatin (imipenem) (500 mg intravenously every 6 h) versus combination therapy with clindamycin/tobramycin (clindamycin 600 mg intravenously every 6 h and tobramycin 1.7 mg/kg intravenously every 8 h). methods: two hundred and fifty patients were entered (88 definite and 162 possible infections) and all were evaluable for analysis of adverse events and intention to treat analysis of efficacy. dichotomous outcomes used were: cured versus noncured (improved, failed, relapsed). results: no statistically significant differences were found with the intention to treat analysis (p=0.88)  or with definite infections (p=0.81). for overall bacteriological response, no significant differences were noted (p=0.1). eleven and 15 patients on imipenem and clindamycin/tobramycin, respectively, were colonized with bacteria. enterococci colonized four of 11 imipenem cases and five of 15 clindamycin/tobramycin cases while fungi colonized six patients on imipenem and four on clindamycin/tobramycin. five patients on imipenem and seven on clindamycin/tobramycin developed superinfection. in the imipenem group, one case  had a bacterial superinfection while four cases were due to candida albicans. seven of seven superinfections on clindamycin/tobramycin were bacterial. three bacteria initially sensitive to the assigned study drug developed resistance. in  two patients on imipenem, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa became resistant after 14 and 10 days of therapy, respectively. on clindamycin/tobramycin, one instance of bacteroides fragilis resistance after eight days of therapy was seen. eighty-three adverse events occurred; 47 in the imipenem group and 36 in the clindamycin/tobramycin group. this resulted in discontinuation of antibacterial therapy in 13 patients, seven of whom were on imipenem and six on clindamycin/tobramycin. comparison of adverse effects showed  statistically significant differences for nausea (p=0.02) and hepatotoxicity (p=0.05) occurring with greater frequency in the imipenem and clindamycin/tobramycin groups, respectively. conclusions: these data support the  conclusion that monotherapy with imipenem (500 mg intravenously every 6 h) is as  efficacious as clindamycin/tobramycin for treatment of intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. both regimens are well tolerated.

TI  == female genital tract abscess formation in the rat. use of pathogens including enterococci.
AB  == previous animal experiments utilizing bowel flora have demonstrated synergy between various aerobes and anaerobes in the formation of intraabdominal abscesses. in these experiments, human female genital tract isolates were inserted into the abdominal and pelvic cavities of 151 female sprague-dawley rats. inoculation with any single species of organism--streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae or bacteroides bivius or a combination of two facultative organisms (s faecalis plus e cloacae)--did not result in a significant increase in abscess formation. combination of a facultative organism or organisms with the anaerobe b bivius or s faecalis plus b bivius plus e cloacae resulted in 55% (p < .01) and 74% (p < .0005) rates of abscess formation, respectively, as compared with controls. combinations including b fragilis demonstrated similar results. thus, female genital tract facultative organisms demonstrate synergy in the presence of anaerobic organisms in the development of abscesses.

TI  == distribution of free and liposome-encapsulated cefoxitin in experimental intra-abdominal sepsis in rats.
AB  == the distributions of radiolabelled free cefoxitin (fc) and liposome-encapsulated  cefoxitin (lc) were compared in an animal model of intra-abdominal sepsis. intraperitoneally administered lc was initially retained in the peritoneal cavity with subsequent preferential drug targeting to the liver (14% injected lc) and spleen (6% injected lc) by 3 h post-injection. differing patterns of liposomal drug and lipid retention indicated that drug release from the liposome complex occurred within the peritoneum, liver and spleen. intraperitoneal fc was rapidly  taken up into the systemic circulation, with peak recovery in the blood (9% injected fc) and liver (5% injected fc) at 1 h post-injection. fc was also rapidly eliminated; 7% of the injected drug was recovered in the kidney 1 h post-injection. a negligible amount of fc was recovered in the spleen and very little fc or lc was found in the lungs of treated animals. unlike fc, lc was found to provide a sustained bactericidal drug level (> 40 micrograms ml-1) in the peritoneal fluid for up to 5 h post-injection. lc also achieved significantly higher drug levels, compared with fc, within the liver at 3 and 5 h post-injection. since severe intra-abdominal sepsis is often characterized by the presence of intraphagocytic bacteria in hepatic and splenic reticuloendothelial systems, the enhanced delivery of liposome-encapsulated anti-microbial agents, such as cefoxitin, to the liver and spleen may provide a more effective treatment for the septic condition.

TI  == [a nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in japan (1988-1990)].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

TI  == ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam dilution tests with mixed cultures of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and enterococcus.
AB  == bacterial interactions in mixed infections may compromise antimicrobial therapy.  the in vitro bactericidal activity of ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam against aerobic/anaerobic mixed cultures of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. was studied by means of broth dilution tests. the mbc of ampicillin for enterococcus faecalis 6 was 0.25 mg/l when tested singly; in association with b. fragilis 1, however, the mbc for e. faecalis 6 was 16 mg/l. when tested singly e. coli 9 and b. fragilis 1 were both killed by ampicillin at  a concentration of 4 mg/l in combination with 1 mg/l sulbactam. when both strains were associated, the mbc for b. fragilis 1 rose to > 256 mg/l. results obtained indicate that the behaviour of bacteria as determined in pure cultures is not necessarily identical with the antibiotic susceptibility present in mixed cultures. it was shown that, besides beta-lactamase production by involved bacteria, other factors contribute to the alteration of bacterial susceptibility  in mixed cultures. synergistic and antagonistic effects between associated organisms were observed. for example, it was found that two moderately sensitive  bacterial strains were resistant in mixed culture.

TI  == effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  == an experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and  hyperbaric oxygen (hbo). the infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. the mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. the mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (ns). in the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001).  in experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of hbo to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, e-4497 [s(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7h-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of dr-3355 [s-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. e-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than dr-3355 and ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus  spp., and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of providencia spp., e-4497 inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. against enteric bacteria, e-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than dr-3355 and ciprofloxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics of e-4497, dr-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. against clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis, e-4497 (mics for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. e-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mm  mg2+. urine at ph 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at ph 7.2. however, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of e-4497. in general, e-4497 was bactericidal at the mic. in systemic infections with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of e-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of  dr-3355 and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == inactivation of metronidazole by enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == efficacy of sulbactam in an in vitro model of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections.
AB  == bacterial interactions in mixed infections may interfere with antimicrobial therapy. the in-vitro efficacy of ampicillin alone, combination sulbactam/ampicillin, and metronidazole was studied. strains of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, alone and in association,  were tested by means of a broth dilution method. minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of ampicillin for b. fragilis 74 in association with e. coli 68 were up to 16-fold higher than for b. fragilis 74 alone (256 compared to 16 mg/l), but only 2-fold higher for sulbactam (5 mg/l)/ampicillin (0.5 and 0.25 g/l). association of b. fragilis 45 and e. faecalis 186 increased ampicillin mbc  of e. faecalis 186 from 2 to 16 mg/l, but the combination sulbactam/ampicillin restored activity of ampicillin. in association with e. faecalis, metronidazole mbcs of b. fragilis increased up to 64-fold. strains of e. faecalis and e. coli were able to destroy 10 mg/l metronidazole within 8 to 20 h. the present experiments demonstrated effectiveness of sulbactam/ampicillin to inhibit beta-lactamases of associated pathogens. destruction of metronidazole by e. faecalis lends additional support to the use of the combination in aerobic/anaerobic infections including e. faecalis.

TI  == incidence and significance of intraperitoneal aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections frequently occur after trauma, surgical resections, or intrinsic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. these infections, which can be  generalized or localized in intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal locations as well  as in organs, are often difficult to diagnose and treat. they are usually polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the average number  of bacterial strains recovered is between two and five, with anaerobes dominating. the aerobic microorganisms most commonly recovered are enterobacteriaceae (mainly escherichia coli) and enterococci (mainly enterococcus faecalis). among the anaerobic microorganisms, bacteroides fragilis, anaerobic cocci, and clostridia are usually isolated. adequate surgical drainage and antimicrobial therapy improve the clinical course of intra-abdominal infections and reduce the risk of local complications and septicemia. the choice of antimicrobial agents should be based on the type of infection, the microorganisms most likely to be encountered, and the microbial sensitivity pattern of the clinic. the side-effect profile of the antimicrobial therapy should also be taken into consideration.

TI  == radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. i. development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (fmlp) is the major chemotactic  peptide in escherichia coli culture supernatants. this paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (ria) for fmlp and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. the assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/l fmlp) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with f-met-leu-tyr, f-nle-leu-phe and f-met-met-met sequences (id50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/l, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (id50 = 10(5) nmol/l. culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid  chromatography before ria. all five organisms produced immunoreactive f-met peptides. a major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic fmlp was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in streptococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis cultures. in e. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive fmlp increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth  reaching 31.2 nmol/l(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/ml (n = 6). these findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a ria for fmlp will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to qa-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. the mics of qa-241 for 90% of staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of qa-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. at the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, qa-241 inhibited 90% of haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii. qa-241 was moderately active (mic for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against s. marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. the antibacterial activity of qa-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. in systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of qa-241 was  generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and  ciprofloxacin. in urinary tract infections in mice with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa, qa-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. in pulmonary infections in mice with klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of qa-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.

TI  == enhancement of survival from murine polymicrobial peritonitis with increased abdominal abscess formation.
AB  == muramyl dipeptide (mdp), a purified synthetic immune adjuvant, has been shown to  increase murine intraabdominal abscess formation in a monomicrobial model using bacteroides fragilis. this effect required live bacteria and was abolished by appropriate antibiotics. a polymicrobial model of peritonitis and abdominal abscess formation using streptococcus fecalis, escherichia coli, and b. fragilis  was initially used to determine mortality rates at various concentrations and obtain an appropriate ld50. animals were then pretreated with mdp or its inert buffer and underwent intraperitoneal injection of the appropriate bacterial suspension. mortality and abdominal abscess formation were then assessed at 2 weeks after injection. there was a significant reduction in mortality (p less than 0.03) in mice treated with mdp compared to the controls. in surviving animals, there was also a significant increase in the number of animals forming abscesses (p less than 0.05) following treatment with mdp. this study has shown that nonspecific immune stimulation by mdp provided enhanced protection against a polymicrobial intraperitoneal challenge and paradoxically increased the formation of abdominal abscesses at the same time. this may be regarded as enhancement of the natural history of survival from peritonitis via bacterial containment through intraabdominal abscess formation, a manifestation of beneficial outcome in experimental peritonitis.

AB  == the pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens with or without streptococcus faecalis. mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. the presence of s. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. s. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.

TI  == association experiments with aerobic and anaerobic pathogens: a model of in-vitro susceptibility testing in mixed infections. activity of enoxacin, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  == in infections of polymicrobial etiology, it seems mandatory to combine an antibiotic with marginal activity against anaerobes with an anti-anaerobic drug,  e.g. metronidazole or clindamycin. we investigated the effect of associations of  anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic pathogens on mbcs of enoxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and combinations of enoxacin plus clindamycin or metronidazole. single testing, and associations of bacteroides fragilis with escherichia coli or enterococcus faecalis revealed mbcs of 64 mg/l for enoxacin. however, investigating metronidazole, mbcs for b. fragilis increased from 0.5-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l in association with e. coli. the combination of enoxacin with metronidazole restored mbcs of 0.5 and 1 mg/l for the b. fragilis strains. b. fragilis associated with e. faecalis showed mbcs of 2 to 64 mg/l for metronidazole, an increase of up to 64-fold. the enoxacin mbcs for e. coli in association with b. fragilis were up to eight-fold higher than for e. coli alone  (2 mg/l compared to 0.25 mg/l). association of e. coli with e. faecalis and b. fragilis showed a low to moderate increase for mbcs of e. coli when enoxacin was  tested alone or in combination with metronidazole or clindamycin. in contrast, mbcs for e. faecalis did not change significantly with any of the associations or combinations tested. it is evident that in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of  associations of pathogens can be modified by interactions between strains, and/or antimicrobials.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies were carried out on sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained  are summarized as follows: 1. a total of 248 clinical isolates were employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of sbt/abpc against various bacterial species. sbt/abpc showed stronger antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms than against gram-negative rods. 2. the peak serum level  of abpc was about twice as high as that of sbt, and serum levels of abpc and sbt  declined with time. both drugs showed almost the same trend of changes in concentrations. the half-lives of both drugs were about 1 hour. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 52-80% for abpc and 70-73%  for sbt. 4. the effect of sbt/abpc on coagulation system was examined. no case showed changes in pt, aptt, tt and hpt before and after administration of sbt/abpc. platelet aggregation during administration of sbt/abpc was slightly faster than that before administration, suggesting that sbt/abpc had no effect on platelet aggregation. generally speaking, it seemed that sbt/abpc was a safe antibiotic for bleeding. 5. the effect of sbt/abpc on the intestinal bacterial flora in experimental animals was examined. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve were reduced after administration of sbt/abpc, suggesting that the intestinal bacterial flora was affected by the administration of sbt/abpc more greatly than by the administration of abpc alone. in a similar investigation being made with clinical cases, both aerobes and anaerobes showed great changes. concentrations of the drugs in feces increased with increasing dosage, resulting in greater changes of  the intestinal bacterial flora. thus, the total number of aerobes and anaerobes was reduced. no diarrhea was observed in any subjects examined. from the above results, it appeared that sbt/abpc was a safe and useful antibiotic for various bacterial infections in the field of pediatrics.

TI  == [influence of sultamicillin on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == effects of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules, a new oral beta-lactam antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated  mice and in pediatric patients. sbtpc was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. in all of the 4 species, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced on days 4 to 5 after the start of the treatment. subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at ages from 1 year 3 months to 10 years 8 months and with their body weight ranging from 11.8 kg to 35.0 kg. sbtpc fine granule was administered at a  dose of 10 mg/kg 3 to 4 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although there were some variations in the fecal bacterial flora noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as enterobacteriaceae,  enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium decreased markedly in all cases. these decreases were more pronounced for anaerobes and total numbers of anaerobes were markedly reduced in all cases. glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase with administration of sbtpc fine granule. although these changes tended to return to pre-dosing state after the cessation of the treatment with sbtpc fine granule, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency when treatment with the drug is  continued for a long period of time. fecal concentrations of both ampicillin and  sulbactam during sbtpc fine granule treatment showed relatively high values except 1 sample with a high beta-lactamase activity in feces. these high concentrations suggest the possibility of biliary excretion of absorbed drugs and the possibility of hydrolysis of sbtpc in the intestine due to high ph. fecal concentrations of the drug also appeared to be closely related to beta-lactamase  activity in feces.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == norfloxacin binds to human fecal material.
AB  == earlier studies have reported very high (120 to 2,700 mg/kg) concentrations of norfloxacin in feces after therapeutic doses. mics for fecal microorganisms are with few exceptions far below these levels. nevertheless, clinical investigations show that the main part of the aerobic gram-positive and the anaerobic microflora remains unaffected after norfloxacin administration. in this study, the binding of [14c]norfloxacin to fecal material was analyzed. the binding of a group of nonlabeled quinolones to feces and the interactions between enterococcus faecium, bacteroides fragilis, and norfloxacin were also investigated. the results showed  that norfloxacin has the ability to bind to feces. the specific binding was reversible, saturated after 90 min of incubation at 37 degrees c, and increased linearly with fecal concentration. scatchard plots and nonlinear regression computer analyses revealed two different binding classes. the primary specific binding had a dissociation constant (kd) of 1.0 microm and a maximal binding capacity (bmax) of 0.12 mumol/g of feces. the kd and bmax of the secondary, more  unspecific binding were 450 microm and 11.8 mumol/g of feces, respectively. the binding of unlabeled ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin to feces was comparable to that of [14c]norfloxacin. the results of norfloxacin binding to suspensions of b. fragilis suggested that the main part of the binding is to the bacterial fraction of feces. in the presence of 8.0 g (dry  weight) of b. fragilis per liter, the mbc of norfloxacin for e. faecium increased from 8 to 256 micrograms/ml. the finding of the present study indicated that binding of norfloxacin to feces may explain the paradox of high fecal concentrations of norfloxacin versus the actual effect on the normal gastrointestinal microflora.

TI  == contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  == protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not  have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. thimerosal, iodoacetate, edta  and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by  bacteria in the large gut. these results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed  cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. extracellular proteases  were formed by streptococcus faecalis st6, propionibacterium acnes p6, clostridium perfringens c16, cl. bifermentans c21 and cl. sporogenes c25. inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. in many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of escherichia coli, and recently, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. the distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. results of our trials are summarized below: of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the  efficacy ratio of 89%. no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == cefotetan compared with gentamicin and tinidazole in acute abdominal surgery.
AB  == in a prospective randomised trial 190 consecutive admissions undergoing emergency abdominal surgery were allocated to receive a 24-h peri-operative prophylactic regime of either cefotetan or gentamicin and tinidazole. wound sepsis developed in 14 patients in each group and one patient in each group developed intra-abdominal abscess. nine patients in the cefotetan group and 10 patients in  the gentamicin and tinidazole group died within 1 month of surgery. the death of  one patient in each group was directly related to sepsis. sixty-five per cent of  aerobes isolated at operation were sensitive to cefotetan and 62% sensitive to gentamicin. the in vitro anaerobic cover of tinidazole was complete, whereas 13%  of anaerobes isolated at operation were resistant to cefotetan. anaerobes, predominantly bacteroides fragilis, were isolated from six of the 14 infected wounds following cefotetan prophylaxis and two of the 14 infected wounds in the gentamicin and tinidazole group. it is therefore recommended that cefotetan should be combined with a nitroimidazole in patients undergoing emergency colo-rectal procedures.

TI  == effect of bacterial products on prostaglandin e production by amnion cells.
AB  == an in-vitro model was set up to study a possible causal relation between bacterial colonisation of extraplacental membranes and spontaneous preterm labour. when amnion cells in tissue culture were exposed to bacterial products, their prostaglandin e output rose considerably. the degree of response varied with the organism. these findings support the theory that bacterial products may  be responsible for the premature onset of labour.

TI  == in-vitro activity of sch 34343 against nosocomial pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococci, gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied  in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. it was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and bacteroides fragilis. on the basis of these promising results, sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.

TI  == [cefminox concentration in tissues and clinical efficacy of cefminox in acute peritonitis].
AB  == cefminox sodium (cmnx, mt-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii, cmnx has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. for therapeutic purpose, cmnx was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g x  1) to 2 g (1 x 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). the clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. no adverse effect was observed. there were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 escherichia coli, some enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. these isolated organisms were eradicated after cmnx treatment, except a strain of e. faecalis was decreased. in 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, cmnx was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body  fluids samples were taken during the operation. cmnx concentration was determined to a bioassay with escherichia coli nihj or vibrio vercolans atcc 8461 as the test organisms. cmnx concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). cmnx concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. in the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, cmnx levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. therefore, cmnx sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.

TI  == bacterial synergism between the enterococcus and escherichia coli.
AB  == the pathogenicity of the enterococcus in surgical infections remains unclear. to  examine this issue, rats received an intravascular infusion of 10(9) enterococcus. no rats died. rats that received a sublethal inoculum of escherichia coli with 5 x 10(8) enterococcus had a 40% mortality (p less than 0.05). cutaneous infections in rabbits with e. coli, bacteroides fragilis, and enterococcus were examined singly and in combination. infections with e. coli measured 21 +/- 1 mm, with enterococcus were 15 +/- 1 mm, and with b. fragilis were 9 +/- 1 mm in diameter. when e. coli and enterococcus were combined together, significantly larger cutaneous infections were noted (p less than 0.05). no apparent synergism existed between the enterococcus and b. fragilis. these data indicate a synergistic relationship between the enterococcus and e. coli.

TI  == survival and detection of bacteroides spp., prospective indicator bacteria.
AB  == preliminary experiments were performed to assess the use of intestinal bacteroides spp. as indicators of fecal contamination of water. viable counts of  bacteroides fragilis, an anaerobic bacterium, declined more rapidly than those of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. however, a fluorescent antiserum prepared against b. fragilis successfully detected high proportions (18 to greater than 50%) of b. fragilis cells suspended for 8 days in aerobic water in dialysis bags at the ambient temperature. these percentages were higher than the  percent viable recoveries of the two indicator bacteria used for comparison. thus, the fluorescent antiserum test for b. fragilis might serve as a useful indicator of fecal contamination of water. an advantage of this approach over coliform analysis is the rapidity at which the test can be performed.

TI  == cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime: an example of advantageous antimicrobial metabolism.
AB  == although the antibacterial activity of desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx), the principal metabolite of cefotaxime (ctx), is eightfold lower than cefotaxime, the metabolite inhibits many b-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and unusual pseudomonas species resistant to agents such as cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefoperazone. des-ctx is more stable than ctx to attack by beta-lactamases of some species such as bacteroides fragilis, proteus vulgaris, and the k-1 enzyme of enterobacter-klebsiella. des-ctx acts synergistically with ctx against many enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity of the  combination of ctx/des-ctx indicates that the drug can be administered every 8-12 hr and provides excellent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

TI  == increase in immunoglobulin m antibodies against gut bacteria during acute hepatitis a.
AB  == the marked increase in the total serum immunoglobulin m (igm) is a characteristic feature of acute hepatitis a. to study the nature of this igm, we assayed serial  titers of igm antibodies against various antigens during and after acute hepatitis a. the antibodies against blood group antigen remained unchanged throughout the observation period. thus, the production or metabolism of igm was  not nonspecifically altered. the igm antibody against hepatitis a antigen decreased and finally disappeared during convalescence as expected. however, its  time course did not correlate quantitatively with the concentration of the total  serum igm. in contrast, igm antibodies against gut bacteria bacteroides fragilis  and streptococcus faecalis were considerably elevated in all patients at the onset of the disease, and they normalized similarly to the total igm during convalescence. igm antibodies against escherichia coli were elevated only in some of the patients. the data suggest that the amount of igm antibodies against gut bacteria contributes significantly to the increase in the total serum igm in acute hepatitis a.

TI  == phagocytosis and killing of bacteria in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  == phagocytosis and intracellular killing of several facultative anaerobes were observed in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the presence of anaerobes affected  these processes. bacteroides asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis were killed by phagocytes only at bacterial concentrations less than 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml; at higher concentrations of the anaerobes, killing of b. fragilis and concomitant facultative anaerobes was inhibited. this effect appeared to be due to an interaction, in appropriate reducing conditions, between anaerobe and serum, which allowed engulfment of organisms by phagocytes but markedly impaired intracellular killing.

AB  == sodium piperacillin t-1220, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was tested in vitro against 297 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and 669 aerobic bacteria by the conventional agar dilution method and compared with carbenicillin and ticarcillin. at a 100-mug/ml concentration the three drugs showed comparable effectiveness against the anaerobes tested. however, at 20 mug/ml, piperacillin was the most effective drug against bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococci, and  group d streptococci. at this drug concentration only 48% of the b. fragilis strains exhibited susceptibility to carbenicillin only, 64% exhibited susceptibility to ticarcillin but 90% exhibited susceptibility to piperacillin. similar findings were observed with peptostreptococci and group d streptococci. on a weight basis piperacillin was statistically shown to be the most effective antibiotic of the three tested against these anaerobes. at 20 mug/ml, piperacillin exhibited a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) over carbenicillin and ticarcillin for serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas isolates, and citrobacter  diversus. at both 20- and 100-mug/ml concentrations, piperacillin appeared to be  the most effective (calculated p < 0.01) upon klebsiella species, k. pneumoniae,  s. marcescens, and c. freundii in activity over ticarcillin and carbenicillin.

TI  == assessment of wound contamination by wound irrigation. experimental investigations on quantitative recovery of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.
AB  == the quantitative recovery of e. coli, s. faecalis and b. fragilis from operative  abdominal wounds was investigated in pigs in an experimental model suitable for statistical calculations. wounds were contaminated in groups of ten with different numbers of either a single bacterial species or a mixture of two species. the wound was irrigated with saline 20 minutes after contamination. significant differences in recovery were found between the bacterial species investigated. expressed as percentage of the number of bacteria used for contamination, the recovery for a given species was rather low, but it was constant and independent of the degree of contamination. the investigation did not suggest any principle difference in the recovery of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the clinical applicability of the method is not yet clarified.

TI  == anaerobes in human biliary tracts.
AB  == during a 2-year period, 1,892 patients underwent biliary tract surgery at the mayo clinic. both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bile were performed in 371 of these patients. sixty-nine percent of the cultures were positive, and 41% (117) of these grew anaerobes, although they were present in pure culture only twice. mixed cultures most commonly contained four different organisms (three aerobes and one anaerobe). bacteroides fragilis was the single most commonly isolated anaerobe and ranked fourth in terms of overall isolates behind escherichia coli,  group d streptococci, and klebsiella b. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total  group d streptococci, and klebsiella. b. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total aerobic and anaerobic isolates and was present in 21% of all positive cultures. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens ranked fifth and sixth, providing 6.5 and 5.9% of all isolates, respectively. this study demonstrates the frequent presence of anaerobes in patients with bactibilia and suggests that they be considered in the formulation of antimicrobial therapy for infections involving human biliary tracts.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in spontaneous peritonitis of cirrhosis: report of two cases and review of the literature.
AB  == the role of anaerobic or microaerophillic bacteria in spontaneous peritonitis of  cirrhosis has not been clearly defined. among 126 cases recorded in the literature, in only eight (6 per cent), including the two reported here, was bacterascites associated with anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria. clinical features in these cases were indistinguishable from those associated with aerobic bacteria. however, polymicrobial bacterascites occurred in four of eight cases associated with anaerobes, as contrasted with only 10 of 118 cases (8 per cent) associated with aerobes alone. on the other hand, concurrent bacteremia occurred  in only one of eight cases associated with anaerobes as contrasted with 52 of 118 cases (44 per cent) of aerobic spontaneous peritonitis. experimental evidence is  cited in an attempt to explain this relatively low incidence of spontaneous peritonitis associated with anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria, despite the high density of these organisms in the normal bowel flora.

TI  == microbial synergy in experimental intra-abdominal abscess.
AB  == intra-abdominal sepsis was studied in wistar rats by using four microbial species: escherichia coli, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium varium. these organisms were implanted into the peritoneal cavity singly and in all possible dual combinations. results were evaluated by mortality rates and the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses on autopsy following sacrifice after 7 days. mortality was restricted to recipients of e. coli, thus implicating coliforms in the acute lethality associated with this experimental model. intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in 61 of 95 (94%) animals that received the combination of an anaerobe and a facultative organism. abscesses failed to form with any single strain or with e. coli plus enterococci, and they were detected in one 1 of 19 animals receiving b. fragilis plus f. varium. these results suggest that intra-abdominal abscess formation is related to synergy between anaerobes and facultative bacteria.

TI  == factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
AB  == antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of bacteroides fragilis. comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of e. coli or b. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable b. fragilis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus albus, neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. the presence of dense cultures of b. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. other factors inhibiting conjugation  to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of b. fragilis in vivo. as well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of r factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.
