TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  == in order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (lab) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 lab strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (phleum pratense l.) and orchardgrass (dactylis glomerata l.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. according to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups,  including enterococcus gallinarum, lactobacillus acidipiscis, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, l. coryniformis subsp. torquens, l. curvatus, l. paraplantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. plantarum subsp. plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella hellenica, weissella paramesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens. this is the first report to document that c. divergens, l. acidipiscis, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. garvieae, phenotypically novel l. lactis subsp. cremoris, e. gallinarum and w. hellenica are present in vegetative  forage crops. l. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences  for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth ph and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. these results are useful in understanding the diversity of lab associated with decayed silage of timothy and  orchardgrass.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (o-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. for stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and atcc 19433), enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (atcc 25778), and enterococcus gallinarum (atcc 35038) produced extracellular o-2. among 106 strains comprising 13 species  of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular o-2. mean (+/-se) rates of extracellular o-2 production in vitro by e . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of o-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (p=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular o-2 production.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
