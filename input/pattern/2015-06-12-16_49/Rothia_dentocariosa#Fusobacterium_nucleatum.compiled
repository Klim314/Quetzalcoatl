TI  - Bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  - Current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. This study used 454-pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 region of 16S rRNA genes (approximately 500 bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. A total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. Plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. In addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. All of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. Pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per sample. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. Changes in the relative abundance of OTUs during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (BoP) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. Comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. Taxa associated with gingivitis included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Lachnospiraceae [G-2] sp. HOT100, Lautropia sp. HOTA94, and Prevotella oulorum, whilst Rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. Further study of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent periodontal disease.
TI  - Shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  - The shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. During a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). A higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. Rothia dentocariosa and Scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.
TI  - A study of the bacteria associated with advancing periodontitis in man.
AB  - Samples of apical plaque were taken by means of an anaerobic gas-flushed syringe  from 21 sites in eight patients. The samples were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated and incubated in an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2 for 7-21 days. All colonies on plates containing 20-50 isolates were picked, repeatedly restreaked, characterized and identified where possible by a probabilistic computer identification program. The sites were divided into four groups on the basis of clinical features. The significance of differences between bacterial populations in the groups was determined by the Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, while the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the rank correlation of clinical features of diseases and microbial species. The subgingival microbiota in advanced destructive sites was predominated by Gram-negative rods. The microbiota of two young adult patients with generalized extensive bone loss, extensive clinical inflammation and suppuration was dominated by Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and an organism with characteristics consistent with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The predominant cultivable microbiota in two patients with extensive bone loss but minimal clinical inflammation was predominated by Bacteroides melaninogenicus ss intermedius and Eikenella corrodens in one patient and E. corrodens and a slow growing fusiform-shaped Bacteroides in a second patient. A third group of four patients demonstrated moderate levels of clinical inflammation and evidence of continued bone loss in the last year. Predominant organisms in this group were more heterogeneous and included B. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, the "fusiform" Bacteroides and anaerobic vibrios. Sites with minimal disease in the patients revealed higher proportions of Gram-positive organisms including Rothia dentocariosa, Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus. A positive rank correlation could be detected between clinical inflammation including suppuration and B. asaccharolyticus and a negative rank correlation between inflammation and E. corrodens.
