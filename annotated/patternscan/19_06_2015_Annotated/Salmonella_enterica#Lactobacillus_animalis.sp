TI  == reduced burden of salmonella enterica in bovine subiliac lymph nodes associated with administration of a direct-fed microbial.
AB  == despite effective food safety interventions within abattoirs, salmonella enterica remains a common contaminant of raw ground beef. research has recently implicated peripheral lymph nodes (plns) as a potential route by which salmonella contaminates ground beef. this study examined the efficacy of using lactobacillus animalis (formerly designated lactobacillus acidophilus; np51) and propionibacterium freudenreichii (np24), at 109 cfu/head/day, as a direct-fed microbial (dfm) in feedlot cattle diets to control salmonella within plns. two studies were conducted in which cattle were randomly allocated into either control or dfm treatment groups. diets of treated cattle were supplemented with 109 cfu/head/day of the dfm, while control groups received no dfm supplementation. during slaughter at abattoirs, one subiliac lymph node (sln) per carcass was collected from 627 carcasses from one study and 99 carcasses from the second study. lymph nodes were cultured to estimate the presence and concentration of salmonella. in the first study, effects of dfm supplementation varied across slaughter days. on the first and second slaughter days, prevalence  was reduced by 50% (p = 0.0072) and 31% (p = 0.0093), respectively. no significant difference was observed on slaughter day three (p = 0.1766). in the second study, salmonella was 82% less likely (p = 0.008) to be recovered from slns of treatment cattle. while a greater relative risk reduction was observed in the latter study, absolute risk reductions were similar across studies. a significant reduction in the concentration of salmonella in slns (p < 0.0001) on  a cfu/g and cfu/node basis was also observed in cattle administered np51 and np24 in the first study; in the second study, too few quantifiable slns were observed  to facilitate meaningful comparisons. the results indicate that np51 and np24 supplementation may aid in reducing the prevalence and concentration of salmonella in slns and, therefore, serve as an effective control measure to reduce salmonella in ground beef products.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  == a defined bacterial culture protective against salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (cf) culture apparatus. chicks receiving the cf culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by s. typhimurium. the culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. the isolates were identified as enterococcus avium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis (designated a and b), lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus animalis, a lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain cms), citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, e. fergusonii, bifidobacterium animals, and propionibacterium acidipropionici. results indicated that cf cultures can be  used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to s. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
