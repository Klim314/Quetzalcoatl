TI  - Occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native Brazilian reservation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native Brazilians living at the Umutina Indian Reservation, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. METHODS: Periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence and risk analysis was performed using Cochran and Mantel-Haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or Pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. The interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, or P. gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. Patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by Porphyromonas gulae and P. intermedia or by the association between P. gulae and T. forsythia. P. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. Gingival bleeding was associated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, T. forsythia, P. gingivalis, P. gulae, Porphyromonas endodontalis, P. intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens. Treponema denticola was uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: Peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in native Brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as T. denticola, and the presence of P. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Proinflammatory Activity of Primarily Infected Endodontic Content against Macrophages after Different Phases of the Root Canal Therapy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the presence of target bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins in teeth with apical periodontitis. Levels of inflammatory mediators (interleukin [IL]-1beta and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) were determined after macrophage stimulation with endodontic content after different phases of endodontic therapy using different irrigants. METHODS: Thirty primarily infected root canals were randomly assigned into 3 groups according to the irrigant used for root canal preparation (n = 10 per group): GI: 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, GII: 2% chlorhexidine gel, and GIII (control group): saline solution. Root canal samples were taken by using paper points before (s1) and after root canal instrumentation (s2), subsequently to 17% EDTA (s3), after 30 days of intracanal medication (Ca[OH]2 + saline solution) (s4), and before root canal obturation (s5). Polymerase chain reaction (16S recombinant DNA) and limulus amebocyte lysate assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. Macrophages were stimulated with the root canal contents for IL-1beta/TNF-alpha measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Porphyromonas gingivalis (17/30), Porphyromonas endodontalis (15/30), and Prevotella nigrescens (11/30) were the most prevalent bacterial species. At s1, endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canals (median = 32.43 EU/mL). In parallel, substantial amounts of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were produced by endodontic content-stimulated macrophages. At s2, a significant reduction in endotoxin levels was observed in all groups, with GI presenting the greatest reduction (P < .05). After a root canal rinse with EDTA (s3), intracanal medication (s4), and before root canal obturation (s5), endotoxin levels reduced without differences between groups (P < .05). IL-1beta and TNF-alpha release decreased proportionally to the levels of residual endotoxin (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the use of sodium hypochlorite or CHX, the greatest endotoxin reduction occurs after chemomechanical preparation. Increasing steps of root canal therapy associated with intracanal medication enhances endotoxin reduction, leading to a progressively lower activation of proinflammatory cells such as macrophages.
TI  - Combinations of bacterial species associated with symptomatic endodontic infections in a Chinese population.
AB  - AIM: To use microarrays to detect 11 selected bacteria in infected root canals, revealing bacterial combinations that are associated with clinical symptoms and signs of primary endodontic infections in a Chinese population. METHODOLOGY: DNA was extracted from 90 samples collected from the root canals of teeth with primary endodontic infections in a Chinese population, and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were hybridized to microarrays containing specific oligonucleotide probes targeting 11 species, and the arrays were screened with a confocal laser scanner. Pearson's chi-squared test and cluster analysis were performed to investigate the associations between the bacterial combinations and clinical symptoms and signs using SAS 8.02. RESULTS: Seventy-seven samples (86%) yielded at least one of the 11 target species. Parvimonas micra (56%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (51%), Tannerella forsythia (48%), Prevotella intermedia (44%) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (37%) were the most prevalent taxa and were often concomitant. The following positive associations were found between the bacterial combinations and clinical features: P. endodontalis and T. forsythia with abscess; P. gingivalis and P. micra with sinus tract; P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis or P. micra and P. endodontalis with abscess and sinus tract; and the combination of P. endodontalis, P. micra, T. forsythia and P. gingivalis with sinus tract (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Various combinations of P. micra, P. endodontalis, T. forsythia and P. gingivalis may contribute to abscesses or sinus tracts of endodontic origin with bacterial synergism in a Chinese population.
TI  - Identification of Dipeptidyl-Peptidase (DPP)5 and DPP7 in Porphyromonas endodontalis, Distinct from Those in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) that liberate dipeptides from the N-terminal end of  oligopeptides are crucial for the growth of Porphyromonas species, anaerobic asaccharolytic gram negative rods that utilize amino acids as energy sources. Porphyromonas endodontalis is a causative agent of periapical lesions with acute symptoms and Asp/Glu-specific DPP11 has been solely characterized in this organism. In this study, we identified and characterized two P. endodontalis DPPs, DPP5 and DPP7. Cell-associated DPP activity toward Lys-Ala-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) was prominent in P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 as compared with the Porphyromonas gingivalis strains ATCC 33277, 16-1, HW24D1, ATCC 49417, W83, W50, and HNA99. The level of hydrolysis of Leu-Asp-MCA by DPP11, Gly-Pro-MCA by DPP4, and Met-Leu-MCA was also higher than in the P. gingivalis strains. MER236725 and MER278904 are P. endodontalis proteins belong to the S9- and S46-family peptidases, respectively. Recombinant MER236725 exhibited enzymatic properties including substrate specificity, and salt- and pH-dependence similar to P. gingivalis DPP5 belonging to the S9 family. However, the kcat/Km figure (194 microM-1.sec-1) for the most potent substrate (Lys-Ala-MCA) was 18.4-fold higher as compared to the P. gingivalis entity (10.5 microM-1.sec-1). In addition, P. endodontalis DPP5 mRNA and protein contents were increased several fold as compared with those in P. gingivalis. Recombinant MER278904 preferentially hydrolyzed Met-Leu-MCA and exhibited a substrate specificity similar to P. gingivalis DPP7 belonging to the S46 family. In accord with the deduced molecular mass of 818 amino acids, a 105-kDa band was immunologically detected, indicating that P. endodontalis DPP7 is an exceptionally large molecule in the DPP7/DPP11/S46 peptidase family. The enhancement of four DPP activities was conclusively demonstrated in P. endodontalis, and remarkable Lys-Ala-MCA-hydrolysis was achieved by qualitative and quantitative potentiation of the DPP5 molecule.
TI  - [Study of association between Parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of Parvimonas micra (Pm) and the associations  between Pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of Pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. The teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. Samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial DNA was undertaken. The Pm 16S rDNA level was evaluated using 16S rDNA PCR. The prevalence of Pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. Then, the associations of Pm and Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Porphyromonas endodontalis (Pe) as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were analysed. RESULTS: Pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. The prevalences of Pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, P < 0.05). Significant correlations (untreated group OR = 5.98, root-canal-treated group OR = 33.50) between Pm and Pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between Pm and Pg as well as Ef were not of significance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher relevance ratio of Pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. Pm and Pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.
TI  - Biologic activity of porphyromonas endodontalis complex lipids.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periapical infections secondary to pulpal necrosis are associated with bacterial contamination of the pulp. Porphyromonas endodontalis, a gram-negative organism, is considered to be a pulpal pathogen. P. gingivalis is phylogenetically related to P. endodontalis and synthesizes several classes of novel complex lipids that possess biological activity, including the capacity to promote osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. The purpose of this study was to extract and characterize constituent lipids of P. endodontalis and evaluate their capacity to promote proinflammatory secretory responses in the macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, as well as their capacity to promote osteoclastogenesis and inhibit osteoblast activity. METHODS: Constituent lipids of both organisms were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and were structurally characterized using electrospray mass spectrometry or electrospray-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The virulence potential of P. endodontalis lipids was then compared with known biologically active lipids isolated from P. gingivalis. RESULTS: P. endodontalis total lipids were shown to promote tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion from RAW 264.7 cells, and the serine lipid fraction appeared to account for the majority of this effect. P. endodontalis lipid preparations also increased osteoclast formation from RAW 264.7 cells, but osteoblast differentiation in culture was inhibited and appeared to be dependent on Toll-like receptor 2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These effects underscore the importance of P. endodontalis lipids in promoting inflammatory and bone cell activation processes that could lead to periapical pathology.
TI  - Effects of stress hormones on the production of volatile sulfur compounds by periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of halitosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of adrenaline (ADR), noradrenaline (NA) and cortisol (CORT) on bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), the major gases responsible for bad breath. Cultures of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas endodontalis (Pe), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were exposed to 50 microM ADR, NA and CORT or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and 24 h. Growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. Portable gas chromatography was used to measure VSC concentrations. Kruskal-Wallis and the Dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. For Fn, ADR, NA and CORT significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). All the substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production (p<0.05). For Pe, all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and NA significantly increased the H2S concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). In the Pg and Pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). In the Pi cultures, ADR, NA and CORT increased H2S (p<0.05). Catecholamines and cortisol can interfere with growth and H2S production of sub-gingival species in vitro. This process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress and the production of VSC.
TI  - An investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  - Different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the pulp chambers (PCs) and root canals (RCs) of infected primary teeth using PCR methods. Paired PC and RC samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by PCR for the presence of Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella tannerae, Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Treponema socranskii. The frequency of each species was determined in the PC and RC of each case. The species most frequently detected in PCs were P. nigrescens (86.7%), P. gingivalis (73.3%), and F. alocis (73.3%). Of the PC samples, 13.3% contained P. micra and T. denticola, and 6.7% contained T. forsythia. The species most frequently detected in RCs were P. gingivalis (100%) and P. nigrescens (93.3%). P. tannerae, P. micra, and T. denticola were found in 40% of the RC samples; T. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the RC samples. The "red complex", which comprises P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia, was not found in the PC of any tooth but was found in 30% of the RC samples. The detection of P. nigrescens in the PC was statistically associated with the presence of P. nigrescens in the RC (p = 0.04). The results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.
TI  - Molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - The human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. This study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. An in-depth 16S rRNA gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. A complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. This included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found in all samples regardless of age and health status. Yet, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected in children. In contrast, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. Obligate anaerobes like Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of Porphyromonas and Prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Tannerella forsythia. Unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus intermedius and Prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were scarce. The findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. The study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.
TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - Detection of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella  intermedia in primary endodontic infections in a Chinese population.
AB  - AIM: To assess the prevalence of three black-pigmented bacterial species (Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) using microarray technology in root canals of teeth associated with primary endodontic infections in a Chinese population. METHODOLOGY: Microbial samples were taken from root canals of 80 teeth with pulp necrosis and primary endodontic infections in a Chinese population. DNA extracted from the samples was amplified by PCR with universal bacterial primers based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and the products hybridized with the microarrays in which the specific oligonucleotide probes were added. The results of hybridization were screened by a confocal laser scanner. Pearson chi-square test and the two-sided Fisher exact test were used to analyse whether a significant association existed between the species and symptoms as well as in co-existence of two target organisms by a statistical software package (SAS 8.02). RESULTS: The 16S rRNA gene microarray detected at least one of the three test species in 76% of the study teeth. P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were found in 50%, 33% and 45%, respectively. A significant association was found in the presence of the pair P. endodontalis / P. gingivalis (P < 0.005). Both P. endodontalis (P <0.05) and P. gingivalis (P <0.005) had a statistically significant association with the presence of a sinus tract. The simultaneous presence of P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis was also associated with the presence of a sinus tract (P<0.005) and abscess formation (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The three black-pigmented bacteria were prevalent in teeth with pulp necrosis and primary endodontic infections in a Chinese population. P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis were associated with the presence of sinus tract and abscess formation.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (RC) system and apical tissues. Data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as RC with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (AAA), are scarce in the literature. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic RC and AAA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. METHODS: Paired samples of RC and AAA exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by PCR for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. The frequency of species was compared between the RC and the AAA samples. A stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. A dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. RESULTS: All samples harbored bacterial DNA. Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Filifactor alocis, and Tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both RC and AAA samples. The selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia. The samples of RC and AAA that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of RC and AAA.
TI  - Porphyromonas endodontalis in chronic periodontitis: a clinical and microbiological cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have shown the presence of Porphyromonas endodontalis in chronic periodontitis associated with periapical lesions, the occurrence of this pathogen in diseased periodontal sites without periapical lesions has been poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to quantify P. endodontalis in patients with chronic periodontitis without periapical lesions, to evaluate the potential correlation of P. endodontalis with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, and to evaluate the ability of periodontal treatment to reduce these pathogens. DESIGN: Patients with generalized chronic periodontitis were selected by recording clinical attachment level (CAL), probing depth (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP). Subgingival samples from 30 diseased nonadjacent sites (CAL>/=5 mm, PD between 5 and 7 mm and positive BOP) and 30 healthy nonadjacent sites (PD</=3 mm and negative BOP) were collected and subjected to microbial analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) The variables of age, PD, CAL and BOP of all individuals were analyzed using the paired t-test (GrapPad Prism5((R))). Data of bacteria quantification were subjected to a normality test (D'Agostino-Pearson Test). For bacterial correlation analysis, the Spearman correlation was used. RESULTS: Our results showed that diseased sites had significantly higher levels of P. endodontalis compared to healthy sites, similar to the results obtained for P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. The numbers of all bacterial species were reduced significantly after mechanical periodontal treatment. P. endodontalis was significantly correlated with the presence of T. forsythia and P. gingivalis in the diseased group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis and T. forsythia in periodontitis sites and that mechanical periodontal treatment is effective at reducing the pathogens studied.
TI  - Predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. This study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six Labrador retrievers. The samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. From the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. Each of the strains was characterized by Gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic growth and API-ZYM test. Eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on DNA sequencing technology. Cross-reactions of DNA probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. RESULTS: Thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. They represented 21 different species, of which six belonged to the genus Porphyromonas. No species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. Porphyromonas crevioricanis and Fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. DNA probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. CONCLUSION: The predominant cultural subgingival flora in dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.
TI  - Asp- and Glu-specific novel dipeptidyl peptidase 11 of Porphyromonas gingivalis ensures utilization of proteinaceous energy sources.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis, asaccharolytic black-pigmented anaerobes, are predominant pathogens of human chronic and periapical periodontitis, respectively. They incorporate di- and tripeptides from the environment as carbon and energy sources. In the present study we cloned a novel dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) gene of P. endodontalis ATCC 35406, designated as DPP11. The DPP11 gene encoded 717 amino acids with a molecular mass of 81,090 Da and was present as a 75-kDa form with an N terminus of Asp(22). A homology search revealed the presence of a P. gingivalis orthologue, PGN0607, that has been categorized as an isoform of authentic DPP7. P. gingivalis DPP11 was exclusively cell-associated as a truncated 60-kDa form, and the gene ablation retarded cell growth. DPP11 specifically removed dipeptides from oligopeptides with the penultimate N-terminal Asp and Glu and has a P2-position preference to hydrophobic residues. Optimum pH was 7.0, and the k(cat)/K(m) value was higher for Asp than Glu. Those activities were lost by substitution of Ser(652) in P. endodontalis and Ser(655) in P. gingivalis DPP11 to Ala, and they were consistently decreased with increasing NaCl concentration. Arg(670) is a unique amino acid completely conserved in all DPP11 members distributed in the genera Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides, whereas this residue is converted to Gly in all authentic DPP7 members. Substitution analysis suggested that Arg(670) interacts with an acidic residue of the substrate. Considered to preferentially utilize acidic amino acids, DPP11 ensures efficient degradation of oligopeptide substrates in these Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
TI  - Electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on Titanium Grade 2 and Ti6Al4V alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  The aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure Grade 2 Ti and Ti Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. Ti Grade 2 and Ti Grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130V for pure titanium; 100 and 120V for Ti6Al4V alloy. Surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS probe, laser profilometry and X-ray diffractometry. Bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. Osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. The higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130V) and Ti6Al4V alloy (120V) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and Ti6Al4V and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. The observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.
TI  - Characterization of the Porphyromonas gingivalis conjugative transposon CTnPg1: determination of the integration site and the genes essential for conjugal transfer.
AB  - In our previous study, extensive genomic rearrangements were found in two strains of the Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas (Por.) gingivalis, and most of these rearrangements were associated with mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences and conjugative transposons (CTns). CTnPg1, identified in Por. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277, was the first complete CTn reported for the genus Porphyromonas. In the present study, we found that CTnPg1 can be transferred from strain ATCC 33277 to another Por. gingivalis strain, W83, at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6). The excision of CTnPg1 from the chromosome in a donor cell depends on an integrase (Int; PGN_0094) encoded in CTnPg1, whereas CTnPg1 excision is independent of PGN_0084 (a DNA topoisomerase I homologue; Exc) encoded within CTnPg1 and recA (PGN_1057) on the donor chromosome. Intriguingly, however, the transfer of CTnPg1 between Por. gingivalis strains requires RecA function in the recipient. Sequencing analysis of CTnPg1-integrated sites on the chromosomes of transconjugants revealed that the consensus attachment (att) sequence is a 13 bp sequence, TTTTCNNNNAAAA. We further report that CTnPg1 is able to transfer to two other bacterial species, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella oralis. In addition, CTnPg1-like CTns are located in the genomes of other oral anaerobic bacteria, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella buccae and Prevotella intermedia, with the same consensus att sequence. These results suggest that CTns in the CTnPg1 family are widely distributed among oral anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria found in humans and play important roles in horizontal gene transfer among these bacteria.
TI  - Detection and clonal analysis of anaerobic bacteria associated to endodontic-periodontal lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial agents in root canal systems can induce periodontal inflammation. The aims of this study are to detect anaerobic microorganisms in endodontic-periodontal lesions, determine the genetic diversity among them, and assess the simultaneous colonization of the pulp and periodontal microenvironments by a single clone. METHODS: Twenty-seven teeth of patients with endodontic-periodontal lesions were selected. Samples were spread on an agar-blood medium, the detection of each species was performed using a polymerase chain reaction, and the determination of the simultaneous presence of the same species in the microenvironments by one or more clones was determined using arbitrarily primed PCR. RESULTS: Prevotella intermedia (Pi) was the most prevalent species of the colonies in periodontal pockets, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Pi were the more prevalent in root canals. Isolates of Pi and Pg were simultaneously identified in root canals and periodontal pockets. Eighteen percent of teeth exhibited the simultaneous colonization by Pg, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Porphyromonas endodontalis in the pulp and periodontal microenvironments. The presence of these species was noted even in niches from which no colonies were isolated. Seventeen different genotypes were found in periodontal and pulp sites, with the majority of sites colonized by one or two different genotypes. A high degree of genotype similarity was found for samples of Pg isolated from only one site as well as for those isolated from both microenvironments. CONCLUSION: Different clones of Pi and Pg with a high intraspecific genotype similarity were found to colonize the same anatomic sites in endodontic-periodontal infections.
TI  - Viral-bacterial associations in acute apical abscesses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Viral-bacterial and bacterial synergism have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases. This study sought to investigate the possible associations between 9 candidate endodontic bacterial pathogens and 9 human viruses in samples from acute apical abscesses. STUDY DESIGN: DNA extracts from purulent exudate aspirates of 33 cases of acute apical abscess were surveyed for the presence of 9 selected bacterial species using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. Single or nested PCR assays were used for detection of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpesviruses types 1 to 8. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the abscess samples were positive for at least one of the target viruses. Specifically, the most frequently detected viruses were HHV-8 (54.5%); HPV (9%); and varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and HHV-6 (6%). Bacterial DNA was present in all cases and the most prevalent bacterial species were Treponema denticola (70%), Tannerella forsythia (67%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (67%), Dialister invisus (61%), and Dialister pneumosintes (57.5%). HHV-8 was positively associated with 7 of the target bacterial species and HPV with 4, but all these associations were weak. Several bacterial pairs showed a moderate positive association. Viral coinfection was found in 6 abscess cases, but no significant viral association could be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated that bacterial and viral DNA occurred concomitantly in two-thirds of the samples from endodontic abscesses. Although this may suggest a role for viruses in the etiology of apical abscesses, the possibility also exists that the presence of viruses in abscess samples is merely a consequence of the bacterially induced disease process. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of these viral-bacterial interactions, if any, in the pathogenesis of acute apical abscesses.
TI  - Antigenicity of primary endodontic infection against macrophages by the levels of PGE(2) production.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Root canal contents are potent stimuli for proinflammatory cytokines involved in apical periodontitis. This study investigated target gram-negative bacterial species and endotoxins in primary endodontic infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of PGE(2), and evaluated their relationship with clinical findings. METHODS: Samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary infection and apical periodontitis by using paper points. Polymerase chain reaction (16S rDNA) was used for bacterial detection and limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement. Levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Duoset Kit; R&D, Minneapolis, MN). RESULTS: Prevotella nigrescens (13/21), Fusobacterium nucleatum (6/21), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (6/21) were the most frequently observed species. A positive association was found between F. nucleatum and P. endodontalis (P < .05). A correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins, such as PGE(2) (P < .05). Higher levels of endotoxin were detected in teeth with exudation, whereas elevated levels of PGE(2) were found in teeth with tenderness to percussion and pain on palpation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply an additive effect between the number of gram-negative bacterial species involved in endodontic infection regarding the induction of proinflammatory cytokine by macrophage cells. Moreover, teeth with clinical symptomatology were related to higher levels of endotoxins and PGE(2) secretion.
TI  - Identification of dominant pathogens in periapical lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to identify dominant pathogens in the periapical lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis. METHODS: thirty-three root-filled teeth with persistent apical periodontitis referred for surgical treatment were selected. Microbial samples were collected from the periapical lesions during apical surgery. Microbial identification was performed with species-specific primers prepared according to the sequence analysis data using a 16S rRNA technique. RESULTS: among the 33 cases, in 5 cases none of the target species were detected, 6 cases showed the presence of only one species, and 22 cases showed more than two species. Porphyromonas endodontalis (45% of sample) was the most commonly detected dominant microbial species in the study sample, followed by Actinomyces viscosus (42%), Candida albicans (36%) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (27%). Fusobacterium, Actinomyces israelii and Enterococcus faecalis were also detected in 27%, 21% and 15% of the sample, respectively. The most frequently isolated species, P. endodontalis, was in most cases detected together with Actinomyces (14 cases) and P. gingivalis (6 cases). None of the lesions analysed in the present study contained Prevotella intermedia. There was no correlation in relation to the presence of sinus tracts and the bacterial species. CONCLUSION: a mixed population of pathogens was found in the endodontic lesions associated with persistent apical periodontitis. P. endodontalis, A. viscosus, C. albicans and P. gingivalis were the dominant species identified.
TI  - Surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. STUDY DESIGN: Endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. During the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. The resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. The patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. RESULTS: The samples yielded 1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (Porphynomonas endodontalis and Prevotella oralis). Mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. At the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. Endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.
TI  - Sonic extracts from a bacterium related to periapical disease activate gelatinase A and inactivate tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.
AB  - AIM: To examine the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (SBEs) from three related to periapical disease bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum) on the activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) and the inactivation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). METHODOLOGY: Each SBE was added to cultures of human periodontal ligament (PL) cells or HT1080 cells and their supernatants were analysed by zymography for MMP-2. Each SBE was added to PL cell cultures, and the amount of TIMP-1 was determined by ELISA. P. gingivalis SBE was incubated with HT1080 cell culture supernatants, and the amounts of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were determined by ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed with the paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: In extracts of PL cells that had been incubated in the presence of P. gingivalis SBE, one representing pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) and a band corresponding to the active MMP-2 (66 kDa) were observed; but in the other extracts it was not detected. When HT1080 cells were treated with P. gingivalis SBE, the pro-MMPs was processed into 86- and 66-kDa fragments, but in the other extracts, the processing did not occur when the other SBEs were used. When PL cells were incubated with the same SBEs, the amount of TIMP-1 was markedly decreased (P < 0.01), but in the other extracts, it was not. The amounts of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner when HT1080 cell culture supernatant was incubated with P. gingivalis SBE. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that P. gingivalis SBE may cause connective tissue to be destroyed, contributing to the process of periapical disease, by activating pro-MMP-2 as well as by inactivating TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis and their roles in systematic diseases: true or false?
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial activity of [10]-gingerol and [12]-gingerol isolated from ginger rhizome against periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used widely as a food spice and an herbal medicine. In particular, its gingerol-related components have been reported to possess antimicrobial and antifungal properties, as well as several pharmaceutical properties. However, the effective ginger constituents that inhibit the growth of oral bacteria associated with periodontitis in the human oral cavity have not been elucidated. This study revealed that the ethanol and n-hexane extracts of ginger exhibited antibacterial activities against three anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53978, Porphyromonas endodontalis ATCC 35406 and Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, causing periodontal diseases. Thereafter, five ginger constituents were isolated by a preparative high-performance liquid chromatographic method from the active silica-gel column chromatography fractions, elucidated their structures by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and their antibacterial activity evaluated. In conclusion, two highly alkylated gingerols, [10]-gingerol and [12]-gingerol effectively inhibited the growth of these oral pathogens at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6-30 microg/mL. These ginger compounds also killed the oral pathogens at a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) range of 4-20 microg/mL, but not the other ginger compounds 5-acetoxy-[6]-gingerol, 3,5-diacetoxy-[6]-gingerdiol and galanolactone.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. DNA was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. A PCR assay using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by Peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. Moreover, PCR detected Filifactor alocis in 26.7%, Treponema denticola in 24.4%, and Tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. T. denticola and P. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). P. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). P. endodontalis and P. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). Synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. The results of this study indicated that E. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by PCR in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. However, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) origins is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. To minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. METHODS: GeneScan-1000 ROX was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (MW) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16S recombinant RNA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of the conventional method. Microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new MW size definition. Bacterial species were assigned to peaks using TRFMA, a Web-based tool for T-RFLP analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. RESULTS: Using the new size definition, the average sizing error for 40 T-RFs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. More than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by T-RFLP. CONCLUSION: The size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the T-RFLP analysis. This provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens in chronic endodontic infection.
AB  - Black-pigmented anaerobic rods such as Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp. are involved in the etiology and perpetuation of endodontic infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these species in chronic endodontic infections by using culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Samples of 100 patients with root canals displaying chronic endodontic infections were obtained by sterilized paper points. Bacterial identification was performed by using culture and PCR techniques. By culture, in 33% of the samples, P. intermedia-P. nigrescens (75.8%), P. gingivalis (27.3%), and P. endodontalis (9.1%) were identified, and by PCR 60% of the samples harbored P. nigrescens (43.3%), P. gingivalis (43.3%), P. intermedia (31.7%), and P. endodontalis (23.3%). The presence of these black-pigmented anaerobic rods alone or in association in chronic endodontic infections seems to be frequent. PCR is a very sensitive technique for detecting DNA from bacterial cells. Culturing is only able to reveal living bacteria and is less sensitive for the identification of low numbers of bacterial cells.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. Nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the Ribosomal Database Project II database. Phylotypes from 37 genera representing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were identified. Results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. Since members of the domain Archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16S archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. A Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. DNA from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. Trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. Conversely, Porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. All other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. These results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. METHODS: Single-species biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on agar medium. The biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. Sterile saline was used as control. After each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 mL of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). The micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. Aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. Colony-forming units were calculated. The samples were compared using the Friedman and Tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for S. aureus with 2.5% NaOCl. Antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. Saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (P < 0.05) from NaOCl and chlorhexidine. P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by Ca(OH)2 mixed with sterile water and by CHX gel alone. Two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. However, 2% CHX gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. A paste of Ca(OH)2 plus sterile water inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. In conclusion, 2% CHX gel + Ca(OH)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than Ca(OH)2 manipulated with sterile water.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. Strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for 5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 J/cm2. Methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of E. faecalis (53% killing). The same concentration of methylene blue in combination with red light (222 J/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of E. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. We conclude that PDT may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to calcium hydroxide combined with different vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. For such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. Pastes were prepared with Ca(OH)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (CMCP), CMCP + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and CMCP + polyethyleneglycol. The time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the Kruskal Wallis test at 5% significance level. Timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. Microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). In conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. These findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.
TI  - Multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of Porphyromonas endodontalis, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, P. nigrescens, and P. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Two different multiplex PCR protocols were used (one for the two Porphyromonas species and the other for the three Prevotella species), each one using a primer pair specific for each target species. The results were compared to those of the conventional culture procedures. Microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. Samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a Rapid ID 32 A kit. Multiplex PCR was processed using the DNA extracted from each sample. At least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (BPB) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex PCR, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. Multiplex PCR was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting BPB than the conventional culture procedures.
TI  - NF-kappaB activation in human dental pulp stem cells by TNF and LPS.
AB  - Post-natal human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) represent a unique precursor population in the dental pulp, which has multipotential and can regenerate a dentin/pulp-like structure. Because the dental pulp is frequently infected by oral bacteria due to dental decay, in this study, we examined whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activated the immunologic transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in DPSCs. We found that both TNF and LPS activated the I-kappa B kinase complex (IKK) in DPSCs to induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Consistently, both TNF and LPS rapidly induced the expression of the NF-kappaB-dependent gene interleukin-8 (IL-8). However, unlike in monocytes, we found that LPS could not induce the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB active subunit p65 in DPSCs. In summary, our studies suggest that DPSCs may be involved in immune responses during pulpal infection through activating NF-kappaB.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by PCR.
AB  - he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. For PCR detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region. Culture and PCR detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. The organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. PCR detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. P. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by PCR (38%). Similarly, P. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by PCR in 25% of the sampled teeth. PCR-based identification also showed higher detection rates of P. intermedia (33%) and P. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). In conclusion, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. intermedia, and P. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. Also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by PCR than by culture.
TI  - 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus Porphyromonas.
AB  - The 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of 11 reference strains of Porphyromonas species, together with Bacteroides distasonis and Tannerella forsythensis, were analysed to examine interspecies relationships. Compared with the phylogenetic tree generated using 16S rRNA gene sequences, the resolution of the ITS sequence-based tree was higher, but species positioning and clustering were similar with both approaches. The recent separation of Porphyromonas gulae and Porphyromonas gingivalis into distinct species was confirmed by the ITS data. In addition, analysis of the ITS sequences of 24 clinical isolates of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica plus the type strain ATCC 25260(T) divided the sequences into two clusters, of which one was alpha-fucosidase-positive (like the type strain) while the other was alpha-fucosidase-negative. The latter resembled the previously studied unusual extra-oral isolates of 'Porphyromonas endodontalis-like organisms' (PELOs) which could therefore be called 'Porphyromonas asaccharolytica-like organisms' (PALOs), based on the genetic identification. Moreover, the proposal of alpha-fucosidase-negative P. asaccharolytica strains as a new species should also be considered.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis by loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  - A method for nucleic acid amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was employed to develop a rapid and simple detection system for periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. A set of six primers was designed by targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. By the detection system, target DNA was amplified and visualized on agarose gel within 30 min under isothermal condition at 64 degrees C with a detection limit of 20 cells of P. gingivalis. Without gel electrophoresis, the LAMP amplicon was directly visualized in the reaction tube by addition of SYBR Green I for a naked-eye inspection. The LAMP reaction was also assessed by white turbidity of magnesium pyrophosphate (a by-product of LAMP) in the tube. Detection limits of these naked-eye inspections were 20 cells and 200 cells, respectively. Although false-positive DNA amplification was observed from more than 10(7) cells of Porphyromonas endodontalis, no amplification was observed in other five related oral pathogens. Further, quantitative detection of P. gingivalis was accomplished by a real-time monitoring of the LAMP reaction using SYBR Green I with linearity over a range of 10(2)-10(6) cells. The real-time LAMP was then applied to clinical samples of dental plaque and demonstrated almost identical results to the conventional real-time PCR with an advantage of rapidity. These findings indicate the potential usefulness of LAMP for detecting and quantifying P. gingivalis, especially in its rapidity and simplicity.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  - Bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. The apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. The results showed that Pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), Treponema denticola in 6 (26%), Fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), Porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), Filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), Dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), Porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and Tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%). No sample yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, or Campylobacter rectus. Of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. Occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.
TI  - Induction of vascular endothelial growth factor expression in human pulp fibroblasts stimulated with black-pigmented Bacteroides.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of black-pigmented Bacteroides on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene in human pulp fibroblasts. METHODOLOGY: The supernatants of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were used to evaluate VEGF gene expression in human pulp fibroblasts. The levels of mRNAs were measured by the quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Black-pigmented Bacteroides induced significantly high levels of VEGF mRNA gene expression in human pulp fibroblasts (P < 0.05). In addition, the expression of VEGF depended on the bacteria tested. CONCLUSIONS: Black-pigmented Bacteroides may be involved in developing pulpal disease through the stimulation of VEGF production that would lead to the expansion of the vascular network coincident to progression of the inflammation.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of one- and two-visit endodontic treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis: a randomized, clinical trial.
AB  - The antimicrobial efficacy of endodontic procedures performed in one-visit (including a 10-min intraappointment dressing with 5% iodine-potassium-iodide) was compared with a two-visit procedure (including an interappointment dressing with calcium-hydroxide paste). Teeth with apical periodontitis (n = 96) were randomly assigned to either group. Root canal sampling and culturing were performed before and immediately after instrumentation, and after medication. Initial sampling demonstrated the presence of microorganisms in 98% of the teeth. Postinstrumentation sampling showed reduction of cultivable microbiota. Antibacterial dressing further reduced the number of teeth with surviving microbes. In the postmedication samples, residual microorganisms were recovered in 29% of the one-visit teeth and in 36% of the two-visit treated teeth. No statistically significant differences between the groups were discerned. It was concluded that from a microbiological point of view, treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis performed in two appointments was not more effective than the investigated one-visit procedure.
TI  - Geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. The purpose of this study was to use PCR to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. Microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in Portland, Oregon, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. PCRs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene were used for detection of the bacteria after DNA extraction from each clinical sample. Statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella tannerae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Enterococcus faecalis. These results suggest that differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX gel and CHX liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). A broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and statistically analyzed. Both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed Enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. All tested irrigants eliminated Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. The timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% CHX liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% NaOCl. The antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.
TI  - Induction of interleukin-8 gene expression by black-pigmented Bacteroides in human pulp fibroblasts and osteoblasts.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of black-pigmented Bacteroides on the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 gene in human pulp fibroblasts and osteoblasts. METHODOLOGY: The supernatants of Porphyromonas endodontalis, P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were used to evaluate IL-8 gene expression in human pulp fibroblasts and osteoblasts. The levels of mRNAs were measured by the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Investigations of the time-dependence of IL-8 mRNA expression in black-pigmented Bacteroides-treated pulp fibroblasts and osteoblasts revealed a rapid accumulation of the transcript after 2 h of exposure, and remained elevated throughout the 24-h incubation period. In addition, IL-8 mRNA gene expression was also found in human osteoblasts stimulated with black-pigmented Bacteroides. However, black-pigmented Bacteroides was found to be more effective in the induction of IL-8 mRNA gene expression in osteoblasts than in pulp fibroblasts (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Black-pigmented Bacteroides are capable of amplifying the local immune response and promoting pulpal/periapical tissue inflammation by stimulating pulp fibroblasts and osteoblasts to express IL-8.
TI  - Production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. We previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase IV (DAPIV) from P. gingivalis. In the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) capable of inhibiting the DAPIV activity of P. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant DAPIV as an immunogen. The constructed MAb, designated as MAb-Pg-DAP-1, significantly inhibited DAPIV activity in P. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus. Furthermore, the MAb did not inhibit DAPIV enzyme activity in human serum. This novel MAb may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.
TI  - The subgingival microflora in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from a PHT-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and PCR methods. RESULTS: The predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. The test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate Gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. Black-pigmented obligate anaerobic Gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. The black-pigmented rods were predominantly Prevotella intermedia in the test group and Prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly P. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.
TI  - Positive and negative bacterial associations involving Dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  - Dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic Gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. In this study, samples taken from abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving D. pneumosintes. DNA was extracted from the samples, and the presence of D. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. Positive and negative associations involving D. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of D. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. The association between the pairs containing D. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. D. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the other target species. D. pneumosintes was positively associated with Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, T. pectinovorum, and T. vincentii. Negative associations were observed with Bacteroides forsythus, P. gingivalis, and Actinomyces israelii. No pair containing D. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). The findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of D. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen, usually in a mixed infection. Positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as T. denticola and P. endodontalis, suggest that bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.
TI  - PCR methodology as a valuable tool for identification of endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews the principles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  methodology, its application in identification of endodontic pathogens and the perspectives regarding the knowledge to be reached with the use of this highly sensitive, specific and accurate methodology as a microbial identification test. DATA SOURCES: Studies published in the medical, dental and biological literature. STUDY SELECTION: Evaluation of published epidemiological studies examining the endodontic microbiota through PCR methodology. CONCLUSIONS: PCR technology has enabled the detection of bacterial species that are difficult or even impossible to culture as well as cultivable bacterial strains showing a phenotypically divergent or convergent behaviour. Moreover, PCR is more rapid, much more sensitive, and more accurate when compared with culture. Its use in endodontics to investigate the microbiota associated with infected root canals has expanded the knowledge on the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases. For instance, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), Treponema denticola, other Treponema species, Dialister pneumosintes, and Prevotella tannerae were detected in infected root canals for the first time and in high prevalence when using PCR analysis. The diversity of endodontic microbiota has been demonstrated by studies using PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the PCR products. Moreover, other fastidious bacterial species, such as Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and some Eubacterium spp., have been reported in endodontic infections at a higher prevalence than those reported by culture procedures.
TI  - Induction of interleukin-6 gene expression by pro-inflammatory cytokines and black-pigmented Bacteroides in human pulp cell cultures.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines and black-pigmented  Bacteroides on the expression of IL-6 gene in human pulp fibroblasts. METHODOLOGY: IL-1alpha, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the supernatants of Porphyromonas endodontalis, P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were used to evaluate IL-6 gene expression in human pulp fibroblasts. The levels of mRNAs were measured by the quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Investigations of the time dependence of IL-6 mRNA expression in pro-inflammatory cytokines-treated cells revealed a rapid accumulation of the transcript after 2 h of exposure and remained elevated throughout the 24-h incubation period. In addition, black-pigmented Bacteroides also induced IL-6 gene expression in human pulp fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-inflammatory cytokines and black-pigmented Bacteroides may be involved in developing pulpal inflammation through the stimulation of IL-6 production.
TI  - Effect of black-pigmented bacteria on the plasminogen-plasmin system in human pulp and osteoblastic cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, there have been relatively few studies addressing the presence and expression of the plasminogen-plasmin system at the site of bacterial infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of black-pigmented bacteria on the expression of the plasminogen-plasmin system in human pulp and osteoblastic cells. STUDY DESIGN: The supernatants of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia were used to evaluate tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) gene expression in human pulp and osteoblastic cells. The levels of mRNA were quantitatively measured by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In this study, black-pigmented bacteria induced not only t-PA but also PAI-1 gene expression in human pulp and osteoblastic cells. In addition, the ratio of t-PA to PAI-1 was higher in human pulp and osteoblastic cells stimulated by black-pigmented bacteria than in untreated cell cultures (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: A fine balance exists in the expression of components of the plasminogen-plasmin system, whereby tissue homeostasis is maintained. Black-pigmented bacteria activate the activator-inhibitor system in human pulp and osteoblastic cells through unbalance regulation of t-PA and PAI-1, which might result in an uncontrolled degradation of pulpal and periapical tissues.
TI  - Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and protein expression in human pulp cells stimulated with black-pigmented bacteroides.
AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is induced after the activation of cells by a variety of proinflammatory agents. Recently, evidence has shown that COX-2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of pulpal inflammation. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of pulpal inflammation at the site of bacterial infection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the supernatants from black-pigmented Bacteroides (Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia) on the COX-2 expression in primary human pulp cells in vitro. Investigations of the time dependence of COX-2 mRNA expression in black-pigmented Bacteroides-treated human pulp cells revealed a rapid accumulation of the transcript, a significant signal first detectable after 1 h of exposure. In addition, black-pigmented Bacteroides also up-regulated COX-2 protein expression in human pulp cells. Data from our in vitro experiment showed that black-pigmented Bacteroides were capable of stimulating COX-2 expression in human pulp cells. These results indicate that black-pigmented Bacteroides species may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulpal inflammation. The activation of COX-2 may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of microbial-induced pulpal/periapical inflammation.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of resinous retrograde root filling materials.
AB  - The effect of three resinous retrograde root filling materials on the growth of four obligate anaerobic bacteria associated with endodontic infections was determined by using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. Samples of the following resinous materials (resin-modified, glass-ionomer cement, Fuji II LC; compomer, Dyract; and composite resin, Spectrum) were incubated for 1 week with the following anaerobic bacteria: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, and Prevotella intermedia. The freshly mixed and set resinous materials were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms for 1 week. After the end of the incubation period, the zone of growth inhibition was observed and measured. Analysis of variance of the mean diameter of the zone of inhibition indicated no statistically significant overall differences in the response of the black-pigmented Bacteroides species (p > 0.05). For F. nucleatum, Spectrum had more antibacterial effect against this bacteria than Dyract (p < 0.05). Additionally, Fuji II LC was ineffective against F. nucleatum (p < 0.05). However, positive control plates showed bacterial growth in all cases. Our data suggest that the antibacterial potency of polymerized materials varied considerably, depending on the type and the product tested.
TI  - Microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. Stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. The test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. Enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic Porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedial intermedia. Ca(OH)2 + CMCP + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. We conclude that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of 16S rDNA-based PCR and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation for detection of selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  - Molecular methods have been used recently to investigate the bacteria encountered in human endodontic infections. The aim of the present study was to compare the ability of a 16S rDNA-based PCR assay and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation in detecting Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Por. gingivalis and Treponema denticola directly from clinical samples. Specimens were obtained from 50 cases of endodontic infections and the presence of the target species was investigated by whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation or taxon-specific oligonucleotides with PCR assay. Prevalence of the target species was based on data obtained by each method. The sensitivity and specificity of each molecular method was compared with the data generated by the other method as the reference--a value of 1.0 representing total agreement with the chosen standard. The methods were also compared with regard to the prevalence values for each target species. Regardless of the detection method used, T. denticola, Por. gingivalis, Por. endodontalis and B. forsythus were the most prevalent species. If the checkerboard data for these four species were used as the reference, PCR detection sensitivities ranged from 0.53 to 1.0, and specificities from 0.5 to 0.88, depending on the target bacterial species. When PCR data for the same species were used as the reference, the detection sensitivities for the checkerboard method ranged from 0.17 to 0.73, and specificities from 0.75 to 1.0. Accuracy values ranged from 0.6 to 0.74. On the whole, matching results between the two molecular methods ranged from 60% to 97.5%, depending on the target species. The major discrepancies between the methods comprised a number of PCR-positive but checkerboard-negative results. Significantly higher prevalence figures for Por. endodontalis and T. denticola were observed after PCR assessment. There was no further significant difference between the methods with regard to detection of the other target species.
TI  - PCR-based identification of bacteria associated with endodontic infections.
AB  - PCR primers that target the bacterial 16S rRNA genes (or the tuf gene for the genus Enterococcus) were used to identify 10 putative bacterial pathogens in root canals with necrotic pulp. In addition, the associations of these microorganisms with symptoms and a history of diabetes mellitus were investigated. Microbial samples from the root canals of 24 teeth with necrotic pulp were included in the study. PCR with universal bacterial primers identified bacterial DNA in 22 specimens; the remaining 2 specimens were from intact teeth that had been traumatized 6 months prior to treatment. PCR with specific primers showed that preoperative symptoms were significantly associated with the presence of Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001 by chi-square analysis). There was also a nonsignificant trend for symptoms to be associated with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis (odds ratio, >2) and for diabetes mellitus to be associated with P. gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis (odds ratio, >2). Cloning and sequencing of the universal PCR product in one specimen revealed the presence of an organism related to the genus Olsenella, which has not previously been described in endodontic infections.
TI  - Microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  - The microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases, associated with hematological disorders'. Examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (DQB1) and serotypes (DR locus) of HLA class II antigens. Phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted. The subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by Gram-negative rods, especially Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by Gram-positive cocci and Gram-positive rods. Through the use of polymerase chain reaction, Campylobacter rectus and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. intermedia, and Treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. All three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. Each subject had the same genotype, HLA-DQB1*0601, while the mother had HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR8, and the son and daughter had HLA-DR2 only. In summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. It is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.
TI  - Comparison of temporal changes in components of formalin guaiacol under several storage conditions.
AB  - This study examined the effects of storage conditions such as time course, temperature, fluorescent light, and darkness on the components and antibacterial activity of formalin guaiacol (FG) used in endodontic treatment. We measured the quantities of formaldehyde and guaiacol in FG and antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. The components and antibacterial activity of FG in the brown or transparent tightly sealed containers were not affected by temperature or fluorescent light throughout the 4 week test. However, in the loosely sealed containers, formaldehyde and guaiacol in FG sample decreased remarkably within one week, not only in a temperature- and time-dependent manner, but also under fluorescent light at 20 degrees C. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities in the FG sample were significantly attenuated in parallel with the decrease in formaldehyde levels. Fluorescent light caused color changes and crystallization of FG samples in the transparent containers. These results suggest that it is important to replace fresh FG every 5 to 7 days for endodontic treatment and that, in the dental office, it is advisable to store fresh FG in tightly sealed containers every 2 weeks to maintain its efficacy.
TI  - Invasion of vascular cells in vitro by Porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  - AIM: The objective of this study was to determine whether laboratory strains and  clinical isolates of microorganisms associated with root canal infections can invade primary cultures of cardiovascular cells. METHODOLOGY: Quantitative levels of bacterial invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) were measured using a standard antibiotic protection assay. Transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm and visualize internalization within the vascular cells. RESULTS: Of the laboratory and clinical strains tested, only P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 was invasive in an antibiotic protection assay using HCAEC and CASMC. Invasion of P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. DISCUSSION: Certain microorganisms associated with endodontic infections are invasive. If bacterial invasion of the vasculature contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, then microorganisms in the pulp chamber represent potential pathogens.
TI  - Quantitative microbiological study of human carious dentine by culture and real-time PCR: association of anaerobes with histopathological changes in chronic pulpitis.
AB  - The bacteria found in carious dentine were correlated with the tissue response of the dental pulps of 65 teeth extracted from patients with advanced caries and pulpitis. Standardized homogenates of carious dentine were plated onto selective and nonselective media under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. In addition, real-time PCR was used to quantify the recovery of anaerobic bacteria. Primers and fluorogenic probes were designed to detect the total anaerobic microbial load, the genera Prevotella and Fusobacterium, and the species Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Micromonas (formerly Peptostreptococcus) micros. The pulpal pathology was categorized according to the cellular response and degenerative changes. Analysis of cultured bacteria showed a predominance of gram-positive microorganisms, particularly lactobacilli. Gram-negative bacteria were also present in significant numbers with Prevotella spp., the most numerous anaerobic group cultured. Real-time PCR analysis indicated a greater microbial load than that determined by colony counting. The total number of anaerobes detected was 41-fold greater by real-time PCR than by colony counting, while the numbers of Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp. detected were 82- and 2.4-fold greater by real-time PCR than by colony counting, respectively. Real-time PCR also identified M. micros, P. endodontalis, and P. gingivalis in 71, 60, and 52% of carious samples, respectively. Correlation matrices of the real-time PCR data revealed significant positive associations between M. micros and P. endodontalis detection and inflammatory degeneration of pulpal tissues. These anaerobes have been strongly implicated in endodontic infections that occur as sequelae to carious pulpitis. Accordingly, the data suggest that the presence of high levels of these bacteria in carious lesions may be indicative of irreversible pulpal pathology.
TI  - Stimulation of matrix metalloproteinases by black-pigmented Bacteroides in human  pulp and periodontal ligament cell cultures.
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading most components of the extracellular matrix. Recently, evidence has shown that MMPs may play a role in tissue degradation in inflamed dental pulp. To date very little is known regarding the mechanism of extracellular matrix destruction at the site of bacterial infection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the supernatants from Porphyromonas endodontalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the production and secretion of MMPs by primary human pulp and periodontal ligament (PDL) cell cultures in vitro. The results were evaluated by substrate gel zymography from long-term cultures. The main gelatinase secreted by human pulp and PDL cells migrated at 72 kDa and represented MMP-2. Minor gelatinolytic bands were also observed at 92 kDa regions that correspond to MMP-9. After an 8-day culture period, P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis were found to elevate MMP-2 production both in human pulp and PDL cell cultures. In addition, the stimulation was in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Both human pulp and PDL cells, however, treated with either P. endodontalis or P. gingivalis had no effect on the pattern of MMP-9 produced or secreted in either cell extracts or conditioned medium fractions. These results indicate that black-pigmented Bacteroides species play an important role in tissue destruction and disintegration of extracellular matrix in pulpal and periapical diseases. Thus, activation of MMPs may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of microbial-induced pulpal and periapical lesion. An understanding of the actions of these black-pigmented Bacteroides species on pulp and PDL cells may result in new therapies to augment current treatment of pulpal and periapical lesions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (AH26, AH plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (N2), and one calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealapex). The testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia). The freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. After varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. All the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial activity. The sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types and bacterial strains. N2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. The extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  - Past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Single Bond, Prime&Bond NT, and Excite were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus intermedius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella oris, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Clostridium ramosum with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Prime&Bond NT showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to Single Bond, whereas EX produced no inhibitory effect on Porphyromonas endodontalis, although the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to Streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. The variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.
TI  - Molecular detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  - A 16S rDNA-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods in root canal infections. Samples were obtained from 54 infected teeth. Ten cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based identification assay. The method allowed detection of black-pigmented bacteria anaerobes in 59.3% of the examined teeth. Twelve cases yielded more than one black-pigmented species. In general Porphyromonas endodontalis was found in 42.6%, Porphyromonas gingivalis in 27.8%, Prevotella nigrescens in 7.4%, and Prevotella intermedia in 5.6% of the cases. P. endodontalis was found in 70% of the pus samples, P. gingivalis in 40%, and P. intermedia in 10%. P. gingivalis was always found associated with P. endodontalis in abscessed teeth. P. nigrescens was not found in any pus sample. The high prevalence of P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases.
TI  - Detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16S rDNA-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A 16S rDNA-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, Treponema denticola, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. Pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin. DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based identification assay. The method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. Porphyromonas endodontalis was found in 70%, T. denticola in 50%, Porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and Prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. P. gingivalis was always found associated with P. endodontalis. Prevotella nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. The high prevalence of P. endodontalis, T. denticola, and P. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - Anaerobic bacterial extracts influence production of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by human dental pulp cells.
AB  - The role of human dental pulp (HDP) cells in extracellular matrix degradation in  pulpitis is still unclear. In this study, the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (SBEs) from Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis on the balance between the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and that of their inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)] by HDP cells were examined. HDP cells were treated with SBEs, and their culture media were later harvested. MMP activities and TIMP concentrations were determined by use of independent measurement strategies and sensitive ELISAs. The production of MMP-1 and MMP-2 was accelerated by all SBE. On the other hand, TIMP-1 production was slightly elevated; and TIMP-2 production was markedly inhibited by all of the extracts. SBEs derived from these anaerobic bacteria seemed to affect the acceleration of extracellular matrix degradation activity by HDP cells. These findings suggest that HDP cells stimulated by bacterial byproducts may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.
TI  - Whole genomic DNA probe for detection of Porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to develop a DNA probe for Porphyromonas endodontalis. Pure cultures of P. endodontalis were grown in TYP medium, in an anaerobic chamber. DNA was extracted from the P. endodontalis and labeled using the Genius System by Boehringer Mannheim. The labeled P. endodontalis DNA was used in dot-blot hybridization reactions with homologous (P. endodontalis) and unrelated bacterial samples. To determine specificity, strains of 40 other oral bacterial species (e.g. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, and Prevotella intermedia) were spotted and reacted with the P. endodontalis DNA probe. None of the panel of 40 oral bacteria hybridized with the P. endodontalis probe, whereas the blot of the homologous organism showed a strong positive reaction. To determine the sensitivity of the probe, dilutions of a P. endodontalis suspension of known concentration were blotted onto a nylon membrane and reacted with the probe. The results of our investigation indicate that the DNA probe that we have prepared specifically detects only P. endodontalis and can detect at least 3 x 10(4) cells.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Phospholipid analogues of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas has lipids containing hydroxy acids and C16:0 and iso-C15:0 major monocarboxylic acids among others. Nothing is known of its individual phospholipid molecular species. The aim of this study was to determine molecular weights and putative identities of individual phospholipid molecular species extracted from Porphyromonas gingivalis (seven strains), P. asaccharolytica (one strain) and P. endodontalis (two strains). Cultures on Blood-Fastidious Anaerobe Agar were harvested, washed and freeze-dried. Phospholipids were extracted and separated by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB MS) in negative-ion mode. Phospholipid classes were also separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The major anions in the range m/z 209-299 were consistent with the presence of the C13: 0, C15: 0, C16: 0 and C18: 3 mono-carboxylate anions. Major polar lipid anion peaks in the range m/z 618-961 were consistent with the presence of molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and with unidentified lipid analogues. Porphyromonas gingivalis differed from comparison strains of other species by having major anions with m/z 932, 946 and 960. Unusually, a feline strain of P. gingivalis had a major peak of m/z 736. Selected anions were studied by tandem FAB MS which revealed that peaks with m/z 653 and 946 did not correspond to commonly occurring classes of polar lipids. They were however, glycerophosphates. It is concluded that the polar lipid analogue profiles obtained with Porphyromonas are quite different from those of the genera Prevotella and Bacteroides but reveal heterogeneity within P. gingivalis.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide from endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  - We examined the induction of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 by lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from several species of possible endodontopathic black-pigmented bacteria. Studies were conducted in human whole blood cultures from six patients (two from each group) with differing numbers of periapical periodontitis lesions (i.e. patients with radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high-lesion group, n = 4), in one or two teeth (low-lesion group, n = 6), and six healthy volunteers with no periapical lesions (no lesion group)). LPS from Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, and Prophyromonas endodontalis ATCC 27067 induced a higher IL-8 response in the subjects of the high-lesion group, compared with the subjects of the other two groups. To ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the subjects to different bacterial species. LPS from P. gingivalis reacted strongly with sera from the high-lesion group. Thus, LPS from black-pigmented bacteria may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing particular cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Survey for collagenase gene prtC in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis isolated from endodontic infections.
AB  - Collagenase is a potential virulence factor shown to be expressed by Porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease. The purpose of this study was to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the collagenase gene (prtC) in 21 strains of Porphyromonas species isolated from endodontic infections. Type strains for P. gingivalis (ATCC 33277), P. endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25611), and Prevotella nigrescens (ATCC 33563) were used as controls. When PCR primers specific for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of P. gingivalis or P. endodontalis were used, 16 of the strains were identified as P. gingivalis, and five strains were identified as P. endodontalis. The presence of the prtC gene for collagenase was detected using PCR. Amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with an 815 bp amplicon representing the presence of the collagenase gene. Type strain ATCC 33277 and all 16 clinical isolates of P. gingivalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. Neither type strain ATCC 35406 nor the five strains from clinical isolates of P. endodontalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. These results indicate that P. gingivalis from endodontic infections possesses the prtC gene. P. endodontalis does not seem to exhibit prtC. The virulence of P. gingivalis may be related to its production of collagenase.
TI  - Black-pigmented anaerobic rods in closed periapical lesions.
AB  - AIM: This study determined the frequency of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in 20 closed periapical lesions associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic refractory endodontic disease. METHODOLOGY: To deliniate possible oral sources of P. endodontalis, the presence of the organism was assessed in selected subgingival sites and saliva in the same study patients. Periapical samples were obtained by paper points during surgical endodontic procedures using methods designed to minimize contamination by non-endodontic microorganisms. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained by paper points from three periodontal pockets and from the pocket of the tooth associated with the closed periapical lesion. Unstimulated saliva was collected from the surface of the soft palate. Bacterial identification was performed using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection method. RESULTS: P. endodontalis was not identified in any periapical lesion, even though subgingival samples from eight patients (40%) revealed the P. endodontalis-specific amplicon. P. gingivalis occurred in one periapical lesion that was associated with moderate pain. P. nigrescens, P. endodontalis and P. intermedia were not detected in any periapical lesion studied. CONCLUSIONS: Black-pigmented anaerobic rods appear to be infrequent inhabitants of the closed periapical lesion.
TI  - Ecology of genus Porphyromonas in canine periodontal disease.
AB  - Asaccharolytic pigmented Porphyromonas species, including P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis, P. circumdentaria and unclassified species, were isolated from the plaque of adult dogs, but not from any oral sites of puppies and adolescent dogs. With age-dependency, the proportion of Porphyromonas species in the flora of plaque increased. Isolation of the genus Porphyromonas was clearly associated with the progress of periodontol disease. We suggested that Porphyromonas is the exogenous organism and obligate pathogen for canine periodontal diseases.
TI  - Cytotoxic effect of endodontic bacteria on periapical fibroblasts.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (SBEs) from anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria on periapical fibroblast obtained from the apical portion of human periodontal ligaments. Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were chosen from among the endodontic bacteria isolated from root canals having a periapical lesion and compared in terms of their cytotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to examine which bacteria are involved in the development of periapical inflammation. The anaerobes were cultured under strict anaerobic conditions, and the bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation after incubation. The concentrated cell suspensions were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged. An SBE was made of each of the filtered supernatants. Each SBE was added to cultures of periapical fibroblasts. The cell growth and proliferation were measured by the MTT method after 3, 5, and 7 days. The SBEs from P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum inhibited the growth of the fibroblasts, whereas the SBE from P. intermedia did not inhibit it. The SBEs from P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum inhibited the fibroblast growth more strongly than did the P. endodontalis, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum may participate in the development of periapical lesions.
TI  - Recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: medical aspects.
AB  - There is still inadequate information on the role of certain newly described or reclassified anaerobes in disease processes, on their normal sites of carriage, and on their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Herein, we summarize this information (most of the literature reviewed is from the past 5 years, but a few of the articles are approximately 10 years old). Porphyromonas species had seemed to be relatively nonpathogenic, but recent work indicates that this belief is incorrect. P. gingivalis, P levii-like organisms, and P. endodontalis-like organisms have been recovered from a variety of oral and extraoral infections. P. macacae has been recovered from infected cat bite wounds. Sutterella wadsworthensis, recently differentiated from Campylobacter gracilis, has been found in a variety of infections. Bilophila wadsworthia has also been recovered from a wide variety of infections. Newly described anaerobic cocci, gram-positive nonsporeforming rods, and clostridia have also been isolated from various infections.
TI  - Phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of Porphyromonas and Prevotella species.
AB  - Species of Prevotella (Pr.) and Porphyromonas (Po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 J cm(-2)). Fluences of 35 to 80 J cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in Po. endodontalis, Po. gingivalis, Pr. denticola, Pr. intermedia, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. nigrescens. A fluence of 70 J cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of Bacillus, Candida, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin content of the cells. Overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of Prevotella or Porphyromonas.
TI  - Immunological characterization and localization of a Porphyromonas gingivalis BApNA-hydrolyzing protease possessing hemagglutinating activity.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (mAb-PC) was produced against a BA pNA-hydrolyzing protease possessing hemagglutinating activity (Pase-C) from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Other P. gingivalis BA pNA-hydrolyzing enzymes (Pase-B and Pase-S) did not react with this antibody. By ELISA or SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting analysis, mAb-PC recognized all P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis strains tested but did not recognize other members of the Porphyromonas genus nor other putative periodontopathogenic organisms. Pase-C, extracellular vesicles (ECV) and human strains of P. gingivalis showed two major immunoreactive bands (44 kDa and 40 kDa), whereas a different pattern was obtained with animal strains of P. gingivalis. Biotinylarginyl chloromethane, an irreversible inhibitor of trypsin-like proteases, did not affect the reactivity of Pase-C with mAb-PC on immunoblot. By reversed-phase electronmicroscopy following immunogold labeling, the antibody was shown to bind to the cell surface of P. gingivalis. mAb-PC inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of both P. gingivalis cells and ECV whereas a monoclonal antibody against LPS of P. gingivalis did not. These results suggest that Pase-C is located on the cell surface of P. gingivalis and may participate in erythrocyte binding.
TI  - Update on the taxonomy and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods.
AB  - Pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods are currently categorized as 17 species distributed in three genera: Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Bacteroides. These organisms are often encountered in clinical specimens but are also found as part of the indigenous flora on various mucosal surfaces. Several studies are presently assessing the association of individual species with health and disease. For example, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis are key putative pathogens in adult periodontitis and root canal infections, respectively. Porphyromonas asaccharolytica is prevalent in extraoral infections. The Porphyromonas species of animal origin have been isolated from infected bite wounds in humans. Isolates closely resembling Bacteroides levii have been recovered from various types of human infections. According to preliminary reports, Prevotella intermedia tends to be associated more often with periodontal disease than with a healthy oral cavity. In the laboratory, enzyme profiling facilitates the identification of these pigmented rods. Beta-Lactamase production is more common among prevotella species (30%-50%) than among Porphyromonas species (< 10%).
TI  - Sensitivity of Porphyromonas and Prevotella species in liquid media to argon laser.
AB  - The phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation was studied in aqueous suspensions of Porphyromonas endodontalis (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 35406), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), Prevotella denticola (ATCC 33184) and two strains of Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 15033 and 49046), all "black-pigmented bacteria," BPB, that accumulate cellular porphyrins. Several of these species have been implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. Non-black-pigmented bacteria were also studied to test the specificity of irradiation as a potential photodynamic treatment for periodontal infections. Cell suspensions were irradiated with an argon laser at fluences of 20-200 J/cm2. When cultured in hemin-supplemented media, ATCC 15033 was the most sensitive to irradiation. However, a second strain of the same species (ATCC 49046) was resistant. The photosensitivity of other species ranked ATCC 33277 > 35406 = 33184 = 35496. When hemin was replaced in media by hemoglobin, ATCC 33277 became resistant to irradiation. Protoporphyrin IX content in BPB cells was shown not to be a major factor determining photosensitivity. Oxygen was required during irradiation for BPB species to be affected. Non-black-pigmented bacteria were much less sensitive to irradiation than BPB.
TI  - Effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  - Human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the DNA content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. LPS samples were purified from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and Escherichia coli 0111:B4 LPS was used as a positive control. At a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the LPSs caused any change in the production of DNA or protein, whereas the amount of DNA was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. Protein synthesis was decreased by LPSs at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. Alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of LPS tested.
TI  - Oligonucleotide probes to the 16S ribosomal RNA: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens.
AB  - Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
TI  - Congo red binding by Porphyromonas gingivalis is mediated by a 66 kDa outer-membrane protein.
AB  - Congo red was bound from solution by strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis including W50, HG189, HG184, NCTC 11834, Bg 381, WPH35, the slower brown pigmenting colonial variant W50/BR1, and the avirulent mutant W50/BE1, and by Porphyromonas endodontalis HG370 and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica B537. SDS-PAGE of whole cells of all species examined displayed a 66 kDa Congo-red-binding component which was also detected in the outer membranes of P. gingivalis W50 grown in the chemostat under both haemin limitation and haemin excess, and which corresponded to a Coomassie-blue-stained band of the same mobility. Pretreatment of haemin-excess batch-grown cells of P. gingivalis W50 with polymyxin B, which binds to lipid A, did not inhibit binding, whilst binding was enhanced in the presence of 2 M ammonium sulphate, suggesting the involvement of non-specific hydrophobic interactions. Binding was also reduced by pretreatment with trypsin and papain, and by 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulphonic acid, which binds to hydrophobic amino acids. The 66 kDa binding component was sensitive to proteinase K digestion, and loss of Congo red staining of this band correlated with the quantitative reduction in Congo red binding by whole cells. These data, and our previous work, show that Congo red and iron protoporphyrin IX (haemin) are bound to different outer-membrane components, and that Congo red binding may be of little value as a marker to detect virulent strains of P. gingivalis or those expressing haemin-binding proteins.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the nahA gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis indicates that beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase is an outer-membrane-associated lipoprotein.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in human periodontal diseases. It expresses a number of exoglycosidase enzymes capable of hydrolysing host proteoglycan residues. As a first stage to explore the role of these enzymes in periodontal tissue damage, the nahA gene of P. gingivalis W83, which encodes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (beta-Nahase), was cloned. The gene was expressed poorly in Escherichia coli, but increased expression was achieved by cloning the nahA gene downstream of the tac promoter. Southern blot analysis revealed that nahA was present as a single copy, and it was found in all the other P. gingivalis strains tested. In contrast, sequences homologous to nahA were not detected in either P. endodontalis or P. asaccharolytica. The nahA gene was 2331 bp long and encoded a beta-Nahase enzyme of 777 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kDa. A characteristic signal peptide for an acylated lipoprotein was present at the amino-terminus, suggesting that the mature beta-Nahase is a lipoprotein. The predicted amino acid sequence of the P. gingivalis beta-Nahase shared homology with the catalytic domains of the human beta-Nahase enzyme and the chitinase of Vibrio harveyi, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism.
TI  - Degradation of immunoglobulin G by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a substrate for growth. This was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with IgG. Stimulation of growth was observed for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella oralis, Lactobacillus catenaforme and Streptococcus intermedius. Immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that P. intermedia and P. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of IgG. Partial breakdown of IgG was observed for P. asaccharolytica and C. ochracea, whereas P. oralis cleaved the IgG heavy chain, yielding Fc and Fab fragments. All these bacteria utilized IgG as a substrate for growth. Binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific IgG with P. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with P. intermedia, P. gingivalis, C. ochracea or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Degradation or inactivation of IgG by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivicanis sp. nov. and Porphyromonas crevioricanis sp. nov., isolated from beagles.
AB  - Two new species, Porphyromonas gingivicanis and Porphyromonas crevioricanis, are  proposed for black-pigmented, asaccharolytic, anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organisms. These organisms were isolated from the gingival crevicular fluids of beagles. P. gingivicanis and P. crevioricanis do not grow in the presence of 20% bile. They exhibit less than 5% DNA-DNA homology with the type strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis (strain ATCC 33277), Porphyromonas endodontalis (strain ATCC 35406), and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (strain ATCC 25260), which were isolated from humans, or with the type strains of Porphyromonas salivosa (strain NCTC 11632) and Porphyromonas circumdentaria (strain NCTC 12469), which were isolated from cats. The major cellular fatty acid of P. gingivicanis and P. crevioricanis is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-C15:0 acid). Glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present in both species, and 6-phosphogluconate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases are absent; neither organism exhibits trypsin activity. P. gingivicanis and P. crevioricanis produce large amounts of acetic and isovaleric acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and succinic acids as end products of metabolism in GAM medium. P. gingivicanis also produces large amounts of butyric acid and small amounts of propionic acid, while P. crevioricanis produces large amounts of propionic acid and minor amounts of butyric and phenylacetic acids. The G+C contents of the DNA of P. gingivicanis is 41 to 42 mol%; the G+C content of the DNA of P. crevioricanis is 44 to 45 mol%. Catalase is produced by P. gingivicanis but not by P. crevioricanis; strains of P. crevioricanis agglutinate sheep erythrocytes, but strains of P. gingivicanis do not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Immunobiological activities of a 55-kilodalton cell surface protein of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611.
AB  - A protein was extracted from whole cells of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 with sodium lauroylsarcosine and purified by chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow column. The The apparent molecular weight of the protein was 55,000. A mouse polyclonal antibody specific for the protein recognized the cell surface structure of P. intermedia and also reacted with proteins in lysates of other black-pigmented anaerobic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella melaninogenica, but not with those in lysates of Porphyromonas gingivalis or with the purified fimbriae of P. gingivalis 381. The N-terminal sequence of the 55-kDa protein showed only low homology with the cell surface proteins of any black-pigmented bacteria reported to date. The level of immunoglobulin G antibody to the antigen was higher in the sera of patients with periodontitis than in the sera of healthy volunteers. The protein induced interleukin-1 alpha, -1 beta, -6, and -8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and interleukin-1 beta and -6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures. The protein induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha activities in peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ as well as from C3H/HeN mice and also induced cytokine activities in the sera of both strains of mice primed with muramyldipeptide.
TI  - Direct detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis in Macaca fascicularis dental plaque samples using an oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - Oligonucleotide probes complementary to the hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and previously shown to specifically identify human P. gingivalis strains to the species level, were tested for their ability to recognize P. gingivalis from nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis), either as distinct isolates or in subgingival dental plaque. The 32P-labeled probes hybridized with all 147 monkey isolates identified as P. gingivalis by morphology and biochemistry, but did not hybridize with any of the 331 isolates representing 17 genera of bacteria unrelated to P. gingivalis, or to the more closely related P. endodontalis and P. asaccharolytica. This corresponds to sensitivities and specificities of 100%. Of 76 M. fascicularis plaque samples, P. gingivalis was detected by probe and culture in 67. Of 26 human plaque samples taken from separate individuals free of periodontal disease, 23 failed to demonstrate P. gingivalis by probe or culture. The results of the combined 102 monkey and human plaque samples indicate that, when compared to culture as the "gold standard," the P. gingivalis probe had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 87%, and an overall agreement with culture of 93%. These results reveal that the oligonucleotide probes used to identify P. gingivalis are specific for this organism, and give results comparable to culture methods for detecting the presence of P. gingivalis in M. fascicularis dental plaque.
TI  - Porphyromonas canoris sp. nov., an asaccharolytic, black-pigmented species from the gingival sulcus of dogs.
AB  - A new species, Porphyromonas canoris, is proposed for black-pigmented asaccharolytic strains isolated from subgingival plaque samples from dogs with naturally occurring periodontal disease. This bacterium is an obligately anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organism. On laked rabbit blood or sheep blood agar plates, colonies are light brown to greenish brown after 2 to 4 days of incubation and dark brown after 14 days of incubation. Colonies on egg yolk agar and on nonhemolyzed sheep blood agar are orange. The cells do not grow in the presence of 20% bile and have a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 49 to 51 mol%. The type strain is VPB 4878 (= NCTC 12835). The average levels of DNA-DNA hybridization between P. canoris strains and other members of the genus Porphyromonas are as follows: Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277T (T = type strain), 6.5%; Porphyromonas gingivalis cat strain VPB 3492, 5%; Porphyromonas endodontalis ATCC 35406T, 1%; Porphyromonas salivosa NCTC 11362T, 5%; and Porphyromonas circumdentaria NCTC 12469T, 6%. The level of hybridization between P. canoris NCTC 12835T DNA and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica ATCC 25260T DNA is 3%. P. canoris cells produce major amounts of acetic, propionic, isovaleric, and succinic acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and butyric acids as end products of metabolism in cooked meat medium. The major cellular fatty acid is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-C15:0). Glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present, as are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (65.7 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (63.0 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Hydrolytic enzymes and lectin-binding activity of black-pigmented anaerobic rods.
AB  - Recent taxonomic studies on black-pigmented anaerobic rods, a group of bacteria found on mucosal surfaces of humans and animals, led to the subdivision of existing species and to the creation of new species. The aim of this study was to characterize all 11 currently recognized species of black-pigmented bacteria (55 strains) for their ability to hydrolyse a variety of natural and synthetic substrates and for their lectin reactivity. Although most of the strains demonstrated some activity against proteinaceous substrates, Porphyromonas gingivalis was the only species able to hydrolyse type I collagen. Most strains possessed glycylprolyl protease activity, elastase-like activity and phospholipase C activity, whereas trypsin-like activity was restricted to P. gingivalis, Porphyromonas salivosa and Bacteroides macacae. beta-Lactamase activity was demonstrated in five strains belonging to the saccharolytic group. The lectin reactivity of the bacteria was determined by a dot-blot procedure using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated lectins. Three lectins, LOTUS A, RCA-I and ConA, failed to react with any of the bacteria tested. WGA reacted strongly with the cell surface of human biotypes of asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteria (P. gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis) and Prevotella intermedia. The animal biotype strains of P. gingivalis showed a higher affinity for SBA and PNA than for WGA.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - The efficacy of tinidazole in naturally occurring periodontitis in dogs: bacteriological and clinical results.
AB  - The efficacy of tinidazole in addition to a single course of scaling was studied  in 14 dogs with periodontitis. Three test teeth, two with periodontitis and one with healthy periodontium, were selected per dog. Subgingival bacterial samples were taken, and clinical examination was carried out at each of four visits (0, 14, 90 and 180 days). The bacterial samples were cultured anaerobically using selective and nonselective media. All teeth in the dentition, except one diseased test tooth with periodontitis were scaled at the first visit and tinidazole or placebo administered twice a day for 7 days. The mean probing depth of the diseased test pockets was significantly more reduced in tinidazole+scaling (T1S1) than scaling alone (T0S1) group at all visits compared to baseline values. The most significant decreases of bacterial counts in T1 or T0 groups were found in agar corroding Gram-negative rods in both diseased and healthy T1S1 pockets and in slimy Gram-negative rods in diseased T1S0 pockets between visits 1 and 2. The intergroup comparisons showed that Gram-positive cocci decreased significantly more in S1 pockets as well as sporeforming Gram-positive rods in diseased S0 pockets of T1 than T0 group. The highest number of isolates was found in the group of pigmented Gram-negative anaerobe rods, mainly Porphyromonas spp. The percentage of Porphyromonas gingivalis-like isolates decreased to zero and Porphyromonas endodontalis-like isolates increased in all test teeth of T1 group at 14 days. It is concluded that tinidazole has good efficacy against P. gingivalis-like bacteria which seem to be periodontal pathogens in dogs.
TI  - Oral and dental infections with anaerobic bacteria: clinical features, predominant pathogens, and treatment.
AB  - Microbial populations colonizing the teeth are a major source of pathogens responsible for oral and dental infections, including periodontal diseases, gingivitis, pericoronitis, endodontitis, peri-implantitis, and postextraction infections. Each entity has distinct clinical and microbial features. Bacterial species associated with oral infections include Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Treponema pallidum-related spirochetes have been associated with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. Porphyromonas endodontalis appears to be specifically related to endodontic infections. Oral infections in medically compromised patients, including those with AIDS, are associated with similar species and are usually complicated by superinfection with enteric and Candida species. Isolation of species causing oral infections requires the collection of appropriate samples and the use of strictly anaerobic techniques. Rapid selective culture, immunofluorescence, and DNA probe methods have been developed for the identification of these oral species. The varied measures required in the management of oral and dental infections may include antimicrobial therapy. Accurate microbiological diagnosis, including antibiotic susceptibility testing, is indicated for cases that do not respond to therapy.
TI  - Black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  - Necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. The number of different species in one canal is usually low, approx. 4-7 species. The species isolated most frequently belong to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Streptococcus. The frequency of isolation of black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. Pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by Pr. denticola and two Porphyromonas species, P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis. Several studies have shown that P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis are closely related to the presence of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes are not. However, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. Moreover, Porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. Although Porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.
TI  - Porphyromonas-like gram-negative rods in naturally occurring periodontitis in dogs.
AB  - A total of 259 Gram-negative Porphyromonas-like rods isolated from subgingival plaque samples of 16 family-owned dogs with naturally occurring periodontitis were characterized phenotypically by biochemical reactions, metabolic end products and enzymatic activities (API-ZYMTM, RoscoTM). Four distinct groups were found. Group A isolates (63) were asaccharolytic, lipase negative, trypsin positive and produced phenylacetic acid (PAA) from peptone-yeast extract glucose broth. Unlike P. gingivalis strains they were catalase positive. Group B isolates (42) differed from those of group A by a positive lipase reaction and from those of group D by failing to ferment sugars. Group C isolates (88) were asaccharolytic and did not produce PAA. They were alpha-fucosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (beta-NAG) and trypsin negative, resembling P. endodontalis, but unlike human isolates, they were catalase positive. Subgroup C.1 isolates (6) differed from those of parent group C by producing minor amounts of PAA, and subgroup C.2 isolates (12) were beta-NAG positive. Group D isolates (46) were weakly fermentative, lipase, catalase and trypsin positive, and produced PAA. They resembled the B (P.) salivosus type strain which, in our hands, fermented weakly glucose, lactose and mannose. Two isolates could not be assigned to any of the previous groups.
TI  - Classification of black-pigmented anaerobes by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS)  and conventional tests (CTs).
AB  - Clinical (66: dental 53; vaginal 4; wound 9) and reference (5*) strains of pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were examined in pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS) and conventional tests (CTs). The strains were identified in CTs as: Prevotella intermedia (48*); Pr. melaninogenica (1); Pr. corporis (7); Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (12*); P. endodontalis (1*) and P. gingivalis (2*). Numerical classification based on CTs resolved five clusters comprising strains identified as (I) Pr. corporis, (II) Pr. melaninogenica, (III) Pr. intermedia, (IV) P. gingivalis and (V) P. asaccharolytica and P. endodontalis. Numerical classification based on PMS showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity in the order Pr. intermedia, Pr. corporis, P. asaccharolytica, in agreement with the ordering of homogeneity for these species in CTs. PMS clusters corresponding the Porphyromonas spp. were clearly distinct from those of Prevotella spp. PMS and CT classifications disagreed on cluster membership for only six of the strains. PMS identification from blind challenge sets agreed with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.
TI  - Classification and typing methods of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB  - Until recently, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes were classified as 'black-pigmented Bacteroides'. At present, 11 distinct species are recognized in this group. Because of major differences with Bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus Bacteroides, new genera have been proposed: Porphyromonas for three asaccharolytic species, and Prevotella for the saccharolytic species. Typing methods have been developed for some species of black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes. These include biotyping and serotyping, but relatively few types can be distinguished with these methods. Recently, DNA restriction endonuclease analysis has been used for typing of P. gingivalis, Pr. intermedia and P. endodontalis strains. Great heterogeneity was observed within all three species. This typing method can be useful for epidemiological studies.
TI  - beta-Lactamase production and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - beta-Lactamase production by 98 Porphyromonas strains was investigated by the nitrocefin (chromogenic cephalosporin) test. Human isolates of P. gingivalis (91), P. endodontalis (2), and P. asaccharolytica (1) were tested, with four closely related Porphyromonas spp. of animal origin and four reference strains. The in vitro susceptibility of 64 P. gingivalis strains was investigated on Brucella blood agar by the E test. None of the human Porphyromonas isolates tested produced beta-lactamase, but one Porphyromonas strain of animal origin, most closely resembling P. endodontalis, produced beta-lactamase. P. gingivalis was susceptible to almost all of the drugs tested: benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin; all strains were inhibited at 0.016 microgram/ml, 0.023 microgram/ml, 0.315 microgram/ml, 0.064 microgram/ml, 0.19 microgram/ml, 0.016 microgram/ml, 0.094 microgram/ml, 0.047 microgram/ml, 0.023 microgram/ml, and 0.75 microgram/ml of these drugs, respectively. Cotrimoxazole exhibited variable efficacy against P. gingivalis; the range of MICs was 0.1095-32.0 micrograms/ml. The results indicate that beta-lactamase production is currently not a problem amongst clinical isolates of P. gingivalis and strains are susceptible to most antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  - Activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type I collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kDa trypsinlike protease from Porphyromas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), a 95-kDa chymotrypsinlike protease from Treponema denticola (ATCC 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. The bacteria included were Prevotella intermedia (ATCC 25261), Prevotella buccae (ES 57), Prevotella oris (ATCC 33573), Porphyromonas endodontalis (ES 54b), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 295222), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Mitsuokella dentalis (DSM 3688), and Streptococcus mitis (ATCC 15909). None of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. The fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. The proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of TIMP-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. None of the studied bacteria, proteases from P. gingivalis and T. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. However, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. Our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. Thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal tissue destruction.
TI  - Classification of oral pigmented anaerobic bacilli by pyrolysis mass spectrometry and biochemical tests.
AB  - Clinical (66) and reference (5) strains of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, identified as Prevotella intermedia (47), Pr. melaninogenica (1), Pr. corpora (8), Porphyromonas asaccharolyticus (12), P. endodontalis (1) and P. gingivalis (2), were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS) and in conventional tests. Numerical classification based on conventional test reaction patterns (CTRPs) resolved five clusters, four comprising strains identified as Pr. intermedia, Pr. corpora, Pr. melaninogenica, and P. gingivalis respectively, and one comprising strains identified as P. asaccharolyticus and P. endodontalis. Numerical classification based on PMS showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity of chemical composition in the order Pr. intermedia, Pr. corpora, P. asaccharolyticus, which agreed with the order of homogeneity in CTRPs. PMS clusters corresponding to the genus Porphyromonas were clearly distinct from those of the genus Prevotella. PMS and CTRP classification disagreed on cluster membership for six strains. PMS identification from blind challenge sets was in agreement with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.
TI  - Further studies on some physical and biochemical characteristics of asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides of feline origin.
AB  - The ultrastructure of the appendages of 24 strains of asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides spp. of cats was studied by transmission electron microscopy. All strains examined by thin section showed abundant fimbriae, outer membrane vesicles and capsules. Negative staining showed fimbriae which varied from long, fine and wavy in Bact. salivosus and cat Group 2 to shorter, less abundant and thicker fimbriae in cat strains of Bact. gingivalis as well as type strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis and P. asaccharolytica. Capsular material was very thick amorphous in human P. gingivalis, cat strains of Bact. gingivalis and in P. assaccharolytica but fine and fibrillary in preparations of Bact. salivosus and cat Group 2 organisms. Wet india ink preparations showed a large capsule although those of Bact. salivosus and Group 2 appeared largest. Five-day Group 2 broth cultures featured a thick ropy growth consistent with a large accumulation of extracellular slime. Enzymatic activities of the 24 strains measured by API ZYM system as well as the conventional biochemical tests showed it was possible to differentiate reliably Bact. salivosus from the other cat strains of asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides species and from human P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis by a combination of these tests. These tests suggest that Bact. salivosus is unlikely to belong to the genus Prevotella. Its place within the genus Porphyromonas is still to be determined.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dental implant metals.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the specific in vitro antibacterial effect of seven dental implant metals on oral bacteria which have often been identified in failing implants. The metals chosen for evaluation were titanium, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, iron, gold, and vanadium. These metals were selected because they are contained in many commonly used dental implants. The bacteria selected for this study included isolates of Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaniogenica, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Actinomyces viscosus. Sets of tubes containing either supplemented trypticase soy broth, brain-heart infusion-yeast extract, or brain-heart infusion-yeast extract with 5 percent defibrinated rabbit blood were aseptically prepared with doubling dilutions of the seven metals starting at an initial concentration of 500 micrograms/ml and terminating at 0 microgram/ml. Cultures of each organism were inoculated into each set of broth tubes containing all concentrations of metals. Tubes were incubated either anaerobically or in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide for 48 hours at 35 degrees C and then assayed for ATP content which was proportional to the viable cellular biomass. The results showed that, although being bacteria and concentration dependent, all seven metals suppressed the growth of each organism. The rank order of antibacterial activity expressed by dental implant metals was gold > titanium > cobalt > vanadium > aluminum > chromium > iron.
TI  - Rapid presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by using 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives.
AB  - A rapid method for presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was developed. Using filter paper spot tests for indole production, sialidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and trypsinlike enzyme activities, 100% of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Bacteroides levii and 89% of Prevotella corporis isolates were correctly identified to the species level. Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis could not be differentiated from each other but could be distinguished from all other species tested. Similarly, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, and Prevotella melaninogenica could not be differentiated from each other. The methods described are based on 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives of the various substrates and are simple to perform, rapid (less than 15 min), and applicable to difficult-to-cultivate anaerobic rods.
TI  - Humoral immune response to an antigen from Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 in periodontal disease.
AB  - The humoral immune responses of patients with periodontitis were evaluated to characterize the host response to Porphyromonas gingivalis. A sonic extract of P. gingivalis 381 from whole cells was fractionated by gel chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. The fractionated extracts were evaluated by Western blot (immunoblot) analyses with patient sera. A dominant antigen was identified from the sonic extract with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa. The 53-kDa protein antigen (Ag53) was purified by affinity chromatography by using a monoclonal antibody. Ag53 was detected on the vesicle surface of P. gingivalis 381 by immunoelectron microscopy by using the monoclonal antibody and was detected as a major protein in the outer membrane and in vesicles by Western blot analysis. Monoclonal antibody cross-reactivity to Ag53 in the sonic extracts of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P. gingivalis 1021, and Porphyromonas endodontalis ATCC 35406 was revealed. Seventy-seven patients with periodontitis were examined for their responses to Ag53. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 54 patients reacted strongly to Ag53; however, serum IgG from the remaining 23 patients did not exhibit detectable reactivity at all to Ag53, even though the patients had high serum IgG titers to the sonic extract. Ag53 is a new marker that represents an interesting aspect of the humoral immune response to P. gingivalis in patients with periodontitis.
TI  - Reactivity of IgG from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  - The presence of IgG in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. The purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of IgG from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. A dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was used to demonstrate the presence of IgG in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. The percentages of reactivity by dot-ELISA follow: Bacteroides intermedius (84%), B. buccae (12%), Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), P. endodontalis (58%), P. asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus micros (44%), P. anaerobius (26%), Eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and Actinomyces israelii (6%). At least one of the three species of B. intermedius, P. gingivalis, or P. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-ELISA with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. A lack of cross reactivity of IgG in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented Bacteroides/Porphyromonas by dot-ELISA.
TI  - Hydrophobicities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and oral Bacteroides and Porphyromonas spp., Wolinella recta, and Eubacterium yurii with special reference to bacterial surface structures.
AB  - The hydrophobicities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and Bacteroides buccae, B. oris, B. oralis, B. veroralis, B. buccalis, B. heparinolyticus, B. intermedius, B. denticola, B. loescheii, B. melaninogenicus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, Wolinella recta, and Eubacterium yurii were studied by the hexadecane method. The majority of the strains were equally or less hydrophobic than the PMNLs. Only in the case of E. yurii and the only strain of B. buccalis were all strains more hydrophobic than the PMNLs. However, some strains of B. intermedius, B. oris, B. denticola, and P. gingivalis were also more hydrophobic than the PMNLs. With the exception of B. intermedius and species with a crystalline surface protein layer (S-layer), the strains of all other species with a thick capsule were more hydrophilic than the strains with little or no extracellular polymeric material. All strains of the S-layer species were either quite hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the species, totally irrespective of the presence of the capsule. The results suggest that the S-layers of oral anaerobic bacteria may be important determinants of cell surface hydrophobicity.
TI  - The formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  - The capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. A majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from L-cysteine. The most active bacteria were found in the genera Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Selenomonas, Centipeda, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Methyl mercaptan from L-methionine was formed by some members of the genera Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Eubacterium. When incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were Treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loescheii, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. No other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of L-cysteine and L-methionine. These findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - Taxonomy, virulence and epidemiology of black-pigmented Bacteroides species in relation to oral infections.
AB  - Black-pigmented Bacteroides species are recognized as suspected pathogens of oral infections. Developments in the taxonomy of this group include description of a new asaccharolytic species, Bacteroides salivosus, and proposal for the reclassification of the asaccharolytic species into a separate genus, Porphyromonas. Studies on the pathogenicity and virulence of black-pigmented Bacteroides species have identified Bacteroides gingivalis as the most virulent species. B. gingivalis and Bacteroides intermedius have been associated with periodontal diseases; Bacteroides endodontalis is isolated specifically from infections in the oral cavity, and other black-pigmented Bacteroides species are recovered from oral mucous sites. DNA restriction endonuclease analysis was adapted for typing of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius.
TI  - Cross-inhibition between black-pigmented Bacteroides species.
AB  - Cross-inhibition within the group of black-pigmented Bacteroides, including both  oral and non-oral strains, was studied by means of a membrane filter technique. It was found that B. gingivalis possessed the most extended inhibitory capacity among all species tested. B. gingivalis showed inhibitory activity against B. intermedius, B. endodontalis, B. loescheii, and B. melaninogenicus. B. endodontalis was active against some B. intermedius strains. Among the saccharolytic species, some B. melaninogenicus strains were inhibitory for some B. endodontalis strains, some B. gingivalis strains, and some B. intermedius strains. These inhibitory activities observed in vitro may play a role in the colonization of the periodontal pocket.
