TI  == enhancement of biodegradation of crude petroleum-oil in contaminated water by the addition of nitrogen sources.
AB  == addition of nitrogen sources as supplementary nutrient into msm medium to enhance biodegradation by stimulating the growth four isolates, acinetobacter faecalis, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas putida and neisseria elongata isolated from petroleum contaminated groundwater, wastewater aeration pond and biopond at the oil refinery terengganu malaysia was investigated. the organic nitrogen sources tested not only supported growth but also enhances biodegradation of 1% tapis crude oil. all four isolates showed good growth especially when peptone was employed as the organic nitrogen compared to growth in the basal medium. gas chromatography showed that more then 91, 93, 94 and 95% degradation of total hydrocarbon was observed after 5 days of incubation by isolates pseudomonas putida, neisseria elongate, acinetobacter faecalis and staphylococcus sp., respectively.

TI  == growth enhancement of effective microorganisms for bioremediation of crude oil contaminated waters.
AB  == the bioremediation of polluted groundwater, wastewater aeration pond and biopond  sites was investigated using bacteria isolated from these sites located at the oil refinery terengganu malaysia. out of 62 isolates, only 16 isolates from groundwater (8) and wastewater aeration pond (3) and biopond (5) were chosen based on growth medium containing 1% (v/v) tapis crude oil. only four isolates; acinetobacter faecalis, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas putida and neisseria elongata showed percentage biodegradation of crude oil more than 50% after 5 days using mineral salts medium (msm). the effect of physical parameters (temperature, ph and agitation) on growth by all four strains showed a maximum growth in msm medium with 1% tapis crude oil at 37 degrees c with ph 7 and agitation of 130 rpm.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
