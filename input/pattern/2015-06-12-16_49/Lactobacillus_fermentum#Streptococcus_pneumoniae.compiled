TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and Salmonella infection in murine models.
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179, Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287 and Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 were studied for their probiotic potential. Firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was active against five streptococci, including the two pathogenic strains Streptococcus oralis LMG 14532T and Streptococcus pneumoniae LMG 14545T. S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was active against the majority of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food spoilage or pathogenic species. The three potential probiotic strains were found to survive variably at pH 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. Only S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the strains was haemolytic. Moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics. L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Also elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 were observed with L. fermentum ACA-DC 179. This strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in a TNBS-induced colitis mouse model. Furthermore, L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 was successfully applied in an experimental Salmonella-infection mouse model. To conclude, strain L. fermentum ACA-DC 179 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Effect of Ampicillin on the kinetics of colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Lactobacillus fermentum in the respiratory tract of mice.
AB  - Ampicillin was selected to further study the effect of this antibiotic on the colonization capability of S. pneumoniae and L. fermentum intranasally inoculated in a mice experimental model. The sensitivity of S. pneumoniae and L. fermentum to antibiotics was evaluated by different "in vitro" techniques. The results showed that both microorganisms have a typical pattern of sensitivity to antibiotics in these assays. The "in vivo" experiments showed that the treatment with Ampicillin increased the number of lactobacilli and neumococci in the groups of mice treated only with one of the microorganisms. In those mice treated with Lactobacillus, challenged later with neumococci and treated with Ampicillin, the pathogen in lung decreased on the 4th day, disappearing completely after on. The histological studies showed that the antibiotic treatment decreased the inflammatory response produced by the pathogen at the lung and trachea levels.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Protective effect of intranasally inoculated Lactobacillus fermentum against Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge on the mouse respiratory tract.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are increasingly used to restore the ecological equilibrium  of different mucosal areas in humans and/or animals. Likewise, they can be used to potentially protect against pathogenic microorganisms. In the present paper, the preventive effect of intranasally inoculated Lactobacillus fermentum against challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied, using a mouse experimental model. L. fermentum inoculated four times at a dose of 10(7) colony forming units per mouse was able to decrease the number of S. pneumoniae throughout the respiratory tract. The L. fermentum treatment increased the number of activated macrophages in lung slices, and a higher lymphocyte population in the tracheal lamina propria. S. pneumoniae challenge showed a typical response against pathogen with a higher non-specific immune response. Preventive treatment, i.e. L. fermentum administration prior to S. pneumoniae challenge, showed a response close to that of L. fermentum. Anti-S. pneumoniae antibodies increased in lactobacilli-treated animals compared to the non-treated lactobacilli mice. The increase in the antibody levels suggests that the mucosal immune system could be involved in the protective effect, accomplished with competitive exclusion, nutrient competition and production of inhibitory substances. This paper will be the basis for further studies of the protective effect of lactobacilli against S. pneumoniae in the respiratory tract.
TI  - The binding of Pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid to human erythrocytes.
AB  - Previous studies have evaluated the binding characteristics of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) composed of polyglycerol phosphate to mammalian cell membranes. This present study was performed to evaluate the binding characteristics of Pneumococcal LTA, a polyribitol phosphate containing LTA, to human erythrocytes. Binding was found to be specific, reversible, and dependent on temperature and time. Maximum binding was achieved within 2 h at 37 degrees C. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding revealed a biphasic plot which suggests two receptor sites with different affinities. Competitive inhibition studies with LTA composed of polyglycerol phosphate and isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes and Lactobacillus fermentum revealed significant inhibition of Pneumococcal LTA-binding to the erythrocyte membrane by these heterologous LTAs. These results demonstrate that Pneumococcal LTA binds specifically to human erythrocytes and that the receptor site is similar for other structurally different LTAs.
TI  - Effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial population of Nigerian orange juice.
AB  - The effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial load of Nigerian orange juice was studied over a period of 1 month. Results obtained indicated that pasteurization at 60 degrees and 80 degrees C for 20 to 40 min, freezing at -5 degrees C, and addition of sodium benzoate at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.4% (w/v) could form a microbiological basis for the preservation of the juice for 1 month. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. paramesenteroides, Streptococcus avium, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. fermentum, L. fructivorans, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the micro-organisms isolated from the untreated and treated juice samples.
TI  - The ability to sensitize host cells for destruction by autologous complement is a general property of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Streptococcus pneumoniae binds to erythrocytes and renders them susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. The present study was performed to determine whether LTA from two other gram-positive bacterial species had the ability to render mammalian cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement. Human erythrocytes were sensitized with LTA from S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Lactobacillus fermentum. Under incubation in normal autologous serum, lysis was observed with each of the LTA-sensitized erythrocyte preparations. When erythrocytes from a C2-deficient patient were sensitized with the LTA preparations and then incubated in autologous, C2-deficient serum, the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pyogenes or L. fermentum LTA demonstrated relatively little lysis, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pneumoniae LTA yielded near-total lysis. After reconstitution of the C2-deficient serum with purified human C2, lysis was observed with all three LTA preparations. When erythrocytes from an agammaglobulinemic patient were sensitized with either the S. pyogenes or the L. fermentum LTA, they were not lysed in the presence of autologous agammaglobulinemic serum, whereas the erythrocytes sensitized with S. pneumoniae LTA were completely lysed. Serum obtained from the agammaglobulinemic patient after reconstitution with intravenous pooled gamma globulin was able to lyse autologous erythrocytes sensitized with each of the three LTA preparations. These results demonstrate that the ability to render host cells susceptible to lysis by autologous complement is a general property of LTA. Whether activation of the autologous complement occurs by the classical or alternative pathways and whether it is antibody dependent depends on the nature of the bacterial LTA.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
