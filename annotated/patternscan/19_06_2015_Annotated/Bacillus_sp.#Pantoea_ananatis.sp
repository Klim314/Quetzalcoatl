TI  == isolation and characterization of indigenous endophytic bacteria associated with  leaves of switchgrass (panicum virgatum l.) cultivars.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial endophytes from cultivars  of switchgrass and study their antimicrobial and growth promoting potential. methods and results: the diversity, molecular and biochemical characterizations of indigenous and culturable bacterial endophytes residing in leaves of switchgrass have not been studied previously. this study describes the characterization of 31 bacterial endophytes from three switchgrass cutlivars: cave-in rock, blue jacket and tecumseh. molecular and phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna sequence grouped the endophytes into eight different taxa that shared high homology of 98-99% with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as microbacterium testaceum, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, bacillus subtilis and bacillus pumilus, pseudomonas fluorescens, sphingomonas parapaucimobilis, serratia sp. and pantoea ananatis. some endophytes were detected in switchgrass seeds and in plants that originated from seeds collected  a year earlier, confirming vertical transmission to the next generation of the host. selected endophytes produced cellulases and were capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus. analysis of cell-free culture filtrate of selected strains  using direct infusion orbitrap mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of several well-characterized lipopeptide toxins and phytohormones. re-inoculation of the roots of switchgrass seedlings with endophytes singly or combined confirmed their migration to the upper aerial parts of the plant. conclusions: our findings suggest that switchgrass leaves harbour a diversity of bacterial endophytes, some of which could potentially be applied as growth promoting bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report on the characterization of indigenous bacterial endophytes and their potential use as biofertilizers.

TI  == culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community from chungkookjang, a traditional korean fermented soybean food.
AB  == the bacterial community of chungkookjang and raw rice-straw collected from various areas in south korea was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. pure cultures were isolated from chungkookjang and raw rice-straw on tryptic soy agar plates with 72 to 121 colonies and identified  by 16s rdna gene sequence analysis, respectively. the traditional culture-based method and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of pcr-amplified 16s  rdna confirmed that pantoea agglomerans and b. subtilis were identified as predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang, respectively, from iljuk district of gyeonggi province, p. ananatis and b. licheniformis were identified as predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang from wonju district of gangwon province, and microbacterium sp. and b. licheniformis were identified as  predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang from sunchang district of jeolla province. other strains, such as bacillus, enterococcus, pseudomonas, rhodococcus, and uncultured bacteria were also present in raw rice-straw and chungkookjang. practical application: a comprehensive analysis of these microorganisms would provide a more detailed understanding of the biologically active components of chungkookjang and help improve its quality. polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis can be successfully applied to a fermented food to detect unculturable or more species than the culture-dependent method. this technique is an effective and convenient culture-independent method for studying the bacterial community in chungkookjang. in this study, the bacterial community of chungkookjang collected from various areas in south korea was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.

TI  == characterization of microbial contamination in united states air force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  == bacteria and fungi, isolated from united states air force (usaf) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (gc-fame) profiling and 16s or 18s rrna gene sequencing. thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated usaf bases were collected. at each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. twelve genera, including four bacillus species and two staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. of the organisms identified, bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, sphinogmonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and the fungus aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. the bacteria pantoea ananatis, arthrobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., kocuria rhizophilia, leucobacter komagatae, dietza sp., and the fungus discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in usaf aviation fuel. only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and  identification techniques.
