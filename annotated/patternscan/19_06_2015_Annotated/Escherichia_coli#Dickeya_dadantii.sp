TI  == the role for tola in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli pathogenesis and virulence gene transcription.
AB  == loss of the periplasm spanning protein tola in escherichia coli leads to activation of the rcs phosphorelay, and is required for full virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica and dickeya dadantii. this study explores the role for tola in the pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) and the effect of its mutation on the transcription of key ehec virulence  genes controlled by rcs phosphorelay, including the type iii secretion system (t3ss) (espa and tir), the e. coli common pilus (ecpa), and motility (flic). promoter activity for t3ss regulator ler was substantially higher following inactivation of tola, and corresponded with a similar elevation in espa and tir transcription. likewise, ecpa transcription was increased in ehecdeltatola. conversely, and in-line with previous studies, inactivation of tola resulted in complete loss of motility and decreased flic transcription. for all genes examined, altered transcription observed for ehecdeltatola was dependent on the outer-membrane lipoprotein rcsf. despite elevated virulence gene transcription, in tola deleted strains virulence of ehec in the galleria mellonella wax worm model was substantially attenuated in a manner at least partly dependent on rcsf, and adherence to cultured ht-29 colonic epithelial cells was markedly reduced. the results of this study broaden the role for tola in ehec pathogenesis, and suggest that significant outer-membrane perturbations are able to promote transcription of important ehec adherence factors.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) from glucose.
AB  == the escherichia coli xl1-blue strain was metabolically engineered to synthesize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [p(3hb-co-3hv)] through 2-ketobutyrate, which is generated via citramalate pathway, as a precursor for propionyl-coa. two different metabolic pathways were examined for the synthesis of propionyl-coa from 2-ketobutyrate. the first pathway is composed of the dickeya dadantii 3937 2-ketobutyrate oxidase or the e. coli pyruvate oxidase mutant (poxb l253f v380a) for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionate and the ralstonia eutropha propionyl-coa synthetase (prpe) or the e. coli acetyl-coa:acetoacetyl-coa transferase for further conversion of propionate into  propionyl-coa. the second pathway employs pyruvate formate lyase encoded by the e. coli tdce gene or the clostridium difficile pflb gene for the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa. as the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa could not support the efficient production of p(3hb-co-3hv) from glucose, the first metabolic pathway was further examined. when the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue strain equipped with citramalate pathway expressing the e. coli poxb l253f v380a gene and r. eutropha prpe gene together with the r. eutropha pha biosynthesis genes was cultured in a chemically defined  medium containing 20 g/l of glucose as a sole carbon source, p(3hb-co-2.3 mol% 3hv) was produced up to the polymer content of 61.7 wt.%. moreover, the 3hv monomer fraction in p(3hb-co-3hv) could be increased up to 5.5 mol% by additional deletion of the prpc and scpc genes, which are responsible for the metabolism of  propionyl-coa in host strains.

TI  == anatomy of secretin binding to the dickeya dadantii type ii secretion system pilotin.
AB  == the secretins are a family of large multimeric channels in the outer membrane of  gram-negative bacteria that are involved in protein export. in dickeya dadantii and many other pathogenic bacteria, the lipoprotein pilotin targets the secretin  subunits to the outer membrane, allowing a functional type ii secretion system to be assembled. here, the crystal structure of the c-terminal peptide of the secretin subunit bound to its cognate pilotin is reported. in solution, this c-terminal region of the secretin is nonstructured. the secretin peptide folds on binding to the pilotin to form just under four turns of alpha-helix which bind tightly up against the first helix of the pilotin so that the hydrophobic residues of the secretin helix can bind to the hydrophobic surface of the pilotin. the secretin helix binds parallel to the first part of the fourth helix  of the pilotin. an n-capping aspartate encourages helix formation and binding by  interacting favourably with the helix dipole of the helical secretin peptide. the structure of the secretin-pilotin complex of the phytopathogenic d. dadantii described here is a paradigm for this interaction in the outs-puls family of pilotins, which is essential for the correct assembly of the type ii secretion system of several potent human adversaries, including enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == delivery of cdia nuclease toxins into target cells during contact-dependent growth inhibition.
AB  == bacterial contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) is mediated by the cdib/cdia  family of two-partner secretion proteins. cdi systems deploy a variety of distinct toxins, which are contained within the polymorphic c-terminal region (cdia-ct) of cdia proteins. several cdia-cts are nucleases, suggesting that the toxins are transported into the target cell cytoplasm to interact with their substrates. to analyze cdia transfer to target bacteria, we used the cdi system of uropathogenic escherichia coli 536 (upec536) as a model. antibodies recognizing the amino- and carboxyl-termini of cdia(upec536) were used to visualize transfer of cdia from cdi(upec536+) inhibitor cells to target cells using fluorescence microscopy. the results indicate that the entire cdia(upec536) protein is deposited onto the surface of target bacteria. cdia(upec536) transfer  to bama101 mutants is reduced, consistent with low expression of the cdi receptor bama on these cells. notably, our results indicate that the c-terminal cdia-ct toxin region of cdia(upec536) is translocated into target cells, but the n-terminal region remains at the cell surface based on protease sensitivity. these results suggest that the cdia-ct toxin domain is cleaved from cdia(upec536) prior to translocation. delivery of a heterologous dickeya dadantii cdia-ct toxin, which has dnase activity, was also visualized. following incubation with cdi(+) inhibitor cells targets became anucleate, showing that the d.dadantii cdia-ct was delivered intracellularly. together, these results demonstrate that diverse cdi toxins are efficiently translocated across target cell envelopes.

TI  == sura is involved in the targeting to the outer membrane of a tat signal sequence-anchored protein.
AB  == the twin arginine translocation (tat) pathway exports folded proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of bacteria. the targeting of the exported proteins to the tat pathway relies on a specific amino-terminal signal sequence, which is cleaved after exportation. in the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii, the pectin lyase homologue pnlh is exported by the tat pathway without cleavage of its signal sequence, which anchors pnlh into the outer membrane. in proteobacteria, the vast majority of outer membrane proteins consists of beta-barrel proteins and lipoproteins. thus, pnlh represents a new kind of outer membrane protein. in escherichia coli, periplasmic chaperones sura, skp, and degp work together with the beta-barrel assembly machinery (bam) to target and insert beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. in this work, we showed that sura is required for an efficient targeting of pnlh to the outer membrane. moreover, we were able  to detect an in vitro interaction between sura and the pnlh signal sequence. since the pnlh signal sequence contains a highly hydrophobic region, we propose that sura protects it from the hydrophobic periplasm during targeting of pnlh to  the outer membrane. we also studied the nature of the information carried by the  pnlh signal sequence responsible for its targeting to the outer membrane after exportation by the tat system.

TI  == evolution of the metabolic and regulatory networks associated with oxygen availability in two phytopathogenic enterobacteria.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum are phytopathogenic  enterobacteria capable of facultative anaerobic growth in a wide range of o2 concentrations found in plant and natural environments. the transcriptional response to o2 remains under-explored for these and other phytopathogenic enterobacteria although it has been well characterized for animal-associated genera including escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. knowledge of the extent of conservation of the transcriptional response across orthologous genes in more distantly related species is useful to identify rates and patterns of regulon evolution. evolutionary events such as loss and acquisition of genes by lateral transfer events along each evolutionary branch results in lineage-specific genes, some of which may have been subsequently incorporated into the o2-responsive stimulon. here we present a comparison of transcriptional  profiles measured using densely tiled oligonucleotide arrays for two phytopathogens, dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043, grown to mid-log phase in mops minimal medium (0.1% glucose) with and without o2. results: more than 7% of the genes of each phytopathogen are differentially expressed with greater than 3-fold changes under anaerobic conditions. in addition to anaerobic metabolism genes, the o2 responsive stimulon includes a variety of virulence and pathogenicity-genes. few of these genes overlap with orthologous genes in the anaerobic stimulon of e. coli. we define these as the conserved core, in which the transcriptional pattern as well as genetic architecture are well preserved. this conserved core includes previously described anaerobic metabolic pathways such as fermentation. other components of  the anaerobic stimulon show variation in genetic content, genome architecture and regulation. notably formate metabolism, nitrate/nitrite metabolism, and fermentative butanediol production, differ between e. coli and the phytopathogens. surprisingly, the overlap of the anaerobic stimulon between the phytopathogens is also relatively small considering that they are closely related, occupy similar niches and employ similar strategies to cause disease. there are cases of interesting divergences in the pattern of transcription of genes between dickeya and pectobacterium for virulence-associated subsystems including the type vi secretion system (t6ss), suggesting that fine-tuning of the stimulon impacts interaction with plants or competing microbes. conclusions: the  small number of genes (an even smaller number if we consider operons) comprising  the conserved core transcriptional response to o2 limitation demonstrates the extent of regulatory divergence prevalent in the enterobacteriaceae. our orthology-driven comparative transcriptomics approach indicates that the adaptive response in the eneterobacteria is a result of interaction of core (regulators) and lineage-specific (structural and regulatory) genes. our subsystems based approach reveals that similar phenotypic outcomes are sometimes achieved by each  organism using different genes and regulatory strategies.

TI  == the toxin/immunity network of burkholderia pseudomallei contact-dependent growth  inhibition (cdi) systems.
AB  == burkholderia pseudomallei is a category b pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis--a serious infectious disease that is typically acquired directly from environmental reservoirs. nearly all b. pseudomallei strains sequenced to date (> 85 isolates) contain gene clusters that are related to the contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) systems of gamma-proteobacteria. cdi systems from escherichia coli and dickeya dadantii play significant roles in bacterial competition, suggesting these systems may also contribute to the competitive fitness of b. pseudomallei. here, we identify 10 distinct cdi systems in b. pseudomallei based on polymorphisms within the cdia-ct/cdii coding regions, which are predicted to encode cdia-ct/cdii toxin/immunity protein pairs. biochemical analysis of three b. pseudomallei cdia-cts revealed that each protein possesses a distinct trnase activity capable of inhibiting cell growth. these toxin activities are blocked by cognate cdii immunity proteins, which specifically bind the cdia-ct and protect cells from growth inhibition. using burkholderia thailandensis e264 as a model, we show that a cdi system from b. pseudomallei 1026b mediates cdi and is capable of delivering cdia-ct toxins derived from other b. pseudomallei strains. these results demonstrate that burkholderia species contain functional cdi systems, which may confer a competitive advantage to these bacteria.

TI  == identification of functional toxin/immunity genes linked to contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) and rearrangement hotspot (rhs) systems.
AB  == bacterial contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) is mediated by the cdia/cdib  family of two-partner secretion proteins. each cdia protein exhibits a distinct growth inhibition activity, which resides in the polymorphic c-terminal region (cdia-ct). cdi(+) cells also express unique cdii immunity proteins that specifically block the activity of cognate cdia-ct, thereby protecting the cell from autoinhibition. here we show that many cdi systems contain multiple cdia gene fragments that encode cdia-ct sequences. these "orphan" cdia-ct genes are almost always associated with downstream cdii genes to form cdia-ct/cdii modules. comparative genome analyses suggest that cdia-ct/cdii modules are mobile and exchanged between the cdi systems of different bacteria. in many instances, orphan cdia-ct/cdii modules are fused to full-length cdia genes in other bacterial species. examination of cdia-ct/cdii modules from escherichia coli ec93, e. coli ec869, and dickeya dadantii 3937 confirmed that these genes encode  functional toxin/immunity pairs. moreover, the orphan module from ec93 was functional in cell-mediated cdi when fused to the n-terminal portion of the ec93  cdia protein. bioinformatic analyses revealed that the genetic organization of cdi systems shares features with rhs (rearrangement hotspot) loci. rhs proteins also contain polymorphic c-terminal regions (rhs-cts), some of which share significant sequence identity with cdia-cts. all rhs genes are followed by small  orfs representing possible rhsi immunity genes, and several rhs systems encode orphan rhs-ct/rhsi modules. analysis of rhs-ct/rhsi modules from d. dadantii 3937 demonstrated that rhs-cts have growth inhibitory activity, which is specifically  blocked by cognate rhsi immunity proteins. together, these results suggest that rhs plays a role in intercellular competition and that orphan gene modules expand the diversity of toxic activities deployed by both cdi and rhs systems.

TI  == tmrna regulates synthesis of the arfa ribosome rescue factor.
AB  == translation of mrna lacking an in-frame stop codon leads to ribosome arrest at the 3' end of the transcript. in bacteria, the tmrna quality control system recycles these stalled ribosomes and tags the incomplete nascent chains for degradation. although ubiquitous in eubacteria, the ssra gene encoding tmrna is not essential for the viability of escherichia coli and other model bacterial species. arfa (yhdl) is a mediator of tmrna-independent ribosome rescue that is essential for the viability of e. colideltassra mutants. here, we demonstrate that arfa is synthesized from truncated mrna and therefore regulated by tmrna tagging activity. rnase iii cleaves a hairpin structure within the arfa-coding sequence to produce transcripts that lack stop codons. in the absence of tmrna tagging, truncated arfa chains are released from the ribosome. the truncated arfadelta18 protein (which lacks 18 c-terminal residues) is functional in ribosome rescue and supports deltassra cell viability when expressed from the arfa locus. other proteobacterial arfa genes also encode hairpins, and transcripts from dickeya dadantii and salmonella typhimurium are cleaved by rnase iii when expressed in e. coli. thus, synthesis of arfa from truncated mrna appears to be a general mechanism to regulate alternative ribosome rescue activity.

TI  == a widespread family of polymorphic contact-dependent toxin delivery systems in bacteria.
AB  == bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with one another in diverse environments. a new form of intercellular communication, contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi), was discovered recently in escherichia coli. cdi is mediated by the cdib/cdia two-partner secretion (tps) system. cdib facilitates secretion of the cdia 'exoprotein' onto the cell surface. an additional small immunity protein (cdii) protects cdi(+) cells from autoinhibition. the mechanisms by which cdi blocks cell growth and by which cdii  counteracts this growth arrest are unknown. moreover, the existence of cdi activity in other bacteria has not been explored. here we show that the cdi growth inhibitory activity resides within the carboxy-terminal region of cdia (cdia-ct), and that cdii binds and inactivates cognate cdia-ct, but not heterologous cdia-ct. bioinformatic and experimental analyses show that multiple  bacterial species encode functional cdi systems with high sequence variability in the cdia-ct and cdii coding regions. cdia-ct heterogeneity implies that a range of toxic activities are used during cdi. indeed, cdia-cts from uropathogenic e. coli and the plant pathogen dickeya dadantii have different nuclease activities,  each providing a distinct mechanism of growth inhibition. finally, we show that bacteria lacking the cdia-ct and cdii coding regions are unable to compete with isogenic wild-type cdi(+) cells both in laboratory media and on a eukaryotic host. taken together, these results suggest that cdi systems constitute an intricate immunity network with an important function in bacterial competition.

TI  == commensal effect of pectate lyases secreted from dickeya dadantii on proliferation of escherichia coli o157:h7 edl933 on lettuce leaves.
AB  == the outbreaks caused by enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 on leafy greens have raised serious and immediate food safety concerns. it has been suggested that several phytopathogens aid in the persistence and proliferation of the human enteropathogens in the phyllosphere. in this work, we examined the influence of virulence mechanisms of dickeya dadantii 3937, a broad-host-range phytopathogen, on the proliferation of the human pathogen e. coli o157:h7 edl933  (edl933) on postharvest lettuce by coinoculation of edl933 with d. dadantii 3937  derivatives that have mutations in virulence-related genes. a type ii secretion system (t2ss)-deficient mutant of d. dadantii 3937, a1919 (deltaoutc), lost the capability to promote the multiplication of edl933, whereas ech159 (deltarpos), a stress-responsive sigma factor rpos-deficient mutant, increased edl933 proliferation on lettuce leaves. a spectrophotometric enzyme activity assay revealed that a1919 (deltaoutc) was completely deficient in the secretion of pectate lyases (pels), which play a major role in plant tissue maceration. in contrast to a1919 (deltaoutc), ech159 (deltarpos) showed more than 2-fold-greater pel activity than the wild-type d. dadantii 3937. increased expression of peld (encodes an endo-pectate lyase) was observed in ech159 (deltarpos) in planta. these results suggest that the pectinolytic activity of d. dadantii 3937 is the dominant determinant of enhanced edl933 proliferation on the lettuce leaves. in addition, rpos, the general stress response sigma factor involved in cell survival in suboptimal conditions, plays a role in edl933 proliferation by controlling the production of pectate lyases in d. dadantii 3937.

TI  == novel mechanism of outer membrane targeting of proteins in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == summary: in gram-negative bacteria, all the proteins destined for the outer membrane are synthesized with a signal sequence that is cleaved, either by the signal peptidase lepb for integral outer membrane proteins or by lspa for lipoproteins, when they cross the cytoplasmic membrane. the dickeya dadantii protein pnlh does not possess a cleavable signal sequence but is anchored in the  outer membrane by an n-terminal targeting signal. addition of the 41 n-terminal amino acids of pnlh is sufficient for anchoring various hybrid proteins in the outer membrane. this targeting signal presents some of the characteristics of a tat (twin arginine translocation) signal sequence but without an obvious cleavage site. we found that the tat translocation pathway is required for the targeting process. this new mechanism of outer membrane protein targeting is probably widespread as pnlh was also addressed to the outer membrane when expressed in escherichia coli. as pnlh was not detected as a substrate by tat signal sequence  prediction programmes, this would suggest that there may be many other unknown tat-dependent outer membrane proteins.

TI  == differential regulation of two oligogalacturonate outer membrane channels, kdgn and kdgm, of dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi).
AB  == the entry of oligogalacturonates into dickeya dadantii occurs through the specific channel kdgm. the genome of the bacterium encodes a second member of this family of outer membrane proteins, kdgn. we showed that this protein is also involved in the uptake of oligogalacturonates. when kdgn was reconstituted in proteoliposomes, it formed channels with a conductance of about 450 ps at a positive potential. these channels had weak anionic selectivity. the regulation of kdgn is complex, and five genes controlling the expression of kdgn have been identified: kdgr, pecs, ompr, hns, and crp. moreover, kdgn was regulated by growth phase but only when bacteria were grown in rich medium. most of these regulators of kdgn also control kdgm expression, but some of them regulate kdgm in the opposite manner: while pecs and ompr are repressors of kdgm, they are activators of kdgn. this pattern resembles the regulation of the escherichia coli general porins ompf and ompc, but such opposite regulation of two specific outer  membrane channels has never been described before. kdgn may allow the bacteria to collect oligogalacturonates under saprophytic conditions, when virulence genes, including kdgm, are not expressed.
