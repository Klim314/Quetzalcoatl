TI  == construction of a novel secretion expression system guided by native signal peptide of phod in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == in the current study, three native signal peptides (sps) from phoc, phod, and zmo0331were investigated and compared to construct novel secretion expression systems in zymomonas mobilis. the secretion expression of target protein, alpha-amylase from bacillus amyloliquefaciens (baa), guided by phod's sp resulted in more hydrolysis of starch than that by the other two sps. extracellular and intracellular alpha-amylase activities of the strain containing phod's sp were also higher than the other two strains containing phoc or zmo0331's sp. in addition, the evidence by alcohol dehydrogenase activity assay further confirmed  that the starch hydrolysis was resulted from the secretion expression of baa rather than the breakage of cells. our results indicated that the sp of phod is able to serve as a promising candidate to assist secretion expression of heterogeneous genes in z. mobilis. this will contribute to development of engineered z. mobilis strains converting starch into ethanol.

TI  == semicontinuous production of ethanol from agricultural wastes by immobilised coculture in a two stage bioreactor.
AB  == the seed testing laboratories of maharashtra discard 10 tonnes of grains and oil  seeds treated with pesticides per annum. these agricultural wastes could be converted to reducing sugar and ethanol in a two stage semicontinuous fluidised bed bioreactor containing immobilised, bacillus sp. and zymomonas mobilis in the  1st stage and saccharomyces diastaticus and s. cerevisae in the 2nd stage. the optimum temperature and ph for fermentation in both the stages were 30 degrees c  and 7.2 respectively. in this process 600 g (approximately 400 g starch) waste seeds could yield 402 g of reducing sugar in the 1st stage after 20 h and 205 g ethanol in the 2nd stage after 40 h incubation with a yield factor 0.51. using these system 10 tonnes of agricultural wastes could be converted to 3.4 x 107 g of ethanol.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from bacillus sp. v230.
AB  == the beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from bacillus sp. v230 has been cloned in  escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. the product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion  and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. the a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the bacillus subtilis  levanscrase (63.7% identity), the streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).

TI  == the cis-diol dehydrogenase cbac gene of tn5271 is required for growth on 3-chlorobenzoate but not 3,4-dichlorobenzoate.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of cbac, the 1-carboxy-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,6-diene (cis-diol) dehydrogenase gene from the 3-chlorobenzoate (3-cba) catabolic transposon tn5271 was determined. the functional significance of the deduced open reading frame was evaluated by deletion of an internal bsteii restriction site in cbac and by the creation of nested deletions using exonuclease iii. expression studies were carried out with  alcaligenes sp. strain br6024, a chloramphenicol-resistant, tryptophan auxotroph  derived from the wild-type isolate br60. br6024 hosts carrying complete cbaab (3-cba 3,4-(4,5)-dioxygenase and reductase) genes, with deletions of cbac, metabolized 3cba to the cis-4,5-diol metabolite. these mutants failed to grow on  3-cba; however, they grew on 3,4-dichlorobenzoate, accumulating 5-chloroprotocatechuate transiently. these results indicated the cbac dehydrogenase was not required for re-aromatization of the unstable 3,4-dcba cis-4,5-diol metabolite. spontaneous elimination of hcl from this metabolite is proposed to generate 5-chloroprotocatechuate, which is a substrate for the protocatechuate metaring fission pathway in alcaligenes sp. br60. the relationship of the deduced amino acid sequence of cbac with 15 other oxidoreductases and sequences of unknown function from bacteria, plants and animals revealed a conserved n-terminal gxxgxg dinucleotide-binding domain and a  conserved region with a h(x11)khvlxekpxa consensus flanked by alpha-helical domains. o-phthalate cis-diol dehydrogenase (pseudomonas putida), glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (zymomonas mobilis), myo-inositol-2-dehydrogenase (bacillus subtilis) and d-galactose-1-dehydrogenase (pseudomonas fluorescens) are related proteins. these dehydrogenases are unrelated to the type i, ii and iii dehydrogenase superfamilies that include the cis-diol dehydrogenases involved in  benzoate, toluene, biphenyl and naphthalene catabolism (type ii) and benzene catabolism (type iii).

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1.
AB  == methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. the rectangular views can  be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. it is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. the estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. the enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, and escherichia coli,  which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. in view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (ec 1.1.1.1) by using the name nad-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
