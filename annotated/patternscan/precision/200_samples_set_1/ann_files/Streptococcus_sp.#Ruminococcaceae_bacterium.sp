TI  == the bamboo-eating giant panda harbors a carnivore-like gut microbiota, with excessive seasonal variations.
AB  == the giant panda evolved from omnivorous bears. it lives on a bamboo-dominated diet at present, but it still retains a typical carnivorous digestive system and  is genetically deficient in cellulose-digesting enzymes. to find out whether this endangered mammalian species, like other herbivores, has successfully developed a gut microbiota adapted to its fiber-rich diet, we conducted a 16s rrna gene-based large-scale structural profiling of the giant panda fecal microbiota. forty-five  captive individuals were sampled in spring, summer, and late autumn within 1 year. significant intraindividual variations in the diversity and structure of gut microbiota across seasons were observed in this population, which were even greater than the variations between individuals. compared with published data sets involving 124 gut microbiota profiles from 54 mammalian species, these giant pandas, together with 9 captive and 7 wild individuals investigated previously, showed extremely low gut microbiota diversity and an overall structure that diverged from those of nonpanda herbivores but converged with those of carnivorous and omnivorous bears. the giant panda did not harbor putative cellulose-degrading phylotypes such as ruminococcaceae and bacteroides bacteria that are typically enriched in other herbivores, but instead, its microbiota was  dominated by escherichia/shigella and streptococcus bacteria. members of the class clostridia were common and abundant in the giant panda gut microbiota, but  most of the members present were absent in other herbivores and were not phylogenetically related with known cellulolytic lineages. therefore, the giant panda appears not to have evolved a gut microbiota compatible with its newly adopted diet, which may adversely influence the coevolutionary fitness of this herbivore. importance: the giant panda, an endangered mammalian species endemic to western china, is well known for its unique bamboo diet. unlike other herbivores that have successfully evolved anatomically specialized digestive systems to efficiently deconstruct fibrous plant matter, the giant panda still retains a gastrointestinal tract typical of carnivores. we characterized the fecal bacterial communities from a giant panda population to determine whether this animal relies on its symbiotic gut microbiota to cope with the complex carbohydrates that dominate its diet, as is common in other herbivores. we found  that the giant panda gut microbiota is low in diversity and highly variable across seasons. it also shows an overall composition typical of bears and entirely differentiated from other herbivores, with low levels of putative cellulose-digesting bacteria. the gut microbiota of this herbivore, therefore, may not have well adapted to its highly fibrous diet, suggesting a potential link with its poor digestive efficiency.

TI  == shedding light on the microbial community of the macropod foregut using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing.
AB  == twenty macropods from five locations in queensland, australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. specifically, the v3/v4 region of 16s rrna gene was examined. a total of 5040 otus were identified in the data set (post filtering). thirty-two otus were identified as 'shared' otus (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either firmicutes or bacteroidetes (clostridiales/bacteroidales). these phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. genera represented within the shared otus included: unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified lachnospiraceae, unclassified clostridiales, peptococcus sp. coprococcus spp., streptococcus spp., blautia sp., ruminoccocus sp., eubacterium sp., dorea sp., oscillospira sp. and butyrivibrio sp. the composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (macropus rufus, macropus giganteus and macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. specifically, eleven dominant otus that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified  ruminococcaceae, unclassified bacteroidales, prevotella spp. and a syntrophococcus sucromutans. putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in  cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry.

TI  == pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes in fecal samples reveals high diversity of hindgut microflora in horses and potential links to chronic laminitis.
AB  == background: the nutrition and health of horses is closely tied to their gastrointestinal microflora. gut bacteria break down plant structural carbohydrates and produce volatile fatty acids, which are a major source of energy for horses. bacterial communities are also essential for maintaining gut homeostasis and have been hypothesized to contribute to various diseases including laminitis. we performed pyrosequencing of 16s rrna bacterial genes isolated from fecal material to characterize hindgut bacterial communities in healthy horses and those with chronic laminitis. results: fecal samples were collected from 10 normal horses and 8 horses with chronic laminitis. genomic dna  was extracted and the v4-v5 segment of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced on the 454 platform generating a mean of 2,425 reads per sample after quality trimming. the bacterial communities were dominated by firmicutes (69.21%  control, 56.72% laminitis) and verrucomicrobia (18.13% control, 27.63% laminitis), followed by bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, and spirochaetes. we observed more otus per individual in the laminitis group than the control group (419.6 and 355.2, respectively, p = 0.019) along with a difference in the abundance of two unassigned clostridiales genera (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01). the most abundant bacteria were streptococcus spp., clostridium spp., and treponema spp.; along with unassigned genera from subdivision 5 of verrucomicrobia, ruminococcaceae, and clostridiaceae, which together constituted ~ 80% of all otus. there was a high level of individual variation across all taxonomic ranks.  conclusions: our exploration of the equine fecal microflora revealed higher bacterial diversity in horses with chronic laminitis and identification of two clostridiales genera that differed in abundance from control horses. there was large individual variation in bacterial communities that was not explained in our study. the core hindgut microflora was dominated by streptococcus spp., several cellulytic genera, and a large proportion of uncharacterized otus that warrant further investigation regarding their function. our data provide a foundation for future investigations of hindgut bacterial factors that may influence the development and progression of chronic laminitis.

TI  == alterations in microbiota and fermentation products in equine large intestine in  response to dietary variation and intestinal disease.
AB  == we aimed to determine the effects of variations in dietary composition on equine  gut microbiota and their fermentation products, and proposed that dietary modifications profoundly affect microbial ecosystems and their metabolites. bacterial communities within the large intestine of three groups of horses were compared using oligonucleotide-rna hybridisation methodology. each group consisting of six horses was maintained on (1) a grass-only diet, (2) a concentrate diet (i.e. supplemented with hydrolysable carbohydrates) and (3) a concentrate diet but horses were affected by simple colonic obstruction and distension (scod), a prevalent form of dietary-induced intestinal disease. we show that in response to dietary change and intestinal disease, there is a progressive and significant increase in lachnospiraceae, the bacteroidetes assemblage and the lactic acid-producing, bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus (bls) group. in contrast, there is a corresponding decrease in the proportion of  obligate fibrolytic, acid-intolerant bacteria, fibrobacter and ruminococcaceae. assessment of monocarboxylic acids indicated that there are significantly higher  concentrations of lactic acid in the colonic contents of horses maintained on a concentrate diet and those suffering from scod, correlating with the observed increase in the population abundance of the bls group. however, the population size of the veillonellaceae (lactate utilisers) remained constant in each study group. the inability of this group to respond to increased lactic acid may be a contributory factor to the build-up of lactic acid observed in horses fed a concentrate diet and those suffering from scod.
