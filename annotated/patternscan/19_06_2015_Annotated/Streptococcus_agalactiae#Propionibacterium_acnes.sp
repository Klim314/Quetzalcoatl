TI  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol beta-d-glucuronide, precursor of 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol in human sweat.
AB  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol (alpha-androstenol) is an important contributor to human axilla sweat odor. it is assumed that alpha-andostenol is excreted from the apocrine glands via a h2 o-soluble conjugate, and this precursor was formally characterized in this study for the first time in human sweat. the possible h2 o-soluble precursors, sulfate and glucuronide derivatives, were synthesized as analytical standards, i.e., alpha-androstenol, beta-androstenol sulfates, 5alpha-androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol (beta-androstadienol) sulfate, alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide, alpha-androstenol alpha-glucuronide, beta-androstadienol beta-glucuronide, and alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide furanose. the occurrence of alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide was established by ultra performance liquid chromatography (uplc)/ms (heated electrospray ionization (hesi)) in negative-ion mode in pooled human sweat, containing eccrine and apocrine secretions and collected from 25 female and 24 male underarms. its concentration was of 79 ng/ml in female secretions and 241 ng/ml in male secretions. the release of alpha-androstenol was observed after incubation of the sterile human sweat or alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide with a commercial glucuronidase enzyme, the urine-isolated bacteria streptococcus agalactiae, and the skin bacteria staphylococcus warneri dsm 20316, staphylococcus haemolyticus dsm 20263, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919, reported to have beta-glucuronidase activities. we demonstrated that if alpha- and beta-androstenols and androstadienol sulfates were present in human sweat, their  concentrations would be too low to be considered as potential precursors of malodors; therefore, the h2 o-soluble precursor of alpha-androstenol in apocrine  secretion should be a beta-glucuronide.

TI  == purulent pericarditis: report of 2 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == purulent pericarditis, a localized infection within the pericardial space, has become a rare entity in the modern antibiotic era. although historically a disease of children and young adults, this is no longer the case: the median age  at the time of diagnosis has increased by nearly 30 years over the past 6 decades. despite advances in diagnostic and treatment modalities, purulent pericarditis remains a life-threatening illness. unfortunately, the diagnosis is  made postmortem in more than half the cases. thus, a high index of clinical suspicion is crucial. we present 2 cases of purulent pericarditis, and provide an updated review of other case series published over the past 60 years.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == camp factor homologues in propionibacterium acnes: a new protein family differentially expressed by types i and ii.
AB  == analysis of the draft genome sequence of the opportunistic pathogen propionibacterium acnes type strain nctc 737 (=atcc 6919) revealed five genes with sequence identity to the co-haemolytic christie-atkins-munch-peterson (camp) factor of streptococcus agalactiae. the predicted molecular masses for the expressed proteins ranged from 28 to 30 kda. the genes were present in each of the three recently identified reca-based phylogenetic groupings of p. acnes (ia,  ib and ii), as assessed by pcr amplification. conserved differences in camp factor gene sequences between these three groups were also consistent with their  previous phylogenetic designations. all type ia, ib and ii isolates were positive for the co-haemolytic reaction on sheep blood agar. immunoblotting and silver staining of sds-page gels, however, revealed differential protein expression of camp factors amongst the different groups. type ib and ii isolates produced an abundance of camp factor 1, detectable by specific antibody labelling and silver  staining of sds-page gels. in contrast, abundant camp factor production was lacking in type ia isolates, although larger amounts of camp factor 2 were detectable by immunoblotting compared with type ii isolates. while the potential  role of the abundant camp factor 1 in host colonization or virulence remains to be determined, it should be noted that the type strain of p. acnes used in much of the published literature is a type ia isolate and is, therefore, lacking in this attribute.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == the hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. the gene was isolated on an ecori-generated 3-kb piece of dna. expression was less in escherichia coli than in p. acnes; in e. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. the gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kda. amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. the leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. the amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from  streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus. a  potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.

TI  == evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of minocycline (mino) and that of cefuzonam (czon) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. mino was highly active against methicilli-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, flavobacterium meningosepticum, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, peptostreptococcus spp. and propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. czon was highly active against mssa, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, n. gonorrhoeae, m(b). catarrhalis, h. influenzae, h. pylori, p. mirabilis, peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes, but not effective against mrsa. it was minimally active against gram-negative rods (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.

TI  == electron capture gas-liquid chromatographic study of metabolites produced by some arthritic transudate-associated organisms in vitro and in vivo in rabbit models.
AB  == computerized, frequency-pulsed, modulated electron capture gas-liquid chromatography was used to study the acid metabolites produced in vitro in fetal  calf serum and in vivo in an animal chamber model. several strains of diplostreptococcus agalactiae, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus serogroups a, b, and g were studied. all of these organisms have been reported to be associated with arthritic transudates in humans. metabolites were detected by this method from derivatized extracts of both spent  fetal calf serum and chamber fluids. since there was little host response to the  organisms cultured in the chambers, it is highly probable that the products detected represent metabolites produced in an in vivo type of environment. the metabolic patterns were reproducible and exhibited many similarities in vitro and in vivo. production of the acids detected was reproducible, and these acids were  useful identification markers. the data support published reports (j. b. brooks,  c. c. alley, and j. a. liddle, anal. chem. 46: 1930-1934, 1974; j. b. brooks, g.  choudhary, r. b. craven, d. edman, c. c. alley, and j. a. liddle, j. clin. microbiol. 5:625-628, 1977; j. b. brooks, r. b. craven, a. r. melton, and c. c. alley, in h. h. johnson and w. b. newson, ed., second international symposium on  rapid methods and automation on microbiology, 1976; j. b. brooks, r. b. craven, d. schlossberg, c. c. alley, and f. m. pitts, j. clin. microbiol. 8:203-208, 1978; j. b. brooks, d. s. kellogg, c. c. alley, h. b. short, and h. h. handsfield, j. infect. dis. 129:660-668, 1974) that bacterial metabolites might be detectable in diseased body fluids. the growth characteristics of the organisms in the animal model and fetal calf serum are discussed, and a moderately priced computer for performing data manipulations is evaluated.

TI  == synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by staphylococcus aureus or clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of propionibacterium acnes. p. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase c-precipitated egg yolk agar. such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. similar reactions were attempted with lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. the synergistic reactions, between p. acnes and c. perfringens, were compared with the classical  camp reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. synergistic reactions observed do seem  to reflect the membrane composition. such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria,  may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.
