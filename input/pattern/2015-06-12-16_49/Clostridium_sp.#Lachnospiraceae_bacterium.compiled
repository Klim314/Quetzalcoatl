TI  - Murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family Lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  - Three strains of an anaerobic, Gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. These strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family Lachnospiraceae (<94 %). The most closely related species with names that have standing in nomenclature were Robinsoniella peoriensis, Ruminococcus gnavus, Blautia producta and Clostridium xylanolyticum. Phylogenetic relationships based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60 genes. The use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for Ruminococcus gnavus and B. producta. All three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by C16 : 0 methyl ester. Differences in the proportions of C12 : 0 methyl ester, C14 : 0 methyl ester and C18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically neighbouring species. The major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain SRB-530-5-H(T) was acetic acid. This strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species Robinsoniella peoriensis. The isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. Based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species Murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains SRB-530-5-H(T) ( = DSM 26524(T) = CCUG 63391(T)) (the type strain of Murimonas intestini), SRB-509-4-S-H ( = DSM 27577 = CCUG 64595) and SRB-524-4-S-H ( = DSM 27578 = CCUG 64594).
TI  - Mobilitalea sibirica gen. nov., sp. nov., a halotolerant polysaccharide-degrading bacterium.
AB  - A novel strictly anaerobic, halotolerant, organotrophic bacterium, strain P3M-3(T), was isolated from a microbial mat formed under the flow of hot water emerging from a 2775 m-deep well in Tomsk region (western Siberia, Russia). Cells of strain P3M-3(T) were straight and curved rods, 0.2-0.4 microm in width and 1.5-20 microm in length. Strain P3M-3(T) grew optimally at 37 degrees C, pH 7.0-7.5 and in a NaCl concentration of 15 g l(-1). Under optimum growth conditions, the doubling time was 1 h. The isolate was able to ferment a variety of mono-, di- and polysaccharides, including microcrystalline cellulose. Acetate, ethanol, H2 and CO2 were the main products of glucose fermentation. The DNA G+C content was 33.4 mol%. 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain P3M-3(T) was a member of family Lachnospiraceae, whose representatives are also found in Clostridium cluster XIVa. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Clostridium jejuense HY-35-12(T), the closest relative, was 93.9%. A novel genus and species, Mobilitalea sibirica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed based on phylogenetic analysis and physiological properties of the novel isolate. The type strain of the type species is P3M-3(T) ( = DSM 26468(T) = VKM B-2804(T)).
TI  - [Effect of electroacupuncture intervention on enteric microecology in ulcerative  colitis rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on enteric microbial  populations in ulcerative colitis (UC) model rats, so as to study its mechanisms underlying improving UC. METHODS: Thirty-nine male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and EA group (n = 13 in each group). The UC model was established by intragstric perfusion of 4% dextran sodiumaqueous solution (DSS), once daily for 7 days. EA (15-25 Hz, 0.1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Tianshu" (ST 25), "Zusanli" (ST 36) and "Shangjuxu" (ST 37) for 10 min, once daily for 5 days. Disease Activity Index (DAI) including body weight and stool blood state was used to evaluate the animals' conditions. The rats' excrement was collected to detect the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the animals' DAI score and enteric Clostridium bifermentans content were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations, and contents of enteric Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Lactobacillus sp. were considerably down-regulated in the model group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the DAI score and enteric Clostridium bifermentans content were significantly lowered, and the abundance and diversity of bacterial populations, and contents of enteric Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Lactobacillus sp. were notably increased in the EA group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: EA can improve DAI and the abundance and diversity of enteric bacterial microbiota in UC rats, which may be related to its protective effect on enteric microecology in UC.
TI  - Eisenbergiella tayi gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human blood.
AB  - A catalase-positive, rod-shaped, non-proteolytic, non-motile, anaerobic bacterial strain, designated B086562(T), was isolated from a blood culture of an 84-year-old male patient in Israel. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, this strain has no known close relatives among recognized bacteria but should be placed within the family Lachnospiraceae. The most closely related recognized bacteria were from the 'Clostridium clostridioforme group': C. clostridioforme (92.4%) and Clostridium bolteae (92.3%). The isolate produced butyrate, lactate, acetate and succinate as major metabolic end products. The major fatty acids were C16:0 and C18:1 cis 9 DMA and the DNA G+C content was 46.0 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, the blood isolate represents a novel species of a new genus in the family Lachnospiraceae, for which the name Eisenbergiella tayi gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Eisenbergiella tayi is B086562(T) ( = LMG 27400(T) = DSM 26961(T) = ATCC BAA-2558(T)).
TI  - Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  - Three Gram-stain-positive, obligately anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, spindle-shaped bacterial strains (HT03-11(T), KO-38 and TT-111), isolated from human faeces were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the strains were highly related to each other genetically (displaying >99 % sequence similarity) and represented a previously unknown subline within the Blautia coccoides rRNA group of organisms (cluster XIVa). The closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain HT03-11(T) were Clostridium bolteae WAL 16351(T) (93.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1(T) (93.7 % similarity). All isolates produced lactic acid, formic acid, acetic acid and succinic acid as fermentation end products from glucose. Their chemotaxonomic properties included lysine as the cell wall diamino acid and C16 : 0, C18 : 1omega7c DMA and C16 : 0 DMA as the major fatty acids. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA were 46.9-47.2 mol% (HPLC). Several phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics could be readily used to differentiate the isolates from phylogenetically related clostridia. Therefore, strains HT03-11(T), KO-38 and TT-111 represent a novel species in a new genus of the family Lachnospiraceae, for which the name Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is HT03-11(T) ( = YIT 12554(T) = JCM 18507(T) = DSM 26062(T)).
TI  - Acetatifactor muris gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the intestine of an obese mouse.
AB  - We used selective agar media for culturing bacteria from the caecum of mice fed a high calorie diet. In addition to the isolation of Enterobacteriaceae growing on a medium containing cholesterol and bile salts, we focused on the characterization of strain CT-m2(T), which, based on 16S rDNA analysis, did not appear to correspond to any currently described organisms. The isolate belongs to the Clostridium cluster XIV and is most closely related to members of the Lachnospiraceae, including the genera Anaerostipes, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, Robinsoniella, Roseburia, Ruminococcus and Syntrophococcus (</=90 % similarity). Strain CT-m2(T) is a non-motile Gram-positive rod that does not form spores and has a G + C content of DNA of 48.5 %. Cells grow under strictly anoxic conditions (100 % N(2)) and produce acetate and butyrate after growth in reduced WCA broth. In contrast to related species, the new bacterium does not metabolize glucose and is positive for phenylalanine arylamidase, and its major cellular fatty acid is C(1)(4):(0). Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic studies, the isolate merits recognition as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the name Acetatifactor muris is proposed. The type strain is CT-m2(T) (= DSM 23669(T) = ATCC BAA-2170(T)).
TI  - Dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of Gayals (Bos frontalis), Yaks (Bos  grunniens) and Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The dominant rumen bacteria in Gayals, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle were investigated using PCR-DGGE approach. The analysis of DGGE profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16S rDNA sequences in DGGE profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. DGGE profiles revealed that Gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. A total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that Gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen dominant bacteria of Gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the genera Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium celerecrescens. Moreover, the dominant bacteria of Yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Schwartzia succinivorans and Clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. In addition, the dominant bacteria in Yunnan Yellow Cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing Prevotella sp., Staphylococci lentus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Corynebacterium casei. Present study first detected Staphylococcus lentus and Staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Cellulosilyticum ruminicola gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the rumen of yak,  and reclassification of Clostridium lentocellum as Cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov.
AB  - An obligate anaerobic, Gram-staining-negative, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium, strain H1(T), was isolated from the rumen content of yak. Cells were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.8-1.0 x 3.0-4.0 microm in size, non-motile and encapsulated with mucous materials. Elliptical and terminal spores that swelled the cells were produced occasionally. The strain grew at 25-45 degrees C (optimum, 38 degrees C) and pH 6.0-7.8 (optimum, pH 6.7). Cellulose, cellobiose, xylan, xylose and maltose were used as carbon and energy sources, but not glucose. Products from cellulose and cellobiose fermentation were formic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide and trace amounts of ethanol, lactic acid and succinic acid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 33.7+/-1.2 mol%. The predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (27.1 %), C(14 : 0) (9.2 %) and iso-C( 16 : 0) (6.4%). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain H1(T) was affiliated to the clostridial rRNA cluster XIVb and showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Clostridium lentocellum DSM 5427(T) (96.0 %). These two strains formed a distinct lineage of the family 'Lachnospiraceae '. Based on data from this polyphasic taxonomic study, a new genus, Cellulosilyticum gen. nov., is proposed. Cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is proposed for strain H1(T). The type strain of Cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is strain H1(T) (=CGMCC 1.5065(T)=JCM 14822(T)). Clostridium lentocellum was reclassified in the new genus as Cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov. (type strain RHM5(T)=ATCC 49066( T)=DSM 5427(T)=NCIMB 11756(T)).
