TI  == effects of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the effects of difructose anhydride iii (di-d-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; dfa iii) administration (3% dfa iii for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to dgge profiles, the number of bacteria related to bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis and ruminococcus productus increased  in dfa iii-fed rat cecum. in the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats, a lowering of ph and an increase in short chain fatty acids (scfas), especially acetic acid, were observed. the dfa iii-assimilating bacterium, ruminococcus sp. m-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats. the strain had 98% similarity with r. productus atcc 27340t (l76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. these results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by dfa iii administration. moreover, dfa iii stimulated the growth of ruminococcus sp. m-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. it is expected that dfa iii would be  a new candidate as a prebiotic.

TI  == bacteroides infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1990, 336 bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. they comprised 180 (54%) b. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) b. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) b. vulgatus, 34 (10%) b. distasonis, 21 (6%) b. ovatus and 10 (3%) b. uniformis. infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. most bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). predisposing conditions were present  in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy  (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body  (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). the micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), escherichia coli (122), fusobacterium spp. (38) and clostridium spp. (30). all patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. all but 12 (5%) patients recovered. these data illustrate the importance of bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
