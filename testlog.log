('>F', 'TI  - Determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques.', 'AB  - The human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. Antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. Azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. It is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. The use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. In this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of Sprague Dawley rats and the role of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. PCR with universal primers targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene followed by DGGE was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota composition. Cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative PCR with group-specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. We found that the total amount of 16S rRNA gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. The results from PCR with group-specific primers showed that Bacteroides sp was present in the control and probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. Moreover, semi-quantitative PCR revealed that the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while Bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group (P < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. Azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. The present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly L. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance.')

In this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pNZ8048 to express the mCherry protein (pRCR) to expand the usage of the mCherry protein for analysis of gene expression in Lactobacillus. This vector is also able to replicate in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The usage of pRCR as a promoter probe was validated in Lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin B expression.

('>F', 'TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from Guatemalan medicinal plants.', 'AB  - CONTEXT: Essential oils are prevalent in many medicinal plants used for oral hygiene and treatment of diseases. OBJECTIVE: Medicinal plant species were extracted to determine the essential oil content. Those producing sufficient oil were screened for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant samples were collected, frozen, and essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using a tube dilution assay for those species yielding sufficient oil. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 141 plant species produced sufficient oil for collection and 12 species not previously reported to produce essential oils were identified. Essential oil extracts from 32 species exhibited activity against one or more microbes. Oils from eight species were highly inhibitory to S. mutans, four species were highly inhibitory to C. albicans, and 19 species yielded MIC values less than the reference drugs. DISCUSSION: RESULTS suggest that 11 species were highly inhibitory to the microbes tested and merit further investigation. Oils from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae), Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle (Rutaceae), Lippia graveolens Kunth (Verbenaceae), and Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae) yielded highly significant or moderate activity against all microbes and have potential as antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Teas prepared by decoction or infusion are known methods for extracting essential oils. Oils from 11 species were highly active against the microbes tested and merit investigation as to their potential for addressing health-related issues and in oral hygiene.')

The effects of dietary CJP on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. A total of 240 one-day-old Ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g CJP/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. Dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg CJP significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg CJP, whereas the IgG and IgA concentration remained unaffected. In addition, 20 g/kg CJP significantly inhibited proliferation of Escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of Lactobacillus or Bacillus spp. 5. A significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary CJP. 6. Thus, the results suggest that CJP up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal E. coli and TBARS values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.')

Cattle within replicates were stratified by initial levels of E. coli O157:H7 and randomized to experimental groups, with 30 pens allocated on June 15, 2011 (AS1), 18 pens allocated on June 28, 2011 (AS2), and 18 cattle per pen. Rectal fecal samples and perineal swabs were collected at 28-day intervals until shipment to slaughter (103-145 days on trial). Numbers of cattle with enumerable E. coli O157:H7 (>/=1.6 CFU/g feces) were reduced in AS1 and AS2 by VAC (p=0.008), although interventions had no impact on numbers of E. coli O157:H7 shed. For AS1, VAC reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.04) in the feeding period but not at shipment to slaughter. For AS2, prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 was not reduced in either feces or perineal swabs by VAC at any time. For AS1, DFM reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in perineal swabs (p=0.01) during the feeding period. For AS2, DFM increased E. coli O157:H7 detection in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.01) at shipment to slaughter. Seventy-five percent of AS1 E. coli O157:H7 isolates had only stx1, while 87% of AS2 isolates had stx1 and stx2 genes. Of the two interventions, VAC shows the most potential for pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7, but due to variable efficacy of both DFM and VAC, additional product development is necessary to ensure more consistent pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7.')

Our objectives were to determine fecal prevalence and characteristics of E. coli O26 in commercial feedlot cattle (17,148) that were enrolled in a study to evaluate an E. coli O157:H7 siderophore receptor and porin (SRP((R))) vaccine (VAC) and a direct-fed microbial (DFM; 10(6) colony-forming units [CFU]/animal/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(9) CFU/animal/day of Propionibacterium freudenreichii). Cattle were randomly allocated to 40 pens within 10 complete blocks; pens were randomly assigned to control, VAC, DFM, or VAC+DFM treatments. Vaccine was administered on days 0 and 21, and DFM was fed throughout the study. Pen-floor fecal samples (30/pen) were collected weekly for the last 4 study weeks. Samples were enriched in E. coli broth and subjected to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to detect O26-specific wzx gene and four major virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae, and ehxA) and to a culture-based procedure that involved immunomagnetic separation and plating on MacConkey agar. Ten presumptive E. coli colonies were randomly picked, pooled, and tested by the multiplex PCR. Pooled colonies positive for O26 serogroup were streaked on sorbose MacConkey agar, and 10 randomly picked colonies per sample were tested individually by the multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of E. coli O26 was higher (p<0.001) by the culture-based method compared to the PCR assay (22.7 versus 10.5%). The interventions (VAC and or DFM) had no impact on fecal shedding of O26. Serogroup O26 was recovered in pure culture from 23.9% (260 of 1089) of O26 PCR-positive pooled colonies. Only 7 of the 260 isolates were positive for the stx gene and 90.1% of the isolates possessed an eaebeta gene that codes for intimin subtype beta, but not the bfpA gene, which codes for bundle-forming pilus. Therefore, the majority of the O26 recovered from feedlot cattle feces was atypical enteropathogenic E. coli, and not STEC.')

METHODS AND RESULTS: Pure Ara h 1 heated at three different temperature conditions (G37, G60 and C145 degrees C) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Impacts of Ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to Caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: DAPI, LIVE/DEAD staining and FISH. Examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of E. coli and Ent. faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival. Maillard reaction (MR, glycation) of Ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate. Hydrolysates modified at 60 and 145 degrees C with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering E. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of Ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees C, together with modulation of immobilization of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.')

Bean and soy tempeh were culinarily processed and next digested in conditions simulating the human digestive tract (one of the digestive tracts was equipped with a mechanism simulating absorption). Soy tempeh stimulated most the growth of bacteria of the genus Bifidobacterium, while bean tempeh that of Escherichia coli.

The subjects largely consumed their habitual diet, but had to abstain from consuming dairy foods generally high in Ca. The subjects were randomised into the L. acidophilus (dose 10(9) colony-forming units twice daily; n 20) or the placebo (n 19) group. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks, the subjects were orally infected with a live, but attenuated, ETEC vaccine, able to induce mild, short-lived symptoms. Before and after the challenge, the subjects recorded stool consistency, bowel habits, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. The ETEC challenge led to a significant increase in faecal output on the 2nd day and a concomitant increase in Bristol stool scale scores. Likewise, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, fever, headache and nausea peaked 1 d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of faecal calprotectin and IgA peaked 2 d after and that of serum IgM peaked 9 and 15 d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of serum IgA and IgG were unaffected. The ETEC challenge led to a reduction in the number of Bacteroides-Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVab and total faecal bacteria. Probiotic treatment was associated with a larger increase in Bristol stool scale scores and more fever, headache and nausea after the ETEC challenge compared with the placebo treatment. These differences were, however, small and with substantial variation within the groups. Oral application of an attenuated live ETEC vaccine provides a useful model for food-borne infections. Supplementation with L. acidophilus ATCC 700396, however, was ineffective in reducing ETEC infection symptoms in healthy men.')

('>F', 'TI - Secreted aspartic peptidases of Candida albicans liberate bactericidal hemocidins from human hemoglobin.', "AB  - Secreted aspartic peptidases (Saps) are a group of ten acidic hydrolases considered as key virulence factors of Candida albicans. These enzymes supply the fungus with nutrient amino acids as well as are able to degrade the selected host's proteins involved in the immune defense. Our previous studies showed that the human menstrual discharge is exceptionally rich in bactericidal hemoglobin (Hb) fragments - hemocidins. However, to date, the genesis of such peptides is unclear. The presented study demonstrates that the action of C. albicans isozymes Sap1-Sap6, Sap8 and Sap9, but not Sap7 and Sap10, toward human hemoglobin leads to limited proteolysis of this protein and generates a variety of antimicrobial hemocidins. We have identified these peptides and checked their activity against selected microorganisms representative for human vagina. We have also demonstrated that the process of Hb hydrolysis is most effective at pH 4.0, characteristic for vagina, and the liberated peptides showed pronounced killing activity toward Lactobacillus acidophilus, and to a lower degree, Escherichia coli. However, only a very weak activity toward Staphylococcus aureus and C. albicans was noticed. These findings provide interesting new insights into pathophysiology of human vaginal candidiasis and suggest that C. albicans may be able to compete with the other microorganisms of the same physiological niche using the microbicidal peptides generated from the host protein.")

('>F', 'TI  - Impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.', 'AB  - Male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. This is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. In mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. In male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. The sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. In this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. Six different intestinal bacteria, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium bifermentans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. For each bacterium, 50 microL of semen was diluted in 450 microL of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. The experiment was repeated twice. In each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. Also, the pH was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. The results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (P < 0.0001), but broths containing Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. Although broth containing Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. Broths containing E. coli, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. However, pH was increased when semen was exposed to the E. coli and Campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus treatments, pH was reduced. In conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.')

Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth.

('>F', 'TI  - Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.', 'AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. Previous observations have shown that CNTs have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of CNTs to human gut microbes has not been investigated. Here, the antibacterial activity of CNTs against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--L. acidophilus, B. adolescentis, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus--are evaluated. The bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. In this study, CNTs, including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, 1-3 mum), short and long multi-walled CNTs (s-MWCNTs: 0.5-2 mum; l-MWCNTs: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled CNTs (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. Notably, CNTs may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of CNTs, but also the shapes of the bacteria. The mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components DNA and RNA and allowing a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. Thin and rigid SWCNT show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than MWCNTs. Long MWCNT may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. This work suggests that CNTs may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of CNTs could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic bacteria.')

Birds in the control group were fed the basal diet, whereas those in the experimental groups were fed diets supplemented with NCLI at 2% (NCLI group) or MCLI at 2% (MCLI group) for 42 d. The results showed that compared with the control, supplementation with NCLI or MCLI had no significant (P > 0.05) effects on productive parameters from d 1 to 42. Supplementation with MCLI and NCLI was associated with greater (P < 0.05) villus height in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those areas in the controls from d 1 to 42. However, supplementation with NCLI and MCLI had no significant (P > 0.05) influence on the crypt depth in the jejunal and ileal mucosa compared with those in the controls. Total viable counts of Escherichia coli were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased by MCLI and NCLI from d 1 to 21. The NCLI and MCLI significantly increased the total viable counts of Lactobacillus acidophilus from d 22 to 42.

Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate.

Bacterial strains have disparate effects in stimulating the immune system. In dendritic cells, the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, whereas gram-positive Lactobacillus acidophilus induces a robust interferon (IFN)-beta response. The immune-modulating effects of astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts were examined in bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells that were stimulated with L. acidophilus or E. coli. IFN-beta and other cytokines were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR. Endocytosis of fluorescence-labeled dextran and L. acidophilus in the presence of elderberry fruit or astragalus root extract was evaluated in dendritic cells. Our results show that both extracts enhanced L. acidophilus-induced IFN-beta production and slightly decreased the proinflammatory response to E. coli. The enhanced IFN-beta production was associated with upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 and to a varying degree, the cytokines IL-12, IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Both extracts increased endocytosis in immature dendritic cells, and only slightly influenced the viability of the cells. In conclusion, astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts increase the IFN-beta inducing activity of L. acidophilus in dendritic cells, suggesting that they may exert antiviral and immune-enhancing activity.')

H2O2 containing metabolites were obtained by cultivating lactobacilli in mineral medium, the amount of H2O2 was determined by oxidation of TMB by peroxidase. Bactericidal effect of lactobacilli metabolites for test strains treated by corynebacteria metabolites was evaluated by seeding results. Results. Inhibitio by corynebacteria metabolites of S. aureus catalase activity by 30-40% and E. coli catalase activ ity by 40-70% was shown.

Fresh fecal samples (30/pen) from pen floors were collected weekly for four consecutive weeks (study days 52-77). Two concurrent culture procedures were used to enable estimates of E. coli O157:H7 shedding prevalence and prevalence of high shedders. From 4800 total samples, 1522 (31.7%) were positive for E. coli O157:H7 and 169 (3.5%) were considered high shedders. Pen-level linear mixed models were used for data analyses. There were no significant interactions among treatments and time of sampling. However, vaccinated pens had lower (P<0.01) overall prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 (model-adjusted mean +/- SEM=17.4 +/- 3.95%) and lower (P<0.01) prevalence of high shedders (0.95 +/- 0.26%) than unvaccinated pens (37.0 +/- 6.32% and 4.19 +/- 0.81%, respectively). There was no evidence of a DFM effect on either measure of E. coli O157:H7 shedding.

The antimicrobial activity of S. grandiflora flower PE against selected pathogens was evaluated using both in vitro and in situ methods. In vitro studies suggested that PE has inhibitory effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri 2a, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. The gram-positive organism S. aureus was the most sensitive organism to PE and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be 0.013 mg/mL where as the MIC of PE against V. cholerae was the highest (0.25 mg/mL). On the other hand PE showed growth promoting effect on the common probiotic bacterium L. acidophilus. The major finding was that S. grandiflora PE induced a significant biomass increase of L. acidophilus grown in liquid culture media. PE showed reduction of S. aureus growth in food (fish) during storage at 10 degrees C. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that rutin, a major flavonoid of the PE diminished in the culture medium MRS broth with the growth of L. acidophilus.')

The cause of inflammation is unclear, but germfree mouse studies have implicated commensal gut bacteria. We tested whether diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and inflammation are associated with anti-bacterial IgG. Blood from lean and obese healthy volunteers or obese patients with diabetes were analyzed by ELISA for IgG against extracts of potentially pathogenic and pro-biotic strains of Escherichia coli (LF-82 and Nissle), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and for circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). C57Bl/6 mice were fed low- or high-fat diets (10% or 60% kcal from fat) for 10 weeks and tested for anti-bacterial IgG, bodyweight, fasting glucose, and inflammation. Obese diabetic patients had significantly more IgG against extracts of E. coli LF-82 compared with lean controls, whereas IgG against extracts of the other bacteria was unchanged. Circulating TNFalpha was elevated and correlated with IgG against the LF-82 extract. Mice fed high-fat diets had increased fasting glucose levels, elevated TNFalpha and neutrophils, and significantly more IgG against the LF-82 extracts. Diabetes in obesity is characterized by increased IgG against specific bacterial antigens. Specific commensal bacteria may mediate inflammatory effects of high-fat diets.')

This can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Enteral nutrition (EN) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. A continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of EN patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus DUN-311, Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-02, Bifidobacterium lactis BL-01, Synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. A PEG tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. The synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (SSSM) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after PEG tube insertion. The synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on PEG tube surfaces, with suppression of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to PEG insertion. When synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to PEG insertion, colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Candida famata was also inhibited. Lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (SSSM). These results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on PEG tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.")

In this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the C-terminal region of S-layer protein SlpB of Lactobacillus crispatus K2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the C-terminal region (LcsB) of Lb. crispatus K2-4-3 SlpB had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains SA and CbsA of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lb. crispatus. To evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or beta-galactosidase (Gal) was fused to the N-terminus of the LcsB region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in Escherichia coli, respectively. After mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused GFP-LcsB and Gal-LcsB were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. In addition, the binding capacity could be improved by SDS pretreatment. Moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. Furthermore, when the fused DNA fragment of gfp:lcsB was inserted into the Lactococcus lactis expression vector pSec:Leiss:Nuc, the GFP could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisA promoter. Western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and SDS sensitivity analysis confirmed that the GFP was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of L. lactis with the aid of the LcsB anchor. CONCLUSION: The LcsB region can be used as a functional scaffold to target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.')

We tested D-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. The activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. When ingested together with sucrose or starch, D-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. D-Fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (P < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (Tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. Moreover, D-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) populations (P < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on Bifidobacterium spp. or Lactobacillus spp. At the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of Enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. D-Fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. Based on all this evidence, D-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.')

By the treatment of DCs with cocktails containing TLR agonists and proinflammatory cytokines, the cells increased the secretion of the Th1-promoting cytokine IL-12p70. Clinically used probiotics were tested for their IL-10- and IL-12p70-stimulating properties in immature DCs, and showed a dose-dependent change in the IL-10/IL-12p70 balance. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM() and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 showed a strong induction of IL-12p70, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 and Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 preferentially induced IL-10. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 induced both IL-10 and IL-12p70, whereas the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii induced low levels of cytokines. When combining these microorganisms with the Th1-promoting cocktails, E. coli Nissle 1917 and B. infantis 35624 were potent suppressors of IL-12p70 secretion in an IL-10-independent manner, indicating a suppressive effect on Th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells.

Effects of eight such factors viz. zinc sulphate, zinc carbonate, ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate, quercetin, gallic acid, phytic acid, and oxalic acid were, therefore, investigated on 24 H growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L1) and Lactobacillus plantarum (L2), two isolates of bifidobacteria (longum (L3) and bifidum (L4)) and a marketed consortium (L5) of eight probiotic cultures. MRS medium with marketed fructooligosaccharide as the only source of carbon was used for study of dose response curves. Quercetin and zinc sulphate showed significant positive effect for L1 and L5 (P < 0.01), whereas there was slight positive effect or no effect on growth of other probiotics. Phytic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect for L2 and a slight inhibitory effect on L3 and L4 whereas L5 were able to tolerate phytic acid. Oxalic acid had slight positive effect for L1 (P < 0.05) and L5 and no effect on growth of other probiotics (P > 0.05).

In a double-blinded, randomised fashion, forty-five males with type 2 diabetes, impaired or normal glucose tolerance were enrolled and allocated to a 4-week treatment course with either L. acidophilus NCFM or placebo. L. acidophilus was detected in stool samples by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR. Separated by the 4-week intervention period, two hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps were performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, the systemic inflammatory response was evaluated by subjecting the participants to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide injection (0.3 ng/kg) before and after the treatment course. L. acidophilus NCFM was detected in 75 % of the faecal samples after treatment with the probiotic bacterium. Insulin sensitivity was preserved among volunteers in the L. acidophilus NCFM group, whereas it decreased in the placebo group. Both baseline inflammatory markers and the systemic inflammatory response were, however, unaffected by the intervention. In conclusion, intake of L. acidophilus NCFM for 4 weeks preserved insulin sensitivity compared with placebo, but did not affect the systemic inflammatory response.')

Nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to HIV-1 infection under natural conditions. If similar conditions can be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against HIV-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-HIV-1 vaccines. We reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to HIV-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and commensal bacteria on HIV-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of HIV-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. We established the HIV-1 reporter monocytic cell line, THP-1/NL4-3luc, which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. In these cells, stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 by their ligands suppressed HIV-1 expression partly through type I interferon (IFN). Among the commensal bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Veillonella parvula and Neisseria mucosa suppressed HIV-1 expression, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella melaninogenica, P. bivia and Mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. The bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated TLR4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated TLR2. Neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 and IFN-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated HIV-1 suppression. Suppressive effects of E. coli, V. parvula and N. mucosa on HIV-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute HIV-1 infection. These findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating TLR4 potentially produce local environments resistant to HIV-1 infection.')

In an attempt to evaluate the usefulness of these essential oils as food preservatives, they were also tested on an extract made of fish, where clove and thyme essential oils were the most effective. Then, gelatin-chitosan-based edible films incorporated with clove essential oil were elaborated and their antimicrobial activity tested against six selected microorganisms: Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrefaciens, Photobacterium phosphoreum, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The clove-containing films inhibited all these microorganisms irrespectively of the film matrix or type of microorganism. In a further experiment, when the complex gelatin-chitosan film incorporating clove essential oil was applied to fish during chilled storage, the growth of microorganisms was drastically reduced in gram-negative bacteria, especially enterobacteria, while lactic acid bacteria remained practically constant for much of the storage period. The effect on the microorganisms during this period was in accordance with biochemical indexes of quality, indicating the viability of these films for fish preservation.')

('>F', 'TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus induces virus immune defence genes in murine dendritic  cells by a Toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism.', 'AB  - Lactobacilli are probiotics that, among other health-promoting effects, have been ascribed immunostimulating and virus-preventive properties. Certain Lactobacillus spp. have been shown to possess strong interleukin-12 (IL-12) -inducing properties. As IL-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type I interferons (IFNs), we hypothesized that the strong IL-12-inducing capacity of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) is caused by an up-regulation of IFN-beta, which subsequently induces IL-12 and the double-stranded RNA binding Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). The expression of the genes encoding IFN-beta, TLR-3, IL-12 and IL-10 in DCs upon stimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM was determined. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM induced a much stronger expression of Ifn-beta, Il-12 and Il-10 compared with the synthetic double-stranded RNA ligand Poly I:C, whereas the levels of expressed Tlr-3 were similar. Whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that other genes related to viral defence were significantly up-regulated and among the strongest induced genes in DCs stimulated with L. acidophilus NCFM. The ability to induce IFN-beta was also detected in another L. acidophilus strain (X37), but was not a property of other probiotic strains tested, i.e. Bifidobacterium bifidum Z9 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. The IFN-beta expression was markedly reduced in TLR-2(-/-) DCs, dependent on endocytosis, and the major cause of the induction of Il-12 and Tlr-3 in DCs stimulated with L. acidophilus NCFM.

METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis.

In the present study, the characterization of the coaggregation ability of 19 vaginal lactobacilli was studied. Coaggregation ability of all lactobacilli with Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 was positive. Only the highest coaggregation percentage of Lactobacillus acidophilus S1 was obtained with E. coli ATCC 11229 under both aerobic (71%) and anaerobic conditions (62%). The coaggregation abilities of strains occurred higher at acidic pH than at basic pH values. Moreover, the coaggregation abilities of tested strains against E. coli decreased after heat treatment (70 or 85 degrees C). Also, the relationship between hydrophobicity and coaggregation of strains was found to be significant. The effect of sonication, some enzymes (lipase and pepsin) and sodium periodate on coaggregation ability of L. acidophilus S1, which is one of the highest potentials on coaggregation ability, was investigated. Sodium periodate did not have a significant effect on coaggregation ability of L. acidophilus S1. The sonicated cell showed lower coaggregation than the control, the supernatant fluid of this sonicated cells showed similar coaggregation ability to the control.

Bacterial maturation of DC occurred independently of tissue origin. Expression of CCR7 and CD103 on the surface of MLN DC, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory T cells, increased with stimulation by Gram-positive commensals. Bacteria-dependent cytokine production (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) was similar in spleen and MLN DC, and contaminant cells in these DC preparations produced IFN-gamma in response to L. acidophilus. In contrast, PP DC produced IL-6 only in response to E. coli, little IL-10 and no TNF-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by IL-10 or TGF-beta. Bifidobacteria downregulate IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-12 production induced in in vitro-generated DC by L. acidophilus. Similar inhibition was observed in splenic DC, but not in MLN DC. MLN cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher IFN-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. Commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.")

Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.')

('?F#AMBIGUOUS', 'TI  - Pre-harvest interventions to reduce the shedding of E. coli O157 in the faeces of weaned domestic ruminants: a systematic review.', 'AB  - Our objective was to use formal systematic review methods to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in post-weaned ruminants by increasing animal resistance. The methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. The interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. There was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 (NPC 747) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. The effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of E. coli O157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. There were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. In general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. Few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. While the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to E. coli O157 that require further targeted research.')

('>F', 'TI  - An experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB against nonrotavirus diarrhea.', 'AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that selected strains of Lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. However, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. This study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. METHODS: The activity of a culture of L. acidophilus LB or of the lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering Afa/Dr Escherichia coli C1845 bacteria. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed L. acidophilus LB plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. RESULTS: Infection of the cells with C1845 bacteria that were treated with L. acidophilus LB culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated C1845 bacteria. The clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed L. acidophilus LB bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-killed L. acidophilus LB plus its culture medium antagonizes the C1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.')

('>F', 'TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?', "AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inactivated probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle on the phenotype and function of T- and B-cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with grass-pollen allergy (n=10) and non-allergic patients (n=19) were co-stimulated with inactivated bacteria and grass-pollen allergen. Expression of CD23, CD80, CD86 and CD69 were analysed, and the intracellular production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma was measured by direct ex vivo flow cytometry after stimulation. Both bacteria induced a significant up-regulation of CD69 expression on T-lymphocytes (p=0.001). CD23 expression was significantly increased following stimulation with allergen (p=0.008), but reduced after stimulation with Lactobacillus and significantly reduced with E. coli plus allergen (p=0.029). CD80 expression was reduced after stimulation with Lactobacillus in the allergic group only (p=0.021). By contrast, CD86 expression was significantly increased after stimulation with Lactobacillus (p=0.049) and distinctly increased with E. coli in both groups (p=0.001). The cytokine patterns of CD69-positive T-lymphocytes from allergic patients showed a TH2-dominated response after allergen stimulation (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratio 0.2), directed into a T-helper1-like response by stimulation with both types of bacteria (interferon-gamma/interleukin-4-ratios 1.5-2.0 in both groups). These data show that both types of bacteria modulate the allergic immune response by the alteration of CD23 and co-stimulatory molecule expression. Regarding cytokine production, the data suggest a differential response to both bacteria depending on the atopic state, but a clear promotion of T-helper1-dominated response in allergic donors.')

CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.')

('>F', 'TI  - Hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in Lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.', 'AB  - Lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. However, some species of Lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. Women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (IUD) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (N-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. It is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the growth of Escherichia coli. It is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. In this study, we identified Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. brevis, L. crispatus, L. fermentii and L. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. Seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. L. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.')

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cytotoxic inhibition test that used 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and toxin-binding ELISA assays, the activity of shiga-like toxin 2 (Stx-2) was inhibited profoundly by the cell lysates (10 mg ml(-1)) from two strains of L. acidophilus A4 and 30SC (>85% of survival rates compared with the control) among the five strains tested. In particular, a significant decline in the virulence level of E. coli O157:H7, under the presence of the cell lysates of L. acidophilus A4, was observed by killing assay of Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, L. acidophilus strains might be capable of attenuating the virulence of Stx-2 produced from E. coli O157:H7.

('>F', 'TI  - Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.', 'AB  - The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.')

('>F', 'TI  - Post-natal development of the porcine microbiota composition and activities.', 'AB  - The current study describes the development of the porcine microbiota and its metabolic activities during the neonatal and weaning period.

To further investigate the effect of weaning at 3 weeks of age, 19-day-old piglets (n = 64) were randomly allocated into two groups. Half of the piglets remained with their sows throughout the study, while the remaining piglets were weaned. As revealed by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, the samples of 2-day-old piglets harboured a consortium of bacteria related to Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Lactobacillus sobrius, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Moreover, species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assays unveiled that L. sobrius and L. reuteri predominated in the ileal samples of the neonatal and unweaned piglets with population levels up to 7 x 10(8) cells per gram of lumen content. Following weaning, however, these two lactobacilli were detected at significantly lower levels (< 10(3)) in the ileal samples. Furthermore, a shift in composition and metabolic activities of the predominant microbiota, and emergence of clostridia and E. coli, were encountered in the intestinal samples of the piglets after the early post-weaning period.')

In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis).

('>F', 'TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of Candida albicans biofilms.', 'AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro Candida albicans biofilm development. A single isolate of C. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, Actinomyces israelii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of Candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. A viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. Co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on Candida biofilm formation. Co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (P<0.05), except for L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and, S. intermedius co-cultures. Further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either P. gingivalis or E. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (P<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. Taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate C. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.')

('>F', 'TI  - Preinoculation with the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine Citrobacter rodentium colitis.', 'AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. The mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium causes a similar A/E lesion in the murine intestine. Like EPEC, C. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. Using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with Lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. Two-week old BALB/c mice were inoculated with L. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before C. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to C. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. The probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. We observed that L. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits C. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in C. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin (IL)-10]. Preinoculation with L. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal IgA secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and IL-12]. These observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. This study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.')

Effects on adhesion of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. Generally, CGMP exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. The CGMP reduced adhesion of VTEC strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of EPEC strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. The CGMP also reduced the adhesion of L. pentosus and L. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. A slight but significant reduction of L. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either Dsv. desulfuricans or L. gasseri.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens.

These oral administration of lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as Escherichia coli HGU-3. When lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on CCl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of the CCl4 control group, respectively. These lactic acid bacteria also showed the potent hepatoprotective effect against t-BHP-induced liver injury in mice. The inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (DDB), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. Among these lactic acid bacteria, L. acidophilus CSG exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect.

They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus.

Generally, these enzymes are not present in Lactobacillus spp. In this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous SOD to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. Thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing SOD (sodA) was cloned from Streptococcus thermophilus AO54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. A 1.2-kb PCR product containing the sodA gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pTRK563, to yield pSodA, which was functionally expressed and complemented an Escherichia coli strain deficient in Mn and FeSODs. The plasmid, pSodA, was subsequently introduced and expressed in Lactobacillus gasseri NCK334, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCK89, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCK56, and Lactobacillus reuteri NCK932. Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the gene (sodA) and the expression of an active gene product (MnSOD) in these strains of lactobacilli.

In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.')

The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.')

The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes.

Traditional meat starter cultures, containing a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and staphylococci, are used to maintain safety and sensory properties of Hungarian salami. The present study investigated if nontraditional meat starter (NTMS) cultures can be used for improving the safety of Hungarian salami. Salami batter was inoculated with List. monocytogenes and E. coli and subsequently fermented with NTMS cultures and a commercially available meat starter. A total of 15 NTMS cultures were tested. The salami was monitored for levels of pathogen, LAB and pH. When used in conjunction with the commercial meat starter, 9 NTMS cultures reduced the E. coli O111 count by more than 2.5 log units, whereas 10 of the NTMS cultures reduced List. monocytogenes by more than 2.5 log units. The commercial meat starter alone reduced E. coli and List. monocytogenes by 1.2 and 1.3 log units, respectively. Some NTMS cultures reduced the pathogen count without affecting pH of the salami batter. All NTMS cultures survived in salami throughout fermentation and maturation. It was concluded that NTMS cultures, including Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10, L. paracasei LAFTI L26, L. paracasei 5119, Lactobacillus sp.

Biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. Surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. The bacteria used were; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus B-13. Initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. The adhesion behaviour of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. However, the percentage of attached E. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while L. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. The comparative results indicated that the adhesion of BHK and MDBK cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic PHEMA surface and highest on the most hydrophobic PP surface. In contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.')

The aim of this study was to examine whether lactobacilli, a minor genus of the resident gut microflora, exerts a protective effect against the cellular injuries promoted by the diarrhoeagenic Afa/Dr diffusely adhering Escherichia coli (Afa/Dr DAEC) C1845 strain in human intestinal cells. METHODS: Cultured human intestinal fully differentiated enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells were used. Antibacterial activity was examined by measuring the viability of the adhering C1845 bacteria. The distribution of brush border associated cytoskeleton and functional proteins was examined by immunofluorescence labelling coupled to confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. RESULTS: The activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB isolated from the resident human gastrointestinal microflora was examined. A dose dependent decrease in viability of C1845 bacteria was observed after both direct contact in vitro between the spent culture supernatant (LB-SCS) and the bacteria, and when the bacteria were adherent on Caco-2/TC7 cells. Protection against the C1845 induced alterations in expression of F-actin, sucrase-isomaltase, dipeptidylpeptidase IV, alkaline phosphatase, and fructose transporter alterations was observed when the cells were exposed to LB-SCS.

Weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in C. perfringens and E. coli as compared to B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. fragilis, B. longum, or L. acidophilus. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid.

At 10 mg of activated charcoal, bacteria tested were completely adsorbed. Activated charcoal also had the capacity to adsorb toxin (verotoxin 2) activity from the bacterial extract. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of activated charcoal for the normal bacterial flora in the intestine was assessed using Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.

Intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (RIA), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. Clostridium tabificum vp 04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to 21.2 +/- 0.14 min (P < 0.01). Lactobacillus acidophilus A10 and Bifidobacterium bifidum B11 reduced the MMC period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (P < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (P < 0.05). Micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an MMC period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (P < 0.01). Inhibition was indicated also for Escherichia coli X7 gnotobiotic rats. No consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. The concentration of neuropeptide Y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. Intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the MMC depending on the species involved.

N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-guanidine (MNNG) mutagenesis of P15 was used to select for a promoter active in L. lactis MG1363. Molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated P16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a T-->A transversion. This deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. The activity of P16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pBV5030 (designated pLA16). The MIC of chloramphenicol in L. lactis, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, E. coli, and L. acidophilus harbouring pLA16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/mL, respectively.

In all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of Escherichia coli (P: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (P: < 0.05). The number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (P: < 0.05) in groups A and B over the same period. There was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (P: < 0.05) in all groups. The number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group A than in group C at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. Clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group A, but six persons each in groups B and C. Of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group A, one was similar to the strain of B. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of B. longum during the investigation period.

All possible di- and monoassociations of the three probiotics with gnotobiotic mice were also performed before experimental oral infection with Sfr. The data showed that antagonism was obtained only when E. coli EMO was present.

Tannic acid has a much greater relative binding efficiency to iron than propyl gallate, methyl gallate or gallic acid. The inhibitory effect of tannic acid to the growth of intestinal bacteria may be due to the strong iron binding capacity of tannic acid; whereas the effect of propyl gallate and methyl gallate probably occurs by a different mechanism. The growth of E. coli was restored by the addition of iron to the medium after the precipitate caused by tannic acid was removed. Neither B. infantis nor L. acidophilus require iron for growth. This probably contributes to their resistance to tannic acid. Because tannins are abundant in the human diet, tannins may affect the growth of some intestinal bacteria and thus may have an impact on human health.')

Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.')

The results indicated that Lact. acidophilus I 26 and Lact. fermentum I 25 could not significantly reduce the attachment of E. coli O1:K1, O2:K1 and O78:K80 to IEC under the three conditions tested in vitro, except that the attachment of E. coli O1:K1 was slightly reduced by Lact. fermentum I 25 in the test for competition.')

Some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. Human and bovine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Bacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. The adherence of bacteria was also observed microscopically after Gram staining. Viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. Among the tested strains, L. casei (Fyos) was the most adhesive strain and L. casei var. rhamnosus (Lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to Caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. The corresponding values for positive and negative control E. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. The Lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. The four most adhesive strains were L. casei (Fyos), L. acidophilus 1 (LC1), L. rhamnosus LC-705 and Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103). No significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. Adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of Caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the Caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. Viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90% of the bacteria were viable with the exception of L. acidophilus 1 which was 74% viable. Microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in Gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.')

In an effort to understand the possible mechanisms underlying this effect, we investigated the ability of LA1 to induce the production of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which have potent cytocidal and cytostatic effects on tumor cells. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was incubated with live or heat-killed cells of four strains of L. acidophilus or Bifidobacterium bifidum. Escherichia coli was used as a source of lipopolysaccharide that is known to induce the above cytokines. The amount of the cytokines present in the culture fluid was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LA1 induced the production of higher levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha than other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Stimulation of the production of the cytokines was not due to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component, since LPS at concentrations equivalent to, or 100-fold greater than, that of LA1 induced only negligible amounts of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha. These results reveal that non-LPS component(s) of LA1 stimulate(s) the production of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha by macrophages, indicating that this organism stimulates the production of immunologic factors.')

('>F', 'TI  - Deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyguanosine kinase of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26  are colinear products of a single gene.', 'AB  - Three of the four deoxynucleoside kinases required for growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 exist as heterodimeric pairs specific for deoxyadenosine (dAK) and deoxycytidine (dCK) or dAK and deoxyguanosine (dGK). However, only two tandem genes, dak/dgk, are found, and are expressed only as dAK/dGK in transformed Escherichia coli. Sequencing peptides spanning 63% of the native dCK subunit revealed a sequence identical to that deduced from dgk (beginning MTVIVL...), except that dCK lacks residues 2 and 3 (dCK is M..IVL; dGK is .TVIVL). Also, mass spectrometry indicates that native dCK and dGK subunits are identical in mass adjusted for the first three residues. Furthermore, the native enzymes have identical isoelectric pH values, indicating an equal number of charged residues. To enable E. coli to express peptide having the native dCK sequence, codons 2 and 3 were deleted from the dgk portion of the tandem genes, resulting in expression of protein having the specificities and regulatory properties of native dAK/dCK, including heterotropic stimulation of dAK activity by deoxycytidine or dCTP (not deoxyguanosine or dGTP) and end-product inhibition of the respective activities by dATP and dCTP. Subcloning normal and mutant dgk yielded homodimeric dGK and dCK, respectively. The dCK homodimer strongly resembles human dCK, with a low K(m) for deoxycytidine, the ability to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine at much higher K(m) values, and end-product inhibition by dCTP. Thus two distinct and specific enzymes evidently are derived from a single Lactobacillus gene. The mechanism by which this occurs in vivo has yet to be elucidated.')

BFMeT was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to Wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. A single oral administration of BFMeT induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. However, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. BFMeT-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. However, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Eubacterium limosum or Escherichia coli. An overnight culture of B. adolescentis or L. acidophilus or yogurt containing Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with BFMeT. Gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were Gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were Gram-negative rods. In the group of rats with ulcers induced by BFMeT, the Gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the Gram-negative rods including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Bacteroides increased by 37.3%. However, in the group of rats administered the Bifidobacterium culture, the Lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the Gram-negative rods were decreased. Although Lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods E.coli, Klebsiella and Proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with BFMeT, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with NSAIDs, and that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.')

A novel IIS type R/M system encoded by the LlaI operon has previously been characterized from the L. lactis conjugative plasmid pTR2030. The LlaI operon is composed of six genes: First, a small regulatory gene llaIC precedes the methylase gene llaIM. The following three genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, llaI.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llaIR. The forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llaIR gene cassette. We have successfully subcloned the three llaIR genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, and llaI.3, without llaIM, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors pTRKL2, pTRKH2, and pBV5030. A promoter (P6) from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, which is functional in E. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (Djordjevic and Topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. Restriction activity was evaluated in Escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. The llaIR restriction cassette was not functional in E. coli, but its presence was lethal to L. lactis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Carnobacterium pisicola, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Leuconostoc gelidum. Several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llaIR cassette. Insertions in llaI.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. These positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. Functional activity of the llaIR genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.')

In the present study, germfree rats were colonized with a mixture of two isogenic E. coli strains, one P fimbriated and the other type 1 fimbriated. Both types of fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. With two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype O75:K5:H-, the P-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; P < 0.0001). The expression of P fimbriae by 824 was also retained during colonization. With transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of P fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. When the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. In contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant E. coli strains colonized in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Peptostreptococcus sp. The results indicate that P fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota.

In this study, the LL-H gene mur was cloned into Escherichia coli, its nucleotide sequence was determined, and the enzyme produced in E. coli was purified and biochemically characterized. Mur was purified 112-fold by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation-exchange chromatography. The cell wall-hydrolyzing activity was found to be associated with a 34-kDa protein. The C-terminal domain of Mur is not essential for catalytic activity since it can be removed without destroying the lytic activity. The N-terminal sequence of the purified lysin was identical to that deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the first methionine is absent from the mature protein. The N-terminal part of this 297-amino-acid protein had homology with several Chalaropsis-type lysozymes. Reduction of purified and Mur-digested L. delbrueckii cell wall material with labeled NaB3H4 indicated that the enzyme is a muramidase.

Using polymerase chain reaction-generated probes based on N-terminal amino acid sequences, we have cloned tandem genes for 25- and 26-kDa polypeptides, whose derived amino acid sequences and size correspond to wild-type Lactobacillus enzyme subunits. Expression in Escherichia coli uses a single endogenous promoter and yields active dGK/dAK (approximately 3% of extracted protein) closely resembling wild-type dGK/dAK in specificity, kinetics, heterotropic activation, and end product inhibition. Alignment of cloned genes reveals 65% identity in their DNA sequences and 61% identity in derived amino acid sequences. Comparison with herpes-viral TKs reveals three conserved regions: glycine- and arginine-rich ATP-binding motifs and a D/E-R-S/H motif at the putative TK deoxynucleoside site.

Strains of Lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and Lact. acidophilus and Lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. Lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture.

Tests were made with [14C]-labelled E. coli. Suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. Counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of E. coli attachment. Some strains of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic E. coli with K88 fimbriae, but not with a K88-negative mutants strain. These were excluded from the competitive exclusion experiments.

The nucleotide sequence of the slpA gene was determined and appeared to encode a protein of 444 amino acids. The first 24 amino acids resembled a putative secretion signal, giving rise to a mature S-protein of 420 amino acids (44.2 kDa).

Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid.

('?F#ATT', 'TI  - Exclusion of uropathogen adhesion to polymer surfaces by Lactobacillus acidophilus.', 'AB  - The ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is a major cause of concern in the  use of biomaterial substrates. The adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1938 was examined using image analysis and was found not to correlate with polymer surface tension, unlike that of Lactobacillus acidophilus, which adhered to more hydrophobic polymers. A fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli strain showed very low levels of adherence to the biomaterials. Precoating the polymers with lactobacilli significantly reduced the staphylococcal and E. coli adhesion, a result which could have clinical significance. An additional finding was that the interaction of staphylococci and E. coli with lactobacilli coated polymers altered the adhesion profile of the latter. Lactobacilli appeared to detach from polymers of low surface tension and reattach to polymers with high surface tensions. This resulted in the highest levels of exclusion of uropathogens being found for lactobacilli-coated glass and sulfonated polystyrene, both of which are hydrophilic (with high surface tensions). These results demonstrate that lactobacilli can be used to coat biomaterial surfaces leading to a reduced adhesion of uropathogens.')

Populations of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, or Lactobacillus acidophilus were transiently, though not significantly, suppressed by S. typhimurium. Inoculation of chickens with C. perfringens caused a terminal increase in the population of S. typhimurium.

The purified enzyme exhibits optimal activity in the presence of Mn2+, while Mg2+ shows only a slight effect. The L. acidophilus enzyme transcribes several Escherichia coli promoters examined so far, such as promoters of trp operon, lacUV5, and bla P3 from pBR322, whereas it lacks the ability to recognize bla P1 and tet P2 promoters from pBR322. Thus, the specificity of L. acidophilus RNA polymerase in recognizing the promoters is somehow different from that of the E. coli enzyme. By means of an in vitro transcription assay system for L. acidophilus RNA polymerase, 2 promoters have been identified in the DNA of an L. acidophilus cryptic plasmid (pRNL5). These promoters possess nucleotide sequences in the -10 region similar to the consensus sequence for the E. coli promoters.")

Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%).

Specific pathogene-free (SPF) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. The rats colonized with Escherichia coli or Bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in SPF rats.

Furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of E. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in SPF rats. These results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of SPF rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, P. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and E. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.')

Microbiologic studies of jejunal aspirates indicated that orally ingested Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus in LactinexR and L. acidophilus in Infloran BernaR survived passage through the stomach and remained viable in the proximal small bowel for three to six hours in most, not all, individuals. Challenge studies with ETEC revealed that despite the ability of lactobacilli in LactinexR to persist in the upper small intestine for several hours, the lactobacillus preparation did not prevent or alter the course of ETEC diarrhea in adults. Lactobacillus therapy with one lot of LactinexR reduced the volume and duration of neomycin-associated diarrhea, whereas another lot of LactinexR had no therapeutic effect. Thus, lot to lot variations in lactobacillus preparations may account for some conflicting results observed with lactobacillus therapy for intestinal disorders.')

All the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by C. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. Lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by Staphylococcus pyogene, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by C. albicans.

Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3.5). In sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta.

When L. acidophilus was employed, the addition of H(2)O(2) was not required; however, the protective effect of catalase suggested that, in this instance, H(2)O(2) was generated by the organisms. The antibacterial effect was largely prevented by preheating the myeloperoxidase at 80 C or greater for 10 min or by the addition of a number of inhibitors; it was most active at the most acid pH employed (5.0). Lactoperoxidase was considerably less effective than was myeloperoxidase when chloride was the halide employed. Myeloperoxidase, at high concentrations, exerted an antibacterial effect on L. acidophilus in the absence of added halide, which also was temperature- and catalase-sensitive. Peroxidase was extracted from intact guinea pig leukocytes by weak acid, and the extract with peroxidase activity had antibacterial properties which were similar, in many respects, to those of the purified preparation of myeloperoxidase. Under appropriate conditions, the antibacterial effect was increased by halides and by H(2)O(2) and was decreased by catalase, as well as by cyanide, azide, Tapazole, and thiosulfate. This suggests that, under the conditions employed, the antibacterial properties of a weak acid extract of guinea pig leukocytes is due, in part, to its peroxidase content, particularly if a halide is present in the reaction mixture.

Experiments using an Escherichia coli strain susceptible to all antimicrobials were also conducted. C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or Lactobacillus plantarum. Survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. Experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium lactis; LactoLevure((R))). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed P. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. Pre-treatment with L. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either MDR P. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%; P=0.026) or E. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, P=0.003). Survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with LactoLevure((R)). Tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. TNFalpha and IL-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and IFNgamma production was decreased. Pre-treatment with LactoLevure((R)) restored production of IL-17. Stimulation of human PBMCs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of SOCS3.

Fecal samples were collected (n = 3,360) from the rectum from each animal every 3 weeks, and E. coli O157:H7 was isolated by standard procedures, using selective enrichment, immunomagnetic separation, and PCR confirmation. The outcome variable was the recovery of E. coli O157:H7 from feces, and was modeled using logistic regression accounting for year, repeated measures of pens of cattle, and block. No significant differences were detected for gain, intakes, or feed efficiency of control or NP51-fed steers. The probability for cattle to shed E. coli O157:H7 varied significantly between 2002 and 2003 (P = 0.004).

Since sCD14 is also known to interact with gram-positive bacteria and their components, we looked at whether sCD14 could mediate their effects on human IECs. To this end, we examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines following exposure of the IECs to specific gram-positive bacteria or their lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) in the absence and presence of human milk as a source of sCD14. In contrast to LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella enteritidis, neither the gram-positive bacteria Lactobacillus johnsonii strain La1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus strain La10 nor their LTAs stimulated IECs, even in the presence of sCD14. However, both LTAs inhibited the sCD14-mediated LPS responsiveness of IECs. We have previously hypothesized that sCD14 in human milk is a means by which the neonate gauges the bacterial load in the intestinal lumen and liberates protective proinflammatory cytokines from IECs. The present observations suggest that gram-positive organisms, via their LTAs, temper this response and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response.')
