TI  == differentiation of incl and incm plasmids associated with the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == introduction: blaoxa-48, blandm-1 and blactx-m-3 are clinically relevant resistance genes, frequently associated with the broad-host range plasmids of the incl/m group. the l and m plasmids belong to two compatible groups, which were incorrectly classified together by molecular methods. in order to understand their evolution, we fully sequenced four incl/m plasmids, including the reference plasmids r471 and r69, the recently described blaoxa-48-carrying plasmid pkpn-el.nr7 from a klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in bern (switzerland), and the  blashv-5 carrying plasmid p202c from a salmonella enterica from tirana (albania). methods: sequencing was performed using 454 junior genome sequencer (roche). annotation was performed using sequin and artemis software. plasmid sequences were compared with 13 fully sequenced plasmids belonging to the incl/m group available in genbank. results: comparative analysis of plasmid genomes revealed two distinct genetic lineages, each containing one of the r471 (incl) and r69 (incm) reference plasmids. conjugation experiments demonstrated that plasmids representative of the incl and incm groups were compatible with each other. the incl group is constituted by the blaoxa-48-carrying plasmids and r471. the incm group contains two sub-types of plasmids named incm1 and incm2 that are each incompatible. conclusion: this work re-defines the structure of the incl and incm families and ascribes a definitive designation to the fully sequenced incl/m plasmids available in genbank.

TI  == removal of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by combinations of oxidizing compounds.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are commonly formed on medical devices and food processing surfaces. the antimicrobials used have limited efficacy against the biofilms; therefore, new strategies to prevent and remove these structures are needed. here, the effectiveness of brief oxidative treatments, based on the combination of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the presence of copper sulfate (cuso4), were evaluated against bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates, both in planktonic and biofilm states. simultaneous application of oxidants synergistically inactivated planktonic cells and prevented biofilm formation of laboratory escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as clinical isolates of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, klebsiella oxytoca, and uropathogenic e. coli. in addition, preformed biofilms of e. coli c, salmonella typhimurium, k. pneumoniae, and salmonella enterica exposed to treatments were removed by applying 12 mg/l naclo, 0.1 mmol/l cuso4, and 350 mmol/l h2o2 for 5 min. klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus required a 5-fold increase in naclo concentration, and the e. coli clinical isolate remained unremovable unless treatments were applied on biofilms formed within 24 h instead of 48 h. the application of treatments that last a few minutes using oxidizing compounds at low concentrations represents an interesting disinfection strategy against pathogens associated with medical and industrial settings.

TI  == [periplasmic lysozime inhibitior plic and its role in antilysozime activity of enterobacteria].
AB  == two families of specific inhibitors of type c lysozyme (ivy and plic) secreted from the periplasmic space are known in enterobacteria. microbial capacity for distant lysozyme inactivation (antilysozyme activity) is most pronounced in the strains and species carrying homologues of the plicgene. the plic homologue localized in a -200-kbp megaplasmid of klebsiella pneumoniae was shown to differ  significantly in the amino acid composition of the coded polypeptide. similar to  the salmonella enterica plic homologue, it possesses a detachable signal part and contains identical functionally critical amino acids of the active center of the  inhibitor. antilysozyme activity of the plic-positive k. pneumoniae strains was observed at the level corresponding to the highest values found inplic-positive s. enterica. high level of the antilysozyme activity in k. pneumoniae strains containing the plasmid plic homologue was found in all studied strains, unlike s. enterica strains carrying the known chromosomal plic homologue.

TI  == development of a protocol for predicting bacterial resistance to microbicides.
AB  == regulations dealing with microbicides in europe and the united states are evolving and now require data on the risk of the development of resistance in organisms targeted by microbicidal products. there is no standard protocol to assess the risk of the development of resistance to microbicidal formulations. this study aimed to validate the use of changes in microbicide and antibiotic susceptibility as initial markers for predicting microbicide resistance and cross-resistance to antibiotics. three industrial isolates (pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and two salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains (sl1344 and 14028s) were exposed to a shampoo, a mouthwash, eye makeup remover, and the microbicides contained within these formulations (chlorhexidine digluconate [chg] and benzalkonium chloride [bzc]) under realistic, in-use conditions. baseline and postexposure data were compared. no significant increases in the mic or the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were observed for any strain after exposure to the three formulations. increases as high as 100-fold in the mics and mbcs of chg and bzc for sl1344 and 14028s were observed but were unstable. changes in antibiotic susceptibility were not clinically significant. the use of mics and mbcs combined with antibiotic susceptibility profiling and stability testing generated reproducible data that allowed for an initial prediction of the development of resistance to microbicides. these approaches measure characteristics that are directly relevant to the concern over resistance and cross-resistance development following the use of microbicides. these are low-cost, high-throughput techniques, allowing manufacturers to provide to regulatory bodies, promptly and  efficiently, data supporting an early assessment of the risk of resistance development.

TI  == partition locus-based classification of selected plasmids in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica spp.: an additional tool.
AB  == the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes in enterobacteriaceae has been largely attributed to plasmids, circular dna molecules capable of autonomous replication. whereas high-copy-number plasmids primarily rely on passive diffusion for plasmid maintenance, low-copy-number plasmids utilize so-called partition (par) systems. plasmid partition relies on three structures, i.e. a centromere like dna site, a centromere-binding protein and an atpase or a gtpase  motor protein for plasmid positioning. identification and classification of plasmids is essential for tracing plasmids conferring drug resistance. pcr-based  replicon typing is currently the standard method for plasmid identification but there are new classification schemes, especially the relaxase gene typing (praset). here we developed a multiplex pcr set targeting par loci found on the plasmids most frequently encountered in enterobacteriaceae. this method, called "plasmid partition gene typing" (par-t), was validated with 136 transconjugants or transformants harboring various replicon types. the method was tested with 30  multidrug-resistant clinical isolates including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica carrying 1-4 replicons; all replicons were tested in parallel with praset for comparison. six multiplex pcrs  and one simplex pcr including 18 pairs of primers recognized plasmids of groups inca/c, fia, fib, fic, fiik, fii, hi1, hi2, i1, l/m, n, x. our set of multiplex pcrs showed high specificity for the classification of resistance plasmids except for incx replicons.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == identification of antigenic proteins of the nosocomial pathogen klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == the continuous expansion of nosocomial infections around the globe has become a precarious situation. key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. in many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. however, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. the aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. hence, a cdna-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). after screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by elisa and microarray analyses. consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. after specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence gavvalsttfa of kpn_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for k. pneumoniae. the remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for k. pneumoniae. the approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enterica antigens before. now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, k. pneumoniae. by identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved  the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.

TI  == a novel, broad-range, ctxphi-derived stable integrative expression vector for functional studies.
AB  == ctxphi, a filamentous vibriophage encoding cholera toxin, uses a unique strategy  for its lysogeny. the single-stranded phage genome forms intramolecular base-pairing interactions between two inversely oriented xerc and xerd binding sites (xbs) and generates a functional phage attachment site, attp(+), for integration. the attp(+) structure is recognized by the host-encoded tyrosine recombinases xerc and xerd (xercd), which enables irreversible integration of ctxphi into the chromosome dimer resolution site (dif) of vibrio cholerae. the dif site and the xercd recombinases are widely conserved in bacteria. we took advantage of these conserved attributes to develop a broad-host-range integrative expression vector that could irreversibly integrate into the host chromosome using xercd recombinases without altering the function of any known open reading  frame (orf). in this study, we engineered two different arabinose-inducible expression vectors, pbd62 and pbd66, using xbs of ctxphi. pbd62 replicates conditionally and integrates efficiently into the dif of the bacterial chromosome by site-specific recombination using host-encoded xercd recombinases. the expression level of the gene of interest could be controlled through the pbad promoter by modulating the functions of the vector-encoded transcriptional factor arac. we validated the irreversible integration of pbd62 into a wide range of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, such as v. cholerae, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio parahaemolyticus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and klebsiella pneumoniae. gene expression from the pbad promoter of integrated vectors was confirmed in v. cholerae using the well-studied reporter genes mcherry, egfp, and lacz.

TI  == detection of salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) method targeting bcfd gene.
AB  == in this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay for salmonella detection targeting bcfd gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in salmonella. the salmonella lamp assay  we developed successfully amplified 44 salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-salmonella standard strains (proteus mirabilis, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni and vibrio parahemolyticus). the detection limit was 5 cfu of salmonella pure culture or 200 cfu of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent  to 5000 cfu g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. our experiments show that the lamp method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for salmonella detection. the salmonella lamp assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. significance and impact of the study: a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay was established to detect salmonella targeting bcfd gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. the detection limit was 5 cfu of salmonella pure culture or 200 cfu of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 cfu g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of  25 min. the salmonella lamp assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.

TI  == c-terminal domain swapping of ssb changes the size of the ssdna binding site.
AB  == single-stranded dna-binding protein (ssb) plays an important role in dna metabolism, including dna replication, repair, and recombination, and is therefore essential for cell survival. bacterial ssb consists of an n-terminal ssdna-binding/oligomerization domain and a flexible c-terminal protein-protein interaction domain. we characterized the ssdna-binding properties of klebsiella pneumoniae ssb (kpssb), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 ssb (stssb),  pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 ssb (passb), and two chimeric kpssb proteins, namely, kpssbnstssbc and kpssbnpassbc. the c-terminal domain of stssb or passb was exchanged with that of kpssb through protein chimeragenesis. by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we characterized the stoichiometry of kpssb, stssb, passb, kpssbnstssbc, and kpssbnpassbc, complexed with a series of ssdna homopolymers. the binding site sizes were determined to be 26 +/- 2, 21 +/- 2, 29 +/- 2, 21 +/- 2, and 29 +/- 2 nucleotides (nt), respectively. comparison of the binding site sizes of kpssb, kpssbnstssbc, and kpssbnpassbc showed that the c-terminal domain swapping of ssb changes the size of the binding site. our observations suggest that not only the conserved n-terminal domain but also the c-terminal domain of ssb is an important determinant for ssdna binding.

TI  == evaluation of gram-negative bacterial infection by a stable and conjugative bioluminescence plasmid in a mouse model.
AB  == background: the green fluorescence protein (gfp)-associated fluorescence method and the luciferase-associated bioluminescence method are the two major methods for ivis imaging system to investigate the bacterial infection in animal models.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the infection route of gram-negative bacteria carrying a stable and broad range of conjugative bioluminescence plasmid pse-lux1 in a mouse model. results: both encapsulated and non-encapsulated gram-negative bacteria were used as hosts to evaluate conjugation efficiency and  plasmid stability of pse-lux1, a recombinant of pse34 and luxabcde operon. the plasmid conjugation efficiencies of pse-lux1 ranged from 10(-)(3) to 10(-)(7) in  various gram-negative bacteria. plasmid pse-lux1 maintained in escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella enterica serovars choleraesues (abbreviated s. choleraesuis) and typhimurium (s. typhimurium), than in acinetobacter baumannii and serratia marcescens, was shown to be of better stability for at least four days. to investigate systemic bacterial infections, k. pneumoniae strain cg354 was intravenously injected, and then was clearly observed to be non-pathogenic to balb/c mice for a long-term bioluminescence monitoring for 6 days. for examining dynamic distributions of gastrointestinal tract infection, the invasion protein sipb-deficient mutant ou5045 big up tri, opensipb and ou5046 big up tri, opensipb of s. serovar typhimurium constructed in this study, compared to wild-type strain ou5045 and its virulence plasmid-less strain ou5046, were of less virulence to mice. conclusions: this is the first study to evaluate  the conjugative and stable bioluminescence vehicle system of pse-lux1 in a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, a system that can provide a useful reporter approach to trace systemic and gastrointestinal bacterial infections in a mouse model.

TI  == lethal synergy involving bicyclomycin: an approach for reviving old antibiotics.
AB  == background: one way to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance is to revive old compounds that may have intrinsic lethal activity that is obscured  by protective factors. bicyclomycin is an old inhibitor of the rho transcription  terminator that by itself shows little rapid lethal activity. however, bicyclomycin participates in bacteriostatic synergy, which raises the possibility that conditions for lethal synergy may exist, perhaps through a suppression of protective factors. methods: bicyclomycin was combined with bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression, and bactericidal activity was measured with several cultured gram-negative pathogens. results: when used alone, bicyclomycin  failed to rapidly kill growing cultures of escherichia coli; however, the additional presence of bacteriostatic concentrations of tetracycline, chloramphenicol or rifampicin led to rapid killing. four other pathogen species,  acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and shigella dysenteriae, also exhibited enhanced killing when bicyclomycin was combined with tetracycline or rifampicin. this lethal synergy was achieved at low concentrations (slightly above the mic) for all agents tested in combinations. follow-up work with e. coli indicated that lethal synergy arose  from a blockage of transcription elongation. moreover, lethal synergy was reduced when bicyclomycin was added 60 min before tetracycline, suggesting that bicyclomycin induces a protective factor. conclusions: the action of bicyclomycin illustrates the potential present in a largely abandoned antibacterial agent; it  exhibits lethal synergy when coadministered with known, bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression. the identification of protective factors, which are currently uncharacterized, may reveal new ways to promote the lethal action of some old antibiotics.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == high prevalence of blactx-m-1/inci1/st3 and blacmy-2/inci1/st2 plasmids in healthy urban dogs in france.
AB  == in the community, close contacts between humans and dogs may promote the transfer of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase/plasmidic ampc cephalosporinase (esbl/pampc)  genes. large-scale prevalence studies on esbl/pampc carriage in dogs are rare, and data on esbl/pampc plasmids are even more limited. here, a considerable rate  of 18.5% esbl/pampc carriers was found among 368 unrelated healthy dogs in paris, france. this prevalence is much higher than the one found in healthy humans in the same city (6%) but close to that recently reported in dogs in china (24.5%).  all isolates were identified as escherichia coli, except one salmonella enterica  and one klebsiella pneumoniae isolate. the sequence type 131 (st131) clone was rare (2/73 isolates). interestingly, two plasmids (blactx-m-1/inci1/st3 and blacmy-2/inci1/st2) were unexpectedly highly predominant, raising the question of their successful spread. considering that ctx-m-1 was recently found to be equally as abundant as ctx-m-15 in healthy parisian subjects, the question of dogs being a ctx-m-1 reservoir for humans is open. such a high prevalence of the  blacmy-2/inci1/st2 plasmid may result from the use of cephalexin in veterinary medicine, as previously demonstrated experimentally. in all, our study points out healthy urban dogs as a potential source of esbl/pampc genes that can further disseminate to the human community.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == gil, a new c-di-gmp-binding protein domain involved in regulation of cellulose synthesis in enterobacteria.
AB  == in contrast to numerous enzymes involved in c-di-gmp synthesis and degradation in enterobacteria, only a handful of c-di-gmp receptors/effectors have been identified. in search of new c-di-gmp receptors, we screened the escherichia coli aska overexpression gene library using the differential radial capillary action of ligand assay (dracala) with fluorescently and radioisotope-labelled c-di-gmp.  we uncovered three new candidate c-di-gmp receptors in e. coli and characterized  one of them, bcse. the bcse gene is encoded in cellulose synthase operons in representatives of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria. the purified bcse  proteins from e. coli, salmonella enterica and klebsiella pneumoniae bind c-di-gmp via the domain of unknown function, duf2819, which is hereby designated  gil, ggdef i-site like domain. the rxgd motif of the gil domain is required for c-di-gmp binding, similar to the c-di-gmp-binding i-site of the diguanylate cyclase ggdef domain. thus, gil is the second protein domain, after pilz, dedicated to c-di-gmp-binding. we show that in s. enterica, bcse is not essential for cellulose synthesis but is required for maximal cellulose production, and that c-di-gmp binding is critical for bcse function. it appears that cellulose production in enterobacteria is controlled by a two-tiered c-di-gmp-dependent system involving bcse and the pilz domain containing glycosyltransferase bcsa.

TI  == broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  == bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppgpp, an important signal in biofilm development. at concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth,  peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium and burkholderia cenocepacia. low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. we hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppgpp synthesis through the enzymes rela and spot, was targeted. consistent with this, increasing (p)ppgpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of rela led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. furthermore, rela and spot mutations blocking production of (p)ppgpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. also, eliminating (p)ppgpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing rela behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. nmr and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppgpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with  ppgpp. we thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppgpp and marks it for degradation in cells. targeting (p)ppgpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug  resistance.

TI  == phytochemistry and preliminary assessment of the antibacterial activity of chloroform extract of amburana cearensis (allemao) a.c. sm. against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains.
AB  == the chloroform extract of the stem bark of amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.the extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. the main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which  was purchased commercially.we have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus cereus. conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced mics ranging from215 to 431 mu g/ml against all bacterial species.new antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound  against klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarmicresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (mbc) of 431 mu g/ml.we conclude that a. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.

AB  == objectives: in 2009, ctx-m enterobacteriaceae and salmonella isolates were recovered from a uk pig farm, prompting studies into the dissemination of the resistance and to establish any relationships between the isolates. methods: pfge was used to elucidate clonal relationships between isolates whilst plasmid profiling, restriction analysis, sequencing and pcr were used to characterize the ctx-m-harbouring plasmids. results: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella 4,5,12:i:- and bovismorbificans resistant to cefotaxime (n = 65) were  recovered and 63 were shown by pcr to harbour a group 1 ctx-m gene. the harbouring hosts were diverse, but the group 1 ctx-m plasmids were common. three  sequenced ctx-m plasmids from e. coli, k. pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serotype 4,5,12:i:- were identical except for seven mutations and highly similar  to inci1 plasmid colib-p9. two antimicrobial resistance regions were identified:  one inserted upstream of yacabc harbouring iscr2 transposases, sul2 and flor; and the other inserted within shfb of the pilv shufflon harbouring the isecp1 transposase followed by blactx-m-1. conclusions: these data suggest that an st108 inci1 plasmid encoding a blactx-m-1 gene had disseminated across multiple genera  on this farm, an example of horizontal gene transfer of the blactx-m-1 gene.

TI  == species-selective killing of bacteria by antimicrobial peptide-pnas.
AB  == broad-spectrum antimicrobials kill indiscriminately, a property that can lead to  negative clinical consequences and an increase in the incidence of resistance. species-specific antimicrobials that could selectively kill pathogenic bacteria without targeting other species in the microbiome could limit these problems. the pathogen genome presents an excellent target for the development of such antimicrobials. in this study we report the design and evaluation of species-selective peptide nucleic acid (pna) antibacterials. selective growth inhibition of b. subtilis, e. coli, k. pnuemoniae and s. enterica serovar typhimurium in axenic or mixed culture could be achieved with pnas that exploit species differences in the translation initiation region of essential genes. an s. typhimurium-specific pna targeting ftsz resulted in elongated cells that were  not observed in e. coli, providing phenotypic evidence of the selectivity of pna-based antimicrobials. analysis of the genomes of e. coli and s. typhimurium gave a conservative estimate of >150 pna targets that could potentially discriminate between these two closely related species. this work provides a basis for the development of a new class of antimicrobial with a tuneable spectrum of activity.

TI  == allantoinase and dihydroorotase binding and inhibition by flavonols and the substrates of cyclic amidohydrolases.
AB  == allantoinase and dihydroorotase are members of the cyclic amidohydrolases family. allantoinase and dihydroorotase possess very similar binuclear metal centers in the active site and may use a similar mechanism for catalysis. however, whether the substrate specificities of allantoinase and dihydroorotase overlap and whether the substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases inhibit allantoinase and dihydroorotase remain unknown. in this study, the binding and inhibition of allantoinase (salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2) and dihydroorotase (klebsiella pneumoniae) by flavonols and the substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases were investigated. hydantoin and phthalimide, substrates of hydantoinase and imidase, were not hydrolyzed by allantoinase and dihydroorotase. hydantoin and dihydroorotate competitively inhibited allantoinase, whereas hydantoin and allantoin bind to dihydroorotase, but do not affect its activity. we further investigated the effects of the flavonols myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin, on the inhibition of allantoinase and dihydroorotase. allantoinase and dihydroorotase were both significantly inhibited by kaempferol,  with ic50 values of 35 +/- 3 mum and 31 +/- 2 mum, respectively. myricetin strongly inhibited dihydroorotase, with an ic50 of 40 +/- 1 mum. the double reciprocal of the lineweaver-burk plot indicated that kaempferol was a competitive inhibitor for allantoinase but an uncompetitive inhibitor for dihydroorotase. a structural study using patchdock showed that kaempferol was docked in the active site pocket of allantoinase but outside the active site pocket of dihydroorotase. these results constituted a first study that naturally  occurring product flavonols inhibit the cyclic amidohydrolases, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase, even more than the substrate analogs (>3 orders of magnitude). thus, flavonols may serve as drug leads for designing compounds that target several cyclic amidohydrolases.

TI  == liquid based formulations of bacteriophages for the management of waterborne bacterial pathogens in water microcosms.
AB  == water resources are contaminated by life-threatening multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria. unfortunately, these pathogenic bacteria do not respond to the traditional water purification methods. therefore, there is a need of environmentally friendly strategies to overcome the problems associated with the  antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens. in the present study, highly potent  lytic phages against multidrug-resistant salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi b, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from the pavana river water. they belonged to the podoviridae and siphoviridae families. these phages were purified and enriched in the laboratory. monovalent formulations of phispb, bvpap-3 and kpp phages were prepared in three different liquids viz., phage broth, saline and distilled water. the phages were stable for almost 8-10 months in the phage broth at 4 degrees c. the stability of the phages in saline and distilled water was 5-6 months at 4 degrees c. all of the phages were stable  only for 4-6 months in the phage broth at 30 degrees c. the monovalent phage formulation of psispb was applied at moi < 1, as disinfectant against an exponential and stationary phase cells of salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi b in various water microcosms. the results indicated that there was almost 80 % reduction in the log phase cells of salmonella serovar paratyphi b in 24 h. in stationary phase cells, the reduction was comparatively less within same period.  at the same time, there was concomitant increase in the phage population by 80% in all the microcosms indicating that psispb phage is highly potent in killing pathogen in water. results strongly support that the formulation of psispb in the phage broth in monovalent form could be used as an effective biological disinfectant for preventing transmission of water-borne bacterial pathogens, including antimicrobial resistant ones.

TI  == targeting relaxase genes for classification of the predominant plasmids in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == plasmids are the main vectors of antimicrobial drug resistance and virulence genes, especially in enterobacteriaceae. identification and classification of plasmids is essential for analysis of their distribution. the most widely used typing method is pcr-based replicon typing (pbrt). a new classification scheme based on relaxase gene typing has been described recently. we propose a practical application of this method, with the development of a multiplex pcr set targeting relaxase genes found on plasmids most frequently encountered in enterobacteriaceae. this method, here called "plasmid relaxase gene typing" (praset), was validated with 60 transconjugants and transformants harboring various replicon types. the method was tested with 39 multidrug-resistant clinical isolates including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica carrying 1-7 replicons as well as with 17 plasmids non-typeable using pbrt; all replicons were tested in parallel with pbrt for comparison. six multiplex pcrs and one simplex pcr, including 24 pairs of primers, recognized plasmids of groups a/c, b/o, cole, fia, fib, fic, fv, fiik, hi1, hi2, i1, k, l/m, n, p1alpha, q1, u, w, x1, x2, x3 and x4. there was perfect  correlation between praset and pbrt results in 31/39 (79.5%) clinical isolates. moreover, 11/17 (64.7%) plasmids non-typeable by pbrt could be typed by praset. our set of multiplex pcrs showed high sensitivity and specificity for the classification of resistance plasmids. it has proved complementary to the widely  used pbrt and will improve the monitoring of plasmid distribution in every-day practice.

TI  == investigation of the antibacterial activity of a short cationic peptide against multidrug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium strains and  its cytotoxicity on eukaryotic cells.
AB  == with the growing microbial resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents, the development of novel and alternative therapeutic strategies are vital. during recent years novel peptide antibiotics with broad spectrum activity against many  gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have been developed. in this study, antibacterial activity of cm11 peptide (wklfkkilkvl-nh2), a short cecropin-melittin hybrid peptide, is evaluated against antibiotic-resistant strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium as two important pathogenic bacteria. to appraise the antibacterial activity, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and bactericidal killing assay were utilized with different concentrations (2-128 mg/l) of peptide. to evaluate cytotoxic effect of peptide, viability of raji, hela, sp2/0, cho, lncap cell lines and primary murine macrophage cells were also investigated  with mtt assay in different concentrations (3-24 and 0.5-16 mg/l, respectively).  mics of k. pneumoniae and s. typhimurium isolates were in range of 8-16 and 4-16  mg/l, respectively. in bactericidal killing assay no colonies were observed at 2x mic for k. pneumoniae and s. typhimurium isolates after 80-90 min, respectively.  despite the fact that cm11 reveals no significant cytotoxicity on raji, hela, sp2/0, and cho cell lines beneath 6 mg/l at first 24 and 48 h, the viability of lncap cells are about 50 % at 3 mg/l, which indicates strong cytotoxicity of the  peptide. in addition, macrophage toxicity by mtt assay showed that ld50 of cm11 peptide is 12 mum (16 mg/l) after 48 h while in this concentration after 24 h macrophage viability was about 70 %.

TI  == in vitro effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptide ecath1 against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens of horses.
AB  == the equine antimicrobial peptide ecath1 previously has been shown to have in vitro activity against antibiotic-susceptible reference strains of rhodococcus equi and common respiratory bacterial pathogens of foals. interestingly, ecath1 was also found to be effective in the treatment of r. equi infection induced in mice. the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of ecath1 against equine isolates of gram-negative (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas spp.) and gram-positive (r. equi, staphylococcus aureus) bacteria resistant to multiple classes of conventional antibiotics. a modified microdilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the antimicrobial peptide. the study revealed that ecath1 was active against all equine isolates of e. coli, s. enterica, k. pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. and r. equi tested, with mics of 0.5-16 mug ml(-1),  but was not active against most isolates of s. aureus. in conclusion, the activity of the equine antimicrobial peptide ecath1 appears to not be hampered by the antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates. thus, the data suggest that ecath1 could be useful, not only in the treatment of r. equi infections, but also of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == comparative sequence, structure and redox analyses of klebsiella pneumoniae dsba  show that anti-virulence target dsba enzymes fall into distinct classes.
AB  == bacterial dsba enzymes catalyze oxidative folding of virulence factors, and have  been identified as targets for antivirulence drugs. however, dsba enzymes characterized to date exhibit a wide spectrum of redox properties and divergent structural features compared to the prototypical dsba enzyme of escherichia coli  dsba (ecdsba). nonetheless, sequence analysis shows that dsbas are more highly conserved than their known substrate virulence factors, highlighting the potential to inhibit virulence across a range of organisms by targeting dsba. for example, salmonella enterica typhimurium (sedsba, 86 % sequence identity to ecdsba) shares almost identical structural, surface and redox properties. using comparative sequence and structure analysis we predicted that five other bacterial dsbas would share these properties. to confirm this, we characterized klebsiella pneumoniae dsba (kpdsba, 81 % identity to ecdsba). as expected, the redox properties, structure and surface features (from crystal and nmr data) of kpdsba were almost identical to those of ecdsba and sedsba. moreover, kpdsba and  ecdsba bind peptides derived from their respective dsbbs with almost equal affinity, supporting the notion that compounds designed to inhibit ecdsba will also inhibit kpdsba. taken together, our data show that dsbas fall into different classes; that dsbas within a class may be predicted by sequence analysis of binding loops; that dsbas within a class are able to complement one another in vivo and that compounds designed to inhibit ecdsba are likely to inhibit dsbas within the same class.

TI  == recombinant heat shock protein 60 (hsp60/groel) of salmonella enterica serovar typhi elicits cross-protection against multiple bacterial pathogens in mice.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsps) or stress proteins are recognized as protective antigens against a wide range of bacterial diseases. conservation of hsps across  different life forms also appears to contribute to the antigenicity of these proteins. due to their high sequence homology, there exists an immunological cross-recognition between different bacterial species. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of recombinant groel of salmonella enterica serovar typhi  as a vaccine candidate against various bacterial pathogens viz.; shigella dysenteriae type i, shigella flexneri, shigella boydii, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in vitro serum bactericidal assay (sba) with groel antisera showed 50-55% inhibition of cells of shigella spp., 65-75% of e. coli, 60-65% of k. pneumoniae, 45-50% of  p. aeruginosa. in in vivo experiments, mice immunized with groel protein of s. typhi showed 60-65% protection against s. flexneri, s. dysenteriae type i, s. boydii. similarly 75-80% protection was observed against enteropathogenic e. coli, 70-80% against k. pneumoniae. 50% of mice survived the lethal infection against p. aeruginosa. organ burden and histopathological studies also revealed significant reduction of bacterial infection. this study shows the cross-protective efficacy of recombinant groel of s. typhi which could lead to the development of a single vaccine candidate protective against multiple bacterial pathogens.

TI  == insights into the evolution of gene organization and multidrug resistance from klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pkf3-140.
AB  == plasmid-mediated transfer of drug-resistance genes among various bacterial species is considered one of the most important mechanisms for the spread of multidrug resistance. to gain insights into the evolution of gene organization and antimicrobial resistance in clinical bacterial samples, a complete plasmid genome of klebsiella pneumoniae pkf3-140 is determined, which has a circular chromosome of 147,416bp in length. among the 203 predicted genes, 142 have function assignment and about 50 appear to be involved in plasmid replication, maintenance, conjugative transfer, iron acquisition and transport, and drug resistance. extensive comparative genomic analyses revealed that pkf3-140 exhibits a rather low sequence similarity and structural conservation with other  reported k. pneumoniae plasmids. in contrast, the overall organization of pkf3-140 is highly similar to escherichia coli plasmids p1escum and puti89, which indicates the possibility that k. pneumoniae pkf3-140 may have a potential origin in e. coli. meanwhile, interestingly, several drug resistant genes show high similarity to the plasmid pu302l in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium u302  strain g8430 and the plasmid pk245 in k. pneumoniae. this mosaic pattern of sequence similarities suggests that pkf3-140 might have arisen from e. coli and acquired the resistance genes from a variety of enteric bacteria and underscores  the importance of a further understanding of horizontal gene transfer among enteric bacteria.

(russia) primers  and reagents. amplicon detection was carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis method. detection of general anti-lysozyme activity (ala) was performed by plate  method, secreted and sorption ala components - photometrically by o.v. bukharin et al. (1999) and v.yu.sokolov and a.p.luda (1987) methods, respectively. results: screening of chromosome localization genes - ivyc in escherichiae and klebsiellae and plic in salmonellae by pcr method showed their ubiquitous spread  among the studied cultures. the search for homologues of plic gene that are characteristic for k. pneumoniae virulence plasmid revealed positive result in 19 +/- 5.5% of cases. the lowest level of ala wa noted in carriers of only ivyc gene accounting for an average of 2.8 +/- 0.6 microg/mlxod, while all enterobacteria with plic gene had average ala value of 4 +/- 0.3 microg/mlxod. conclusion: anti-lysozyme activity of enterobacteria is part of the general mechanism of microorganism lysozyme resistance and is determined by the presence of secreted lysozyme inhibitor genes. application of molecular-genetic approach in the form of the developed experimental test-system based on pcr method allowed to detect secreted lysozyme inhibitor genes in screening mode. high level of secretory ala  is coupled with the presence of plic gene, while in ivyc gene carriers lower values of the attribute were detected.

TI  == chemical rescue of the post-translationally carboxylated lysine mutant of allantoinase and dihydroorotase by metal ions and short-chain carboxylic acids.
AB  == bacterial allantoinase (allase) and dihydroorotase (dhoase) are members of the cyclic amidohydrolase family. allase and dhoase possess similar binuclear metal centers in the active site in which two metals are bridged by a post-translationally carboxylated lysine. in this study, we determined the effects of carboxylated lysine and metal binding on the activities of allase and  dhoase. although dhoase is a metalloenzyme, purified dhoase showed high activity  without additional metal supplementation in a reaction mixture or bacterial culture. however, unlike dhoase, allase had no activity unless some specific metal ions were added to the reaction mixture or culture. substituting the metal  binding sites h59, h61, k146, h186, h242, or d315 with alanine completely abolished the activity of allase. however, the k146c, k146d and k146e mutants of  allase were still active with about 1-6% activity of the wild-type enzyme. these  allase k146 mutants were found to have 1.4-1.7 mol metal per mole enzyme subunit, which may indicate that they still contained the binuclear metal center in the active site. the activity of the k146a mutant of the allase and the k103a mutant  of dhoase can be chemically rescued by short-chain carboxylic acids, such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, but not by ethanol, propan-1-ol, and imidazole, in the presence of co2+ or mn2+ ions. however, the activity was still  ~10-fold less than that of wild-type allase. overall, these results indicated that the 20 natural basic amino acid residues were not sufficiently able to play  the role of lysine. accordingly, we proposed that during evolution, the post-translational modification of carboxylated lysine in the cyclic amidohydrolase family was selected for promoting binuclear metal center self-assembly and increasing the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide at the active site for enzyme catalysis. this kind of chemical rescue combined with site-directed mutagenesis may also be used to identify a binuclear metal center in the active site for other metalloenzymes.

AB  == background: bacteria employ complex transcriptional networks involving multiple genes in response to stress, which is not limited to gene and protein networks but now includes small rnas (srnas). these regulatory rna molecules are increasingly shown to be able to initiate regulatory cascades and modulate the expression of multiple genes that are involved in or required for survival under  environmental challenge. despite mounting evidence for the importance of srnas in stress response, their role upon antibiotic exposure remains unknown. in this study, we sought to determine firstly, whether differential expression of srnas occurs upon antibiotic exposure and secondly, whether these srnas could be attributed to microbial tolerance to antibiotics. results: a small scale srna cloning strategy of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 challenged with half the minimal inhibitory concentration of tigecycline identified four srnas (syj5, syj20, syj75 and syj118) which were reproducibly upregulated in the  presence of either tigecycline or tetracycline. the coding sequences of the four  srnas were found to be conserved across a number of species. genome analysis found that syj5 and syj118 mapped between the 16s and 23s rrna encoding genes. syj20 (also known as sroa) is encoded upstream of the tbpayabkyabj operon and is  classed as a riboswitch, whilst its role in antibiotic stress-response appears independent of its riboswitch function. syj75 is encoded between genes that are involved in enterobactin transport and metabolism. additionally we find that the  genetic deletion of syj20 rendered a reduced viability phenotype in the presence  of tigecycline, which was recovered when complemented. the upregulation of some of these srnas were also observed when s. typhimurium was challenged by ampicillin (syj5, 75 and 118); or when klebsiella pneumoniae was challenged by tigecycline (syj20 and 118). conclusions: small rnas are overexpressed as a result of antibiotic exposure in s. typhimurium where the same molecules are upregulated in a related species or after exposure to different antibiotics. syj20, a riboswitch, appears to possess a trans-regulatory srna role in antibiotic tolerance. these findings imply that the srna mediated response is a component of the bacterial response to antibiotic challenge.

TI  == characterization of five novel endolysins from gram-negative infecting bacteriophages.
AB  == we here characterize five globular endolysins, encoded by a set of gram-negative  infecting bacteriophages: bcepc6gp22 (burkholderia cepacia phage bcepc6b), p2gp09 (escherichia coli phage p2), psp3gp10 (salmonella enterica phage psp3), k11gp3.5  and kp32gp15 (klebsiella pneumoniae phages k11 and kp32, respectively). in silico, bcepc6gp22, p2gp10 and psp3gp10 are predicted to possess lytic transglycosylase activity, whereas k11gp3.5 and kp32gp15 have putative amidase activity. all five endolysins show muralytic activity on the peptidoglycan of several gram-negative bacterial species. in vitro, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 is clearly sensitive for the antibacterial action of the five endolysins in the presence of the outer membrane permeabilizer edta: reductions are ranging from 1.89 to 3.08 log units dependent on the endolysin. the predicted transglycosylases bcepc6gp22, p2gp10 and psp3gp10 have a substantially higher muralytic and in vitro antibacterial activity compared to the predicted amidases  k11gp3.5 and kp32gp15, highlighting the impact of the catalytic specificity on endolysin activity. furthermore, initial data exclude the synergistic lethal effect of a combination of the predicted transglycosylase psp3gp10 and the predicted amidase k11gp3.5 on pao1. as these globular endolysins show a lower enzymatic and antibacterial activity, in comparison to modular endolysins, we suggest that the latter should be favored for antibacterial applications.

TI  == receptor-independent interaction of bacterial lipopolysaccharide with lipid and lymphocyte membranes; the role of cholesterol.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a major constituent of bacterial outer membranes where it makes up the bulk of the outer leaflet and plays a key role as determinant of bacterial interactions with the host. membrane-free lps is known to activate t-lymphocytes through interactions with toll-like receptor 4 via multiprotein complexes. in the present study, we investigate the role of cholesterol and membrane heterogeneities as facilitators of receptor-independent  lps binding and insertion, which underpin bacterial interactions with the host in symbiosis, pathogenesis and cell invasion. we use fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of membrane-free lps from intestinal gram-negative organisms with cholesterol-containing model membranes and with t-lymphocytes. lps preparations from klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica were found to bind preferentially to mixed lipid membranes by comparison to pure pc bilayers. the same was observed for lps from the symbiote escherichia coli but with an order of magnitude higher dissociation constant. insertion of lps into model membranes confirmed the preference for sphingomyelin/cholesterol-containing systems. lps insertion into jurkat t-lymphocyte membranes reveals that they have  a significantly greater lps-binding capacity by comparison to methyl-beta-cyclodextrin cholesterol-depleted lymphocyte membranes, albeit at slightly lower binding rates.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of salmonella enterica serovar typhi in kolkata, india, and in vitro experiments on effect of combined chemotherapy.
AB  == this communication states the changing patterns of salmonella enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi) isolates causing enteric fever in and around kolkata, india. among the isolates resistance to ampicillin (a), chloramphenicol (c), cotrimoxazole (co) and tetracycline (t) were plasmid mediated; the plasmid was unstable in s. typhi, and the other enteric bacteria like escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris were found to be the potential source  of dissemination of such plasmids into s. typhi. the infection with such s. typhi strains were successfully treated with ciprofloxacin (cp: mics 0.0075-0.075 mug ml(-)(1)) and/or ofloxacin (ofx: mics 0.0125-0.075 mug ml(-)(1)), but in the later course, the s. typhi strains, showing resistance to nalidixic acid, developed low level of resistance to cp and ofx, causing the treatment failure. thus, the treatment regimen was shifted to the third generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone (ct) and cefotaxime (cf). keeping in mind the anticipation of development of resistance to ct/cf, we prepared the treatment regimen for mdr enteric fever, based on the double-drug synergy tests in vitro; cp-gentamycin (fici 0.121-0.216) and cp-trimethoprim (fici 0.14-0.483) combinations were found  effective against s. typhi isolates having decreased sensitivity to cp (mics: 0.5-1.25 mug ml(-)(1)).

TI  == c1 inhibitor suppresses the endotoxic activity of a wide range of lipopolysaccharides and interacts with live gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == human c1 inhibitor (c1inh) prevents endotoxin shock via a direct interaction with gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and improves survival in animal  models of sepsis. in this report, we further characterize the interaction of c1inh with lps and whole live bacteria. we investigate c1inh interactions with lps from five different strains of gram-negative enteric bacteria known to participate in the pathogenesis of human sepsis. treatment with c1inh improved survival in mice with endotoxin shock induced by lps from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as previously shown, as well as lps from escherichia coli o55:b5 and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a trend to improved survival was observed  when klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens lps were used. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shift experiments demonstrated a direct interaction of c1inh with lps from all the strains studied. the binding of both native and reactive center-cleaved, inactive c1inh results in inhibition of lps-induced proinflammatory cytokine production. furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of c1inh to bind at the surface of only a restricted number of whole live gram-negative bacteria as well as mutant bacteria expressing a truncated lps lacking the o-antigen. these data reveal the interaction of c1inh with a wide range of enteric bacterial lps and strongly suggest that the interaction between c1inh and the surface of gram-negative microorganisms is determined by the length of the polysaccharide chain of the endotoxin molecule.

AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == changes in transcriptional orientation are associated with increases in evolutionary rates of enterobacterial genes.
AB  == background: changes in transcriptional orientation ("ctos") occur frequently in prokaryotic genomes. such changes usually result from genomic inversions, which may cause a conflict between the directions of replication and transcription and  an increase in mutation rate. however, ctos do not always lead to the replication-transcription confrontation. furthermore, ctos may cause deleterious  disruptions of operon structure and/or gene regulations. the currently existing ctos may indicate relaxation of selection pressure. therefore, it is of interest  to investigate whether ctos have an independent effect on the evolutionary rates  of the affected genes, and whether these genes are subject to any type of selection pressure in prokaryotes. methods: three closely related enterbacteria,  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, were selected for comparisons of synonymous (ds) and nonsynonymous (dn) substitution rate between the genes that have experienced changes in transcriptional orientation (changed-orientation genes, "cogs") and those that do not (same-orientation genes, "sogs"). the dn/ds ratio was also derived to evaluate the selection pressure on the analyzed genes. confounding factors in the estimation of evolutionary rates, such as gene essentiality, gene expression level, replication-transcription confrontation, and decreased ds at gene terminals were controlled in the cog-sog comparisons. results: we demonstrate that cogs have significantly higher dn and ds than sogs when a series of confounding factors are controlled. however, the dn/ds ratios are similar between the two gene groups, suggesting that the increase in ds can sufficiently explain  the increase in dn in cogs. therefore, the increases in evolutionary rates in cogs may be mainly mutation-driven. conclusions: here we show that ctos can increase the evolutionary rates of the affected genes. this effect is independent of the replication-transcription confrontation, which is suggested to be the major cause of inversion-associated evolutionary rate increases. the real cause of such evolutionary rate increases remains unclear but is worth further explorations.

TI  == engineering genetically encoded nanosensors for real-time in vivo measurements of citrate concentrations.
AB  == citrate is an intermediate in catabolic as well as biosynthetic pathways and is an important regulatory molecule in the control of glycolysis and lipid metabolism. mass spectrometric and nmr based metabolomics allow measuring citrate concentrations, but only with limited spatial and temporal resolution. methods are so far lacking to monitor citrate levels in real-time in-vivo. here, we present a series of genetically encoded citrate sensors based on forster resonance energy transfer (fret). we screened databases for citrate-binding proteins and tested three candidates in vitro. the citrate binding domain of the  klebsiella pneumoniae histidine sensor kinase cita, inserted between the fret pair venus/cfp, yielded a sensor highly specific for citrate. we optimized the peptide linkers to achieve maximal fret change upon citrate binding. by modifying residues in the citrate binding pocket, we were able to construct seven sensors with different affinities spanning a concentration range of three orders of magnitude without losing specificity. in a first in vivo application we show that e. coli maintains the capacity to take up glucose or acetate within seconds even  after long-term starvation.

TI  == the role of p-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) in bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal cells.
AB  == background and aims: active efflux proteins such as p-glycoprotein (p-gp) are thought to have a protective role in the intestinal tract by preventing xenotoxin absorption. some bacteria also need to adhere to the intestinal tract before causing disease through adhesin secretion. thus, this study was initiated to examine whether any association exists between bacterial adhesion. methods: three human cell lines (caco2, rko, and mcf7), and 6 species of bacteria were used in this study (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium sporogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa). following incubation of our cells with active efflux inhibitors, bacteria incubated with a stable fluorescent dye were co-incubated at 37 degrees c for various times up to 240min. fluorescence intensity was used to compare bacterial  attachment to these cell lines with either normal efflux protein expression or with induction or inhibition of efflux proteins. results: p-gp inhibition by either psc-833 or gf120918 resulted in a significant increase of all bacterial attachment to caco2 cells up to 3 fold. rko cells and mcf7 cells did not alter their bacterial attachment with psc-833. fumitremorgen c, a dedicated bcrp inhibitor had no effect. in addition, rifampicin, a p-gp inducer, resulted in some limited reduction in salmonella and klebsiella attachment only. conclusions: these results indicate p-gp expression may contribute to the resistance of potential bacterial toxicity, by preventing them adhering to human enterocytes cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which may reduce the risk or intensity of gastrointestinal disorders.

AB  == gram-negative bacteria (gnb) cause common and severe hospital- and community-acquired infections with a high incidence of multidrug resistance (mdr) and mortality. the emergence and spread of mdr-gnb strains limit therapeutic options and highlight the need to develop new therapeutic strategies. in this study, the peptide (rxr)(4)xb- and (kff)(3)k-conjugated peptide nucleic acids (ppnas) were developed to target rpod, which encodes an rna polymerase primary sigma(70) that is thought to be essential for bacterial growth. their antimicrobial activities were tested against different clinical isolates of mdr-gnb in vitro and in infection models. the (rxr)(4)xb- and (kff)(3)k- conjugated pnas were bactericidal against different strains of mdr-gnb in concentration-dependent and sequence-selective manner, whereas a ppna with a scrambled base sequence had no effect on growth. among tested ppnas, (rxr)(4)xb conjugate ppna06 showed more potent and broad spectrum inhibition in multidrug-resistant escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, and shigella flexneri in vitro and in vivo. the results were associated with suppression of rpod mrna and sigma(70) expression, as well as sigma(70) downstream regulated genes including ftsz, mazf, prfb, rpos, seqa, turfb and ygjd. the treatment of ppna06 on mono- or multiple mdr-gbn infected human gastric mucosal epithelial cells demonstrated the complete inhibition on bacterial growth and no influence on morphology and growth of human cells. also, ppna06 did not show the induction of antibiotic resistance as compared with classical antibiotics in gnb. these findings firstly demonstrate that rpod is potential target for developing antisense antibiotics, and indicate that peptide conjugates of anti-rpod pna are active against gnbs in vitro and in vivo. our results offer  a feasible strategy for treating mdr-gnb infections.

TI  == essential oils from moroccan plants as potential chemosensitisers restoring antibiotic activity in resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial drug resistance is a worrying public health problem. antibiotic efflux  is a major non-specific resistance mechanism used by bacteria, and efflux pumps are involved in the low-level susceptibility of various important gram-negative pathogens. use of molecules that can block bacterial pumps is an attractive strategy, but several studies report only partial efficacy owing to limits of these molecules (stability, selectivity, bioavailability, toxicity, etc.). the objective of this study was to search for natural sources of molecules able to inhibit efflux pump systems of resistant gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa). the results indicate that the studied essential oils exhibit interesting activity against the tested bacteria. this activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor such as phenylalanine arginyl beta-naphthylamide (pabetan). the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) structure in the effect of essential oils was also reported in salmonella lps deep-rough mutants. in addition, essential oils of thymus maroccanus and thymus broussonetii, used at a low concentration (a fraction of the minimum inhibitory concentration), are able to significantly increase chloramphenicol susceptibility of several resistant isolates. these results demonstrate that these essential oils can alter efflux pump activity and  may be attractive candidates to develop new drugs for chemosensitising multidrug-resistant strains to clinically used antibiotics.

TI  == altering the composition of caseicins a and b as a means of determining the contribution of specific residues to antimicrobial activity.
AB  == caseicin a (ikhqglpqe) and caseicin b (vlnenllr) are antimicrobial peptides generated through the bacterial fermentation of sodium caseinate, and on the basis of this and previous studies, they are active against many gram-negative pathogens (cronobacter sakazakii, cronobacter muytjensii, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas fluorescens) as well as the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus. here we describe further studies with the aim of establishing the importance of specific  (charged and nonpolar aliphatic) residues within the caseicin peptides and the effects that they have on the bacteria listed above. in order to achieve our objective, we created four derivatives of each caseicin (a1 to a4 and b1 to b4) in which specific residues were altered, and results obtained with these derivatives were compared to wild-type caseicin activity. although conversion of  cationic residues to alanine in caseicins b1 (r8a change), a1 (k2a), a2 (h3a), and a3 (k2a-h3a) generally resulted in their activity against microbial targets being reduced or unaltered, c. sakazakii dpc6440 was unusual in that it displayed enhanced sensitivity to three peptides (caseicins a1, a3, and b2) in which positively charged residues had been eliminated. while the replacement of leucine with alanine in selected variants (b3 and b4) resulted in reduced activity against a number of strains of cronobacter and, in some cases, s. typhimurium, these changes enhanced the activities of these peptides against dpc6440 and a number of s. aureus strains. it is thus apparent that the importance of specific  residues within the caseicin peptides is dependent on the strain being targeted.

AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == a report from the 20th european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious  diseases (april 10-13, 2010 - vienna, austria).
AB  == effective antimicrobials currently in use in europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the european congress of  clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (eccmid). as extensively discussed  in an oral session entitled worldwide dissemination of resistances by 10 specialists from across europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (roede, b.m. et al., abst o127; huenger, f. et al., abst o395; mera, r.m. et al., abst o483). while many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals  and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (derde, l. et al., abst o464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the austria center in vienna. the war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. treatments of the diseases  caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by  new research and population surveys. however, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.

TI  == l-glutamine as a nitrogen source for corynebacterium glutamicum: derepression of  the amtr regulon and implications for nitrogen sensing.
AB  == corynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive soil bacterium employed in the industrial production of various amino acids, is able to use a number of different nitrogen sources, such as ammonium, urea or creatinine. this study shows that l-glutamine serves as an excellent nitrogen source for c. glutamicum and allows similar growth rates in glucose minimal medium to those in ammonium. a transcriptome comparison revealed that the nitrogen starvation response was elicited when glutamine served as the sole nitrogen source, meaning that the target genes of the global nitrogen regulator amtr were derepressed. subsequent growth experiments with a variety of mutants defective in nitrogen metabolism showed that glutamate synthase is crucial for glutamine utilization, while a putative glutaminase is dispensable under the experimental conditions used. the gltbd operon encoding the glutamate synthase is a member of the amtr regulon. the observation that the nitrogen starvation response was elicited at high intracellular l-glutamine levels has implications for nitrogen sensing. in contrast with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae, a drop in glutamine concentration obviously does not serve as a nitrogen starvation signal in c. glutamicum.

TI  == the omptins of yersinia pestis and salmonella enterica cleave the reactive center loop of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1.
AB  == plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (pai-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) and a key molecule that regulates fibrinolysis by inactivating human plasminogen  activators. here we show that two important human pathogens, the plague bacterium yersinia pestis and the enteropathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, inactivate pai-1 by cleaving the r346-m347 bait peptide bond in the reactive center loop. no cleavage of pai-1 was detected with yersinia pseudotuberculosis,  an oral/fecal pathogen from which y. pestis has evolved, or with escherichia coli. the cleavage and inactivation of pai-1 were mediated by the outer membrane  proteases plasminogen activator pla of y. pestis and pgte protease of s. enterica, which belong to the omptin family of transmembrane endopeptidases identified in gram-negative bacteria. cleavage of pai-1 was also detected with the omptins epo of erwinia pyrifoliae and kop of klebsiella pneumoniae, which both belong to the same omptin subfamily as pla and pgte, whereas no cleavage of  pai-1 was detected with omptins of shigella flexneri or e. coli or the yersinia chromosomal omptins, which belong to other omptin subfamilies. the results reveal a novel serpinolytic mechanism by which enterobacterial species expressing omptins of the pla subfamily bypass normal control of host proteolysis.

TI  == engineering of glycerol dehydrogenase for improved activity towards 1, 3-butanediol.
AB  == the objective of this study was to use protein engineering techniques to enhance  the catalytic activity of glycerol dehydrogenase (glydh) on racemic 1, 3-butanediol (1, 3-bdo) for the bioproduction of the important pharmaceutical intermediate 4-hydroxy-2-butanone. three glydh genes (glda) from escherichia coli k-12, salmonella enterica, and klebsiella pneumoniae mgh78578 were shuffled to generate a random mutagenesis library. the nitroblue tetrazolium/phenazine methosulfate high throughput screening protocol was used to select four chimeric  enzymes with up to a 2.6-fold improved activity towards 1, 3-bdo. a rational design method was also employed to further improve the enzyme activity after dna  shuffling. based on the homology model of glydh (escherichia coli), asp121 was predicted to influence 1, 3-bdo binding and replaced with ala by site-directed mutagenesis. combination of the mutations from both dna shuffling and rational design produced the best mutant with a v (max) value of 126.6 u/mg, a 26-fold activity increase compared with that of the wild type glydh from e. coli.

TI  == chromosomally encoded blacmy-2 located on a novel sxt/r391-related integrating conjugative element in a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  == integrating conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. although sxt/r391-related  ices, originally demonstrated in vibrio cholerae o139 isolates, have become prevalent among v. cholerae isolates in asia, the prevalence of the ices among gram-negative bacteria other than vibrio spp. remains unknown. in addition, sxt/r391-related ices carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. here we carried out a genetic analysis  of a cefoxitin-resistant proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, tum4660, which revealed the presence of a novel sxt/r391-related ice, icepmijpn1. icepmijpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of r391 and carried xis  and int genes completely identical to those of r391, while an is10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(cmy-2) was integrated into the ice. a nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of isecp1 was located upstream of the bla(cmy-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(cmy-2) in earlier studies were also present. furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in icepmijpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in sxt(mo10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in p. mirabilis atcc 29906, respectively. icepmijpn1 was successfully transferred to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. these observations suggest that ices may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ices, including sxt/r391-related ices.

TI  == substitution of the arginine/leucine residues in apidaecin ib with peptoid residues: effect on antimicrobial activity, cellular uptake, and proteolytic degradation.
AB  == several aspects of the mechanism of action of pro-rich antimicrobial peptides, together with their low toxicity in mammalian cells, make them good candidates for the development of new antibiotic agents. we investigated the effect induced  in the insect antimicrobial peptide apidaecin ib by the replacement of a single arginine/leucine residue with a n-substituted glycine. the resulting peptoid-peptide hybrids are more resistant to proteolysis and devoid of any significant cytotoxic activity, but moving the [narg]residue from the n- to the c-terminal end of the molecule progressively reduces the antibacterial activity.  cell uptake experiments in e. coli cells suggest that the loss of antibacterial activity of [narg(17)]apidaecin is a consequence of its inability to translocate  into bacterial cells. conversely, apidaecin and its peptoid-peptide hybrids are able to cross the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells and to diffuse in the cytosol, although their translocating ability is far less effective than that of  other known cell permeant peptides.

TI  == the cyclotide cycloviolacin o2 from viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. methods: prototypic cyclotides, including the mobius kalata b1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin o2 (cyo2), were isolated using reversed-phase hplc. initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (rdas) and mic assays with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. for  the most active peptide, cyo2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. charged residues in cyo2 were  chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. results: cyo2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli in rdas and mic assays, while the other peptides were less active. in time-kill assays, cyo2 also had bactericidal  activity against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. in contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against s. aureus. chemical masking of the charged glu and lys residues in cyo2 caused a near total loss of activity against salmonella, while masking arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. conclusions: cyo2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the charged residues in cyo2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. in combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyo2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.

TI  == asymmetrical distribution of the second messenger c-di-gmp upon bacterial cell division.
AB  == the bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-gmp) regulates cellular motility and the synthesis of organelles and molecules that promote adhesion to a variety of biological and nonbiological surfaces. these properties likely require tight spatial and temporal regulation of c-di-gmp concentration. we have developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret)-based biosensors to monitor c-di-gmp concentrations within single bacterial cells by microscopy. fluctuations of c-di-gmp were visualized in diverse gram-negative bacterial species and observed to be cell cycle dependent.  asymmetrical distribution of c-di-gmp in the progeny correlated with the time of  cell division and polarization for caulobacter crescentus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, asymmetrical distribution of c-di-gmp was observed as part of cell division, which may indicate an important regulatory step in extracellular organelle biosynthesis or function.

TI  == production and immunogenicity of recombinant ferric enterobactin protein (fepa).
AB  == objectives: ferric siderophore complexes are produced by most bacteria to acquire iron, a vital element. these complexes are transported across the outer membrane  by receptor proteins commonly known as fepa (ferric enterobactin protein). in this study we attempted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the membrane protein fepa, aiming at inhibition of iron uptake to protect invasion of the host by the  bacterium. methods: the genomic fepa gene was amplified from escherichia coli o157:h7. the pcr product was ligated into pet28a and was then expressed in e. coli bl21(de3). the recombinant protein purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid  (ni-nta) affinity chromatography was injected into balb/c mice to induce immunity. antibody titer was determined by elisa. mouse groups were challenged with various doses of e. coli o157:h7, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and salmonella typhi to study immune response. results: an 85-kda recombinant protein was expressed and purified. immunogenicity of the recombinant protein was determined by injecting balb/c mice. the antibody produced therein could efficiently recognize and bind ferric enterobactin binding protein. immunized mice challenged with higher doses of selected bacteria survived. conclusions: significant recognition by the antibody of ferric enterobactin binding protein may lead to its application in the restriction of enterobacteriaceae propagation.

TI  == the designer proline-rich antibacterial peptide a3-apo is effective against systemic escherichia coli infections in different mouse models.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are considered to be viable alternatives to conventional antibiotics. however, they rarely show systemic efficacy in animal models when added at non-toxic doses. the dimer a3-apo was designed to attack both the bacterial membrane and the enterobacteriaceae-specific domain of the heat shock protein dnak in order to reduce toxicity whilst maintaining activity. the peptide exhibited a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 2-128 mg/l against 28 clinical escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium strains, with a median mic of 30 mg/l. at this concentration, a3-apo  was bactericidal to e. coli 5770, a fluoroquinolone-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strain. the no observed adverse effect limit (noael) at  repeated intraperitoneal peptide administration was 20mg/kg. when administered at this dose three times starting immediately after e. coli neumann infection, a3-apo cured 100% of mice in a standard bacteraemia model used by the pharmaceutical industry. in a more stringent assay, when treatment started after  e. coli 5770 bacteraemia had already been established, three doses of 10mg/kg a3-apo prolonged early survival at a rate similar to that of imipenem and reduced the bacterial counts to base level. when the second assay was repeated in kidney  clearance conditions resembling those in humans, 10mg/kg a3-apo was as efficacious as imipenem in the long-term. the increased in vivo efficacy compared with the in vitro bactericidal figures can potentially be explained by the generally observable immunostimulatory properties of antimicrobial peptides. peptide a3-apo shows promising features as a member in our antibiotic arsenal against multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == the phev phenylalanine trna gene klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates is an integration hotspot for possible niche-adaptation genomic islands.
AB  == horizontally acquired genomic islands may allow bacteria to conquer and colonize  previously uncharted niches. four klebsiella pneumoniae trna gene insertion hotspots (arg6, asn34, met56, and phev) in 101 clinical isolates derived from blood, sputum, wound, bile or urine specimens were screened by long-range pcr for the presence or absence of integrated islands. the phev phenylalanine trna gene was the most frequently occupied site and harbored at least three entirely distinct types of islands: (1) kpgi-1, a 3.7 kb island coding for four proteins,  three of which showed high similarity to two hypothetical proteins and a gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase in salmonella enterica, (2) kpgi-2, a 6.4 kb island coding for five proteins including a truncated phage-like integrase, two helicase-related proteins, and a homolog of the functionally elusive fic protein, and (3) kpgi-3, a 12.6 kb island which carried seven fimbriae-related genes, first identified in mgh78578. consistent with the niche-adaptation hypothesis, kpgi-1-like islands which coded for the putative acetyltransferase were significantly over-represented in sputum isolates as compared to urine (p < 0.001), blood (p < 0.05) or bile (p < 0.05) derived isolates. despite the unique  nature of kpgi-2, likely homologs of orf5_kpgi-2 that coded for fic were also found at undefined locations in six other clinical isolates, though none possessed the other kpgi-2 genes. we propose that the phev-associated islands described in this study may contribute to fine tuning and adaptation of k. pneumoniae strains toward preferred infection and/or colonization pathways.

TI  == planktonic and biofilm communities from 7-day-old chicken cecal microflora cultures: characterization and resistance to salmonella colonization.
AB  == information implicating bacterial biofilms as contributory factors in the development of environmental bacterial resistance has been increasing. there is a lack of information regarding the role of biofilms within the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract of food animals. this work used a continuous-flow chemostat model derived from the ceca of 7-day-old chicks to characterize these communities and their ability to neutralize invasion by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. we characterized and compared the biofilm and planktonic communities within these microcosms using automated ribotyping and the analytical profile index biotyping system. eleven species from eight different genera were identified from six culture systems. klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from all  planktonic communities and four of the biofilm communities. three of the communities resisted colonization by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, two communities suppressed growth, and one community succumbed to colonization. in cultures that resisted colonization, no salmonella could be isolated from the biofilm; in cultures that succumbed to colonization, salmonella was consistently  found within the biofilms. this study was one of a series that provided a molecular-based characterization of both the biofilm and planktonic communities from continuous-flow culture systems derived from the cecal microflora of chicks, ranging in age from day-of-hatch to 14 days old. the one common factor relating to successful colonization of the culture was the presence of salmonella within the biofilm. the capacity to sequester the introduced salmonella into the biofilm appears to be a contributing factor to the inability of these cultures to withstand colonization by the salmonella.

TI  == genomic diversity of citrate fermentation in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == background: it has long been recognized that klebsiella pneumoniae can grow anaerobically on citrate. genes responsible for citrate fermentation of k. pneumoniae were known to be located in a 13-kb gene cluster on the chromosome. by whole genome comparison of the available k. pneumoniae sequences (mgh 78578, 342, and ntuh-k2044), however, we discovered that the fermentation gene cluster was present in mgh 78578 and 342, but absent in ntuh-k2044. in the present study, the previously unknown genome diversity of citrate fermentation among k. pneumoniae clinical isolates was investigated. results: using a genomic microarray containing probe sequences from multiple k. pneumoniae strains, we investigated genetic diversity among k. pneumoniae clinical isolates and found that a genomic  region containing the citrate fermentation genes was not universally present in all strains. we confirmed by pcr analysis that the gene cluster was detectable in about half of the strains tested. to demonstrate the metabolic function of the genomic region, anaerobic growth of k. pneumoniae in artificial urine medium (aum) was examined for ten strains with different clinical histories and genomic  backgrounds, and the citrate fermentation potential was found correlated with the genomic region. pcr detection of the genomic region yielded high positive rates among a variety of clinical isolates collected from urine, blood, wound infection, and pneumonia. conserved genetic organizations in the vicinity of the  citrate fermentation gene clusters among k. pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and  escherichia coli suggest that the 13-kb genomic region were not independently acquired. conclusion: not all, but nearly half of the k. pneumoniae clinical isolates carry the genes responsible for anaerobic growth on citrate. genomic variation of citrate fermentation genes in k. pneumoniae may contribute to metabolic diversity and adaptation to variable nutrient conditions in different environments.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of a new cefixime-clavulanic acid combination for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  == bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. to focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in caco-2bbe and nci-h292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and  transmission electron microscopy revealed that staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of shigella sonnei, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae particles. endocytosed staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for yersinia, suggesting that  cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. interestingly,  when staphylococcus and yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of nci-h292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked  uptake of both yersinia and staphylococcus in nci-h292 and caco-2bbe cells. our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  == interleukin-17 in host defence against bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  == the mammalian immune system is intricately regulated, allowing for potent pathogen-specific immunity to be rapidly activated in response to infection with  a broad and diverse array of potential pathogens. as a result of their ability to differentiate into distinct effector lineages, cd4 t cells significantly contribute to pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. through the production of effector cytokines, cd4 t helper (th) cells orchestrate the precise mobilization of specific immune cells to eradicate infection. the protective effects of the newly identified lineage of th17 cells against pathogens like klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter rodentium and candida albicans indicate the capacity of th17 cells to confer protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, filling a critical void in host immunity not covered by the classically described th1 lineage that activates immunity to intracellular pathogens or the th2 lineage that is important in protection against mucosal parasitic pathogens. host defence by th17 cells extends beyond protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal pathogens, as demonstrated in infections against intracellular bacteria like listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enterica, as well as mycobacterium tuberculosis. herein, we summarize both experimental data from mouse infection models and epidemiological studies in humans that demonstrate the protective effects of interleukin-17 and th17 cd4 t cells in immunity to bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal pathogens.

AB  == the current study determined the spectrum of biliary microflora with special emphasis on enteric fever organisms in patients with acute cholangitis with and without cholelithiasis or other biliary diseases. the patients were divided into  three groups: group a consisted of patients with acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis; group b consisted of patients with acute cholecystitis with gastrointestinal ailments requiring biliary drainage and group c consisted of patients with gallbladder carcinoma. gallbladder, bile and gallstones were subjected to complete microbiological and histopathological examination. antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was performed as per clsi guidelines. bacteria were recovered from 17 samples (32%) in group a, 17 (51.4%)  in group b and 1 (1.6%) in group c. the most common organisms isolated were escherichia coli (11, 29.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10, 27%), citrobacter freundii (3, 8.1%), salmonella enterica serovar typhi (3, 8.1%), etc. the majority of enterobacteriaceae isolates were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem. as regards salmonella spp., s. typhi was isolated from 2 (3.8%) patients in group a and 1 (16%) in group c. antimicrobial  susceptibility of potential causative organisms, the severity of the cholecystitis, and the local susceptibility pattern must be taken into consideration when prescribing drugs. a protocol regarding the management of such cases should be formulated based on observations of similar studies.

TI  == membrane permeability and regulation of drug "influx and efflux" in enterobacterial pathogens.
AB  == in enterobacteriaceae, membrane permeability is a key in the level of susceptibility to antibiotics. modification of the bacterial envelope by decreasing the porin production or increasing the expression of efflux pump systems has been reported. these phenomena are frequently associated with other resistance mechanisms such as alteration of antibiotics or modification of the drug targets, in various clinical isolates showing a multi drug resistant phenotype (mdr). in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica several genes and external factors are involved in the emergence of mdr isolates. these bacterial isolates exhibit a noticeable reduction of functional porins per cell due to a decrease, a complete  shutdown of synthesis, or the expression of an altered porin and a high expression of efflux systems (e.g. overexpression of the pump). the combined action of these mechanisms during an infection confers a significant decrease in  bacterial sensitivity to antibiotherapy ensuring dissemination and colonization of the patient and favours the acquisition of additional mechanisms of resistance. mara and rama are involved in a complex regulation cascade controlling membrane permeability and actively participate in the triggering of the mdr phenotype. mutations in regulator genes have been shown to induce the overproduction of efflux and the down-regulation of porin synthesis. in addition, various compounds such as salicylate, imipenem or chloramphenicol are able to activate the mdr response. this phenomenon has been observed both in vitro during culture of bacteria in the presence of drugs and in vivo during antibiotic treatment of infected patients. these effectors activate the expression of specific global regulators, mara, rama, or target other genes located downstream  in the regulation cascade.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

AB  == two octanordammaranes, mansumbinone (1) and 3,4-seco-mansumbinoic acid (2), and two sesquiterpenes, beta-elemene (3) and t-cadinol (4) have been isolated from the oleo-resin of commiphora molmol (engl.). the structures of these compounds were established unambiguously by a series of 1d and 2d-nmr analyses. we have also unambiguously assigned all (1)h and (13)c nmr resonances for 2 and revised its (13)c data. the crude extract of the oleo-resin of c. molmol displayed potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline against s. aureus, several salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains and two k. pneumoniae strains. the antibacterial activity of terpenes 1-4 was determined against a number of staphylococcus aureus strains: sa1199b, atcc25923, xu212, rn4220 and emrsa15 and  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be in the range of 4-256 microg/ml. the highest activity was observed by the seco-a-ring octanordammarane 2 with an mic of 4 microg/ml against sa1199b, a multidrug-resistant strain which over-expresses the nora efflux transporter, the  major characterized antibiotic pump in this species. this activity compared favorably to the antibiotic norfloxacin with an mic of 32 microg/ml. compound 2 also displayed weak potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline activity against strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 and l10.

TI  == probing structure-activity relationships in bactericidal peptide betapep-25.
AB  == cationic peptides, known to disrupt bacterial membranes, are being developed as promising agents for therapeutic intervention against infectious disease. in the  present study, we investigate structure-activity relationships in the bacterial membrane disruptor betapep-25, a peptide 33-mer. for insight into which amino acid residues are functionally important, we synthesized alanine-scanning variants of betapep-25 and assessed their ability to kill bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus) and to neutralize lps (lipopolysaccharide). activity profiles were found to vary with the bacterial strain examined. specific cationic and smaller hydrophobic alkyl residues were crucial to optimal bactericidal activity against the gram-negative bacteria, whereas larger hydrophobic and cationic residues mediated optimal activity against gram-positive staph. aureus. lysine-substituted norleucine (n-butyl group) variants demonstrated that both charge and alkyl chain length mediate optimal activity. in terms of lps neutralization, activity profiles were essentially the same against four species of lps (e. coli 055 and 0111, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae), and different for two others (ps. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens), with specific  hydrophobic, cationic and, surprisingly, anionic residues being functionally important. furthermore, disulfide-bridged analogues demonstrated that an anti parallel beta-sheet structure is the bioactive conformation of betapep-25 in terms of its bactericidal, but not lps endotoxin neutralizing, activity. moreover, betapep-25 variants, like the parent peptide, do not lyse eukaryotic cells. this research contributes to the development and design of novel antibiotics.

TI  == investigation of four (99m)tc-labeled bacteriophages for infection-specific imaging.
AB  == introduction: this study investigated radiolabeled bacteriophages for specific detection of infection through gamma imaging. previously, a (99m)tc-labeled m13 phage demonstrated specific binding for its host escherichia coli in vitro and in mice through imaging. methods: this study was extended to phages p22, e79, vd-13  and phage 60. each was radiolabeled with (99m)tc using the chelator mag(3), and were evaluated for binding to host and non-host bacteria in vitro and in a mouse  infection model. results: in vitro, each (99m)tc-phage bound to its host at least 4-fold higher than to non-host bacteria. for example, (99m)tc-e79 showed 10- to 20-fold greater binding to host pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to non-host escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, and (99m)tc-phage 60 showed 20-fold greater binding to host klebsiella pneumoniae over non-hosts. mice received host  or non-host bacteria in one thigh, and 3 h later, the (99m)tc-phages were administered intravenously. after a further 3 h, the tissues were counted. liver  accumulation was highest for (99m)tc-e79, averaging 39% compared to an average of 13% for the other (99m)tc-phages. animals infected with host bacteria showed infected thigh/normal thigh ratios of 14.2 for (99m)tc-e79, 2.9 for (99m)tc-p22,  3.5 for (99m)tc-vd-13 and 2.1 for (99m)tc-phage 60. conclusions: although specific host binding was observed in vitro for each of these four (99m)tc-phages, only (99m)tc-e79 showed specificity for its host in an in vivo model.

AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae are an increasing problem in human medicine and an emerging problem in the veterinary field. our study, therefore, focused on assessing the prevalence of beta-lactamases isolated from swine. sixty-six salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), 33 salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis), 26 klebsiella pneumonia (k. pneumoniae) and 130 escherichia coli (e. coli) pig isolates collected from 1999-2006 were screened for beta-lactam resistance by the disk diffusion test (ddt) and micro-broth dilution. among the isolates, five e. coli and five k. pneumoniae exhibited reduced susceptibility to the cephalosporins tested. pcr, plasmid profiling and southern blot hybridization showed the presence of multiple beta-lactamases in these isolates of animal origin. hybridization patterns of the dha-1 specific probe indicated that dissemination of dha-1 related beta-lactamases could be attributed to plasmids of one common size among the enteric microbes of animal origin. to the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first identification of shv-28 and dha-1 from microbes of animal origin.

TI  == analogous oligo-acyl-lysines with distinct antibacterial mechanisms.
AB  == bactericidal properties were recently shown to emerge from hydrophobicity and charge buildup in oligo-acyl-lysine (oak) peptide mimetics. toward understanding  the attributes that govern the activity of this novel antimicrobial system, we compared the functional and mechanistic properties of a known octamer and a newly generated hexamer analog. the data provide strong evidence for multiple similarities that included high tissue stability, low hemolysis, large-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro, and the ability to prevent escherichia coli-induced mortality in vivo. despite these similarities, however, the octamer  mode of action involved membrane disruption, unlike the hexamer, which acted predominantly through inhibition of dna functions with characteristically slower  bactericidal kinetics. collectively, the data support the view that the analogous oaks induced bacterial death by distinct mechanisms and further suggest that relatively minor differences in the sequence of host defense peptides are responsible for selecting one mechanism over another, possibly in conjunction with differential binding affinities to the external and/or cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pola52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == invasiveness and intracellular growth of multidrug-resistant salmonella and other pathogens in caco-2 cells.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens of human and animal origins is a major public health concern. for a better understanding of the health consequences of multidrug-resistant bacteria transmitted from animal products to  humans, the host interaction of zoonotic salmonella isolates along with other pathogenic and commensal bacteria was evaluated using a human intestinal caco-2 cell system. multidrug-resistant s. agona, s. heidelberg, and s. typhimurium possessed plasmid-mediated class 1 integrons. the s. typhimurium dt104 isolate from ground beef showed the well-known genotypic and phenotypic resistance characteristics of the species, and contained the chromosomally located class 1 integron. among the multidrug-resistant salmonella isolates, the s. heidelberg 219 had the highest invasion number at 1.0 x 10(4) cfu/ml, followed by the s. typhimurium dt104 isolate at 7.7 x 10(3) cfu/ml. listeria monocytogenes was the best performer among the tested species in invading the caco-2 cell. multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also able to invade the cells. the invasion of s. heidelberg 219, s. typhimurium dt104, l. monocytogenes, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa into the caco-2 cells was not affected even in the presence of commensal e. coli. during the intracellular growth of s. heidelberg 219, s. typhimurium dt104, and l. monocytogenes, the bacterial counts increased 2 log cycles in 9 h in the caco-2 cells. therefore, these strains could rapidly proliferate after their invasion into the cells.

AB  == ctx-m-3 is the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase produced by enterobacteriaceae in taiwan. the present study was conducted to characterise the genetic environment surrounding bla(ctx-m-3). a total of 11 ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were studied: escherichia coli (n=4), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=5) and salmonella enterica serotypes anatum (sa831r) and potsdam (sc72). molecular methods used included polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, dna-dna hybridisation, conjugation, physical mapping and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis. all isolates examined carried bla(ctx-m-3) on large plasmids (>70kb). the resistance plasmids of the two salmonella and two k. pneumoniae strains (kp104 and kp116) were confirmed to be conjugative in vitro. rflp analysis indicated that the plasmids were different. physical mapping also revealed the difference between the two salmonella plasmids, psa831r (82kb) and psc72 (74kb). an insertion sequence, isecp1, was found upstream of each bla(ctx-m-3) gene. however, sequencing of downstream regions of the bla genes showed two different patterns: the presence of orf477 in psa831r and of orf1-muca in psc72, pkp104 and pkp116. inci1-type orit and nika sequences were present in the plasmids of all the clinical isolates tested, except s. anatum. different bla(ctx-m-3)-carrying plasmids were identified among the enterobacteria studied.  the presence of isecp1 in all isolates may be associated with the widespread resistance among enterobacteriaceae. although the plasmids were not identical, they appeared to belong to the same incompatibility group (inci1-like plasmids),  suggesting that they are genetically related but may have evolved divergently over time.

AB  == a plasmid containing the qnrs quinolone resistance determinant and the gene encoding the shv-2 beta-lactamase has been discovered from a clinical klebsiella  pneumoniae strain isolated in taiwan. the complete 98-kb sequence of this plasmid, designated pk245, was determined by using a whole-genome shotgun approach. transfer of pk245 conferred low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in electroporant escherichia coli epi300. the sequence of the immediate region surrounding qnrs in pk245 is nearly identical (>99% identity) to those of pah0376 from shigella flexneri and pinf5 from salmonella enterica serovar infantis, the two other qnrs-carrying plasmids reported to date, indicating a potential common  origin. other genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (aacc2, stra, and strb), chloramphenicol (cata2), sulfonamides (sul2), tetracycline (tetd), and trimethoprim (dfra14) were also detected in pk245. the dfra14 gene is carried on  a class i integron. several features of this plasmid, including three separate regions containing putative replicons, a partitioning-control system, and a type  ii restriction modification system, suggest that it may be able to replicate and  adapt in a variety of hosts. although no critical conjugative genes were detected, multiple insertion sequence elements were found scattered throughout pk245, and these may facilitate the dissemination of the antimicrobial resistance determinants. we conclude that pk245 is a chimera which acquired its multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants horizontally from different sources. the identification of pk245 plasmid expands the repertoire of the coexistence of quinolone and extended-spectrum-beta-lactam resistance determinants in plasmids carried by various species of the family enterobacteriaceae in different countries.

AB  == understanding the consequences of drug withdrawal on immune function and host defense to infection is important. we, and others, previously demonstrated that morphine withdrawal results in immunosuppression and sensitizes to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. in the present study, the effect of morphine withdrawal on spontaneous sepsis and on oral infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was examined. mice were chronically exposed to morphine for 96 h by implantation of a slow-release morphine pellet. abrupt withdrawal was induced by removal of the pellet. in the sepsis model, bacterial colonization was examined and bacterial species were identified by necropsy of various tissues. it was found that at 48 h postwithdrawal, morphine-treated mice  had enteric bacteria that were detected in the peyer's patches (4/5), mesenteric  lymph nodes (4/5), spleens (4/10), livers (6/10), and peritoneal cavities (8/10). in placebo pellet-withdrawn mice, only 2/40 cultures were positive. the most frequently detected organisms in tissues of morphine-withdrawn mice were enterococcus faecium followed by klebsiella pneumoniae. both organisms are part of the normal gastrointestinal flora. in the infection model, mice were orally inoculated with s. enterica 24 h post-initiation of abrupt withdrawal from morphine. withdrawal significantly decreased the mean survival time and significantly increased the salmonella burden in various tissues of infected mice compared to placebo-withdrawn animals. elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were observed in spleens of morphine-withdrawn mice, compared to placebo-withdrawn mice. these findings demonstrate that morphine withdrawal sensitizes to oral infection with a bacterial pathogen and predisposes mice to bacterial sepsis.

TI  == two transsulfurylation pathways in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == in most bacteria, inorganic sulfur is assimilated into cysteine, which provides sulfur for methionine biosynthesis via transsulfurylation. here, cysteine is transferred to the terminal carbon of homoserine via its sulfhydryl group to form cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. in the enteric bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, these reactions are catalyzed by irreversible cystathionine-gamma-synthase and cystathionine-beta-lyase enzymes. alternatively, yeast and some bacteria assimilate sulfur into homocysteine, which serves as a sulfhydryl group donor in the synthesis of cysteine by reverse transsulfurylation with a cystathionine-beta-synthase and cystathionine-gamma-lyase. herein we report that the related enteric bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae encodes genes for both transsulfurylation pathways; genetic and biochemical analyses show that they are coordinately regulated to prevent futile cycling. klebsiella uses reverse transsulfurylation to recycle methionine  to cysteine during periods of sulfate starvation. this methionine-to-cysteine (mtc) transsulfurylation pathway is activated by cysteine starvation via the cysb protein, by adenosyl-phosphosulfate starvation via the cbl protein, and by methionine excess via the metj protein. while mtc mutants cannot use methionine as a sulfur source on solid medium, they will utilize methionine in liquid medium via a sulfide intermediate, suggesting that an additional nontranssulfurylation methionine-to-cysteine recycling pathway(s) operates under these conditions.

TI  == dissemination and persistence of blactx-m-9 are linked to class 1 integrons containing cr1 associated with defective transposon derivatives from tn402 located in early antibiotic resistance plasmids of inchi2, incp1-alpha, and incfi groups.
AB  == this study analyzes the diversity of in60, a class 1 integron bearing cr1 and containing bla(ctx-m-9), and its association with tn402, tn21, and classical conjugative plasmids among 45 ctx-m-9-producing clinical strains (41 escherichia  coli strains, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 1 salmonella enterica strain, and  1 enterobacter cloacae strain). forty-five patients in a spanish tertiary care hospital were studied (1996 to 2003). the diversity of in60 and association of in60 with tn402 or mercury resistance transposons were investigated by overlapping pcr assays and/or hybridization. plasmid characterization included comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and determination of incompatibility group by pcr-based replicon typing, sequencing, and hybridization. ctx-m-9 plasmids belonged to inchi2 (n = 26), incp-1alpha (n = 10), incfi (n = 4), and inci (n = 1) groups. genetic platforms containing bla(ctx-m-9) were classified in six types in relation to the in60 backbone and in eight subtypes in relation to tn402 derivatives. they were associated with tn21 sequences when located in incp-1alpha or inchi2 plasmids. our study identified bla(ctx-m-9) in a high diversity of cr1-bearing class 1 integrons linked to different tn402 derivatives, often to tn21, highlighting the role of recombination events in the evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids. the presence of bla(ctx-m-9) on broad-host-range incp-1alpha plasmids might contribute to its dissemination to hosts that were not members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [transference of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases from nosocomial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae to other species of enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == background: klebsiella pneumoniae is an important pathogenic bacterium, frequently isolated from nosocomial samples, that exhibits wide antimicrobial resistance profiles, including third generation cephalosporins (3gc), aminoglycosides and quinolones. the resistance to 3gc is mainly due to the synthesis of extended spectrum beta lactamases (esbl), encoded by conjugative plasmids. aim: to investigate the potential transference of resistance to 3gc from nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae to other clinical strains of various species of enterobacteriaceae. material and methods: the mating experiments were  carried out in liquid media and three nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae were used as donors. these strains were esbl-producers and resistant to, at least, one of the 3gc assayed. one strain of citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli, isolated from clinical specimens, were  used as recipients. the presence of bla genes was investigated by pcr. results: the three nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae were able to transfer the resistance to 3gc and the genes encoding the esbl to the susceptible recipient strains of enterobacteria. the frequency of transference was as high as 3.2 x 10-2 transconjugants/recipient cell when the strain of citrobacter freundii was used as recipient. all transconjugants exhibited high level of resistance to the  3gc assayed. conclusions: strains of k. pneumoniae isolated from chilean hospitals are able to disseminate the esbl genes to clinical strains of others species of enterobacteriaaceae.

TI  == bacterial endotoxin as inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of human thrombin.
AB  == endotoxemia caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) deleteriously affects many aspects of hemostasis. much of this effect is well characterized as being secondary to the lps-mediated inflammatory response, but direct effects of lps on coagulation factors may also contribute to disregulation of the hemostatic process. spectrophotometric assays were used to investigate the effects of lps from different bacteria on thrombin and plasmin activities. we found that enzymatic activity of purified thrombin, but not plasmin, decreases in the presence of endotoxin. lps-mediated inhibition of thrombin activity can be reversed by plasma gelsolin and recombinant endotoxin-neutralizing protein. preincubation of thrombin with lps before platelet activation results in inhibition of aggregation and secretion. additionally, a decrease of elastic shear moduli of fibrin gels was observed when their formation was induced with thrombin preincubated with lps or when lps was present in fibrinogen solutions during fibrin gel formation. when added to platelet-rich plasma, after activation with collagen, lps-inhibited thrombin activity. lps-mediated inhibition of thrombin activity may contribute to the hemostasis dysfunctions observed during endotoxemia.

AB  == eleven klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates and one klebsiella oxytoca clinical isolate showing various pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types and producing an inducible dha-1 class c beta-lactamase were isolated in the parisian region between 1998 and 2003. the aim of this study was to compare the genetic organization of the bla(dha-1) genes in this collection of clinical isolates. in  four isolates, the morganella morganii-derived genomic region containing bla(dha-1) was inserted in an entire complex sul1-type integron, including a region common to in6-in7 (cr1), as previously described in a bla(dha-1)-producing salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis kf92 isolate from saudi arabia in 1992. different gene cassette arrays were characterized in each of these integrons. in  two of them, an additional 10-kb fragment was inserted between the cr1 and the m. morganii-derived region and was similar to the sap (abc transporter family) and psp (phage shock protein) operons originated from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the length of the m. morganii region was variable, suggesting that several independent recombination events have occurred and that open reading frame orf513 encodes a recombinase involved in the mobilization of the resistance genes. the genetic organization of bla(dha-1) was identical in the eight other isolates. this structure is likely derived from a complex integron following the  insertion of is26, leading to the deletion of the first part of integron. the horizontal transfer of one plasmid carrying that truncated integron was shown for seven of these isolates.

TI  == the distinct binding specificities exhibited by enterobacterial type 1 fimbriae are determined by their fimbrial shafts.
AB  == type 1 fimbriae of enterobacteria are heteropolymeric organelles of adhesion composed of fimh, a mannose-binding lectin, and a shaft composed primarily of fima. we compared the binding activities of recombinant clones expressing type 1  fimbriae from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium for gut and uroepithelial cells and for various soluble mannosylated proteins. each fimbria was characterized by its capacity to bind particular epithelial cells and to aggregate mannoproteins. however, when each respective fimh subunit  was cloned and expressed in the absence of its shaft as a fusion protein with male, each fimh bound a wide range of mannose-containing compounds. in addition,  we found that expression of fimh on a heterologous fimbrial shaft, e.g. k. pneumoniae fimh on the e. coli fimbrial shaft or vice versa, altered the binding  specificity of fimh such that it closely resembled that of the native heterologous type 1 fimbriae. furthermore, attachment to and invasion of bladder  epithelial cells, which were mediated much better by native e. coli type 1 fimbriae compared with native k. pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae, were found to be dependent on the background of the fimbrial shaft (e. coli versus k. pneumoniae)  rather than the background of the fimh expressed. thus, the distinct binding specificities of different enterobacterial type 1 fimbriae cannot be ascribed solely to the primary structure of their respective fimh subunits, but are also modulated by the fimbrial shaft on which each fimh subunit is presented, possibly through conformational constraints imposed on fimh by the fimbrial shaft. the capacity of type 1 fimbrial shafts to modulate the tissue tropism of different enterobacterial species represents a novel function for these highly organized structures.

TI  == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however,  on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased  susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible  h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation  of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

AB  == the effect of high-energy electron beam irradiation on the survival of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and psychrotrophic bacteria on commercial chicken breast meat was evaluated. fresh chicken breast meat was purchased from a local poultry processor, inoculated with 8 log10 cfu/ml salmonella, packaged in styrofoam trays and over wrapped with a polyvinyl chloride film, and subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 kgy of irradiation. the packaged samples were stored at 4 degrees c and analyzed for salmonella typhimurium and psychrotrophic organisms at 0, 2, 4,  6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d of storage. direct plating and enrichment methods were used for s. typhimurium analyses. the direct plating method revealed a 4 log reduction in salmonella for chicken breasts inoculated and treated with 1, 2, or  3 kgy of irradiation. psychrotrophic counts were conducted at 7 degrees c for 10  d and 25 degrees c for 5 d to determine the effect of incubation methods on the recovery of psychrotrophic organisms. the enrichment method resulted in the repair of injured salmonella cells and an elevated salmonella typhimurium count for all irradiation dosages when compared with data reported for the direct plating method. in general, psychrotrophic counts increased as storage time increased. however, psychrotrophic counts decreased (p < 0.05) as the irradiation dosage increased.

TI  == characterization of gla(kp), a udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase from klebsiella pneumoniae with extended substrate specificity.
AB  == in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, the core oligosaccharide backbone of the lipopolysaccharide is modified by phosphoryl groups. the negative charges provided by these residues are important in maintaining the barrier function of the outer membrane. in contrast, klebsiella pneumoniae lacks phosphoryl groups in its core oligosaccharide but instead contains galacturonic acid residues that are proposed to serve a similar function in outer membrane stability. gla(kp) is a udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase that provides udp-galacturonic acid for core synthesis, and the enzyme was biochemically characterized because of its potentially important role in outer membrane stability. high-performance anion-exchange chromatography was used to demonstrate the udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase activity of gla(kp), and capillary electrophoresis was used for activity assays. the reaction equilibrium favors udp-galacturonic acid over udp-glucuronic acid in a ratio of 1.4:1, with the k(m) for udp-glucuronic acid of 13.0 microm. gla(kp) exists as a dimer in its native form. nad+/nadh is tightly bound by the enzyme and addition of supplementary nad+ is not required for activity of the purified enzyme. divalent cations have an unexpected inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. gla(kp) was found to have a broad substrate specificity in vitro; it is capable of interconverting udp-glucose/udp-galactose  and udp-n-acetylglucosamine/udp-n-acetylgalactosamine, albeit at much lower activity. the epimerase gale interconverts udp-glucose/udp-galactose. multicopy plasmid-encoded gla(kp) partially complemented a gale mutation in s. enterica and in k. pneumoniae; however, chromosomal gla(kp) could not substitute for gale in a k. pneumoniae gale mutant in vivo.

TI  == defective o-antigen polymerization in tola and pal mutants of escherichia coli in response to extracytoplasmic stress.
AB  == we have previously shown that the tola protein is required for the correct surface expression of the escherichia coli o7 antigen lipopolysaccharide (lps). in this work, delta tola and delta pal mutants of e. coli k-12 w3110 were transformed with pmf19 (encoding a rhamnosyltransferase that reconstitutes the expression of o16-specific lps), pwq5 (encoding the klebsiella pneumoniae o1 lps  gene cluster), or pwq802 (encoding the genes necessary for the synthesis of salmonella enterica o:54). both deltatola and delta pal mutants exhibited reduced surface expression of o16 lps as compared to parental w3110, but no significant differences were observed in the expression of k. pneumoniae o1 lps and s. enterica o:54 lps. therefore, tola and pal are required for the correct surface expression of o antigens that are assembled in a wzy (polymerase)-dependent manner (like those of e. coli o7 and o16) but not for o antigens assembled by wzy-independent pathways (like k. pneumoniae o1 and s. enterica o:54). furthermore, we show that the reduced surface expression of o16 lps in delta tola and delta pal mutants was associated with a partial defect in o-antigen polymerization and it was corrected by complementation with intact tola and pal genes, respectively. using derivatives of w3110 delta tola and w3110 delta pal containing lacz reporter fusions to fkpa and degp, we also demonstrate that the rpoe-mediated extracytoplasmic stress response is upregulated in these mutants. moreover, an altered o16 polymerization was also detected under conditions that stimulate rpoe-mediated extracytoplasmic stress responses in tol+ and pal+ genetic backgrounds. a wzy derivative with an epitope tag at the c-terminal end of the protein was stable in all the mutants, ruling out stress-mediated proteolysis of wzy. we conclude that the absence of tola and pal elicits a sustained extracytoplasmic stress response that in turn reduces o-antigen polymerization but does not affect the stability of the wzy o-antigen polymerase.

TI  == physical linkage of tn3 and part of tn1721 in a tetracycline and ampicillin resistance plasmid from salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == objectives: the complete nucleotide sequence of the 12 656 bp plasmid pfptb1 from salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, which mediates resistance to tetracyclines and ampicillin, was determined. the plasmid was analysed for potential reading frames and structural features indicative of transposons and transposon relics. methods: plasmid pfptb1 was transformed into escherichia coli jm109, overlapping restriction fragments were cloned into e. coli plasmid vectors and sequenced. in vitro susceptibility testing was carried out to confirm the resistance phenotype mediated by this plasmid. results: plasmid pfptb1 contains a complete tn3-like transposon of 4950 bp consisting of the left terminal repeat, tn3-related tnpr and tnpa genes for transposition functions, a novel gene for ampicillin resistance bla(tem-135), and the right terminal repeat. immediately downstream, the terminal 5215 bp at the right end of a tn1721-like transposon, including the right terminal repeat, a truncated transposase gene, as well as the genes tet(a) and tetr for tetracycline resistance, were detected. a 5 bp direct repeat, taaaa, was seen immediately upstream of the tn3 part and immediately downstream of the tn1721 part. plasmid pfptb1 also carries a replication region similar to that of the klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pjhcmw1. conclusion: plasmid pfptb1 is one of the few completely sequenced plasmids from s. typhimurium and harbours a novel transposon-like structure consisting of a tn3-related part containing the bla(tem-135) gene for ampicillin resistance and a tn1721-related part containing  the tetr-tet(a) genes for tetracycline resistance.

TI  == regulation of enteric endophytic bacterial colonization by plant defenses.
AB  == bacterial endophytes reside within the interior of plants without causing disease or forming symbiotic structures. some endophytes, such as klebsiella pneumoniae 342 (kp342), enhance plant growth and nutrition. others, such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), are human pathogens that contaminate raw produce. several lines of evidence are presented here to support  the hypothesis that plant defense response pathways regulate colonization by endophytic bacteria. an ethylene-insensitive mutant of medicago truncatula is hypercolonized by kp342 compared to the parent genotype. addition of ethylene, a  signal molecule for induced systemic resistance in plants, decreased endophytic colonization in medicago spp. this ethylene-mediated inhibition of endophytic colonization was reversed by addition of the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene. colonization of medicago spp. by s. typhimurium also was affected by exogenous ethylene. mutants lacking flagella or a component of the type iii secretion system of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (ttss-spi1) colonize the interior of medicago spp. in higher numbers than the wild type. arabidopsis defense response-related genotypes indicated that only salicylic acid (sa)-independent defense responses contribute to restricting colonization by kp342. in contrast, colonization by s. typhimurium is affected by both sa-dependent and -independent responses. s. typhimurium mutants further delineated these responses, suggesting that both flagella and ttss-spi1 effectors can be recognized. flagella act primarily through sa-independent responses (compromising sa accumulation still affected colonization in the absence of flagella). removal of a ttss-spi1 effector resulted in hypercolonization regardless of whether the genotype was affected in either sa-dependent or sa-independent responses. consistent with these results, s. typhimurium activates the promoter of pr1, a sa-dependent pathogenesis-related gene, while s. typhimurium mutants lacking the ttss-spi1 failed to activate this promoter. these observations suggest approaches to reduce contamination of raw produce by human enteric pathogens and to increase the number of growth-promoting bacteria in plants.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the acid-inducible asr gene in enterobacteria.
AB  == we show here that transcription of the asr gene in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae is strongly dependent on the acidification level of the growth medium, with maximal  induction at ph 4.0-4.5 as determined by northern hybridization analysis. previous gene array analyses have also shown that asr is the most acid-induced gene in the e. coli genome. sequence alignment of the asr promoters from different enterobacterial species identified a highly conserved region located at position -70 to -30 relative to the asr transcriptional start site. by deletion of various segments of this region in the e. coli asr promoter it was shown that  sequences upstream from the -40 position were important for induction. transcription from the e. coli asr promoter was demonstrated to be growth-phase-dependent and to require the alternative sigma factor rpos (sigma(s)) in stationary phase. transcription of the asr gene was also found to be subject to negative control by the nucleoid protein h-ns.

TI  == identics--identification of coding sequence and in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network directly from unannotated low-coverage bacterial genome sequence.
AB  == background: a necessary step for a genome level analysis of the cellular metabolism is the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network from genome sequences. the available methods are mainly based on the annotation of genome sequences including two successive steps, the prediction of coding sequences (cds) and their function assignment. the annotation process takes time. the available methods often encounter difficulties when dealing with unfinished error-containing genomic sequence. results: in this work a fast method is proposed to use unannotated genome sequence for predicting cdss and for an in silico reconstruction of metabolic networks. instead of using predicted genes or  cdss to query public databases, entries from public dna or protein databases are  used as queries to search a local database of the unannotated genome sequence to  predict cdss. functions are assigned to the predicted cdss simultaneously. the well-annotated genome of salmonella typhimurium lt2 is used as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the method. 97.7% of the cdss in the original annotation are correctly identified. the use of swiss-prot-trembl databases resulted in an identification of 98.9% of cdss that have ec-numbers in the published annotation. furthermore, two versions of sequences of the bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae with different genome coverage (3.9 and 7.9 fold, respectively) are examined. the results suggest that a 3.9-fold coverage of the bacterial genome could be sufficiently used for the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network. compared to other gene finding methods such as critica our method is more suitable for exploiting sequences of low genome coverage. based on the new method, a program called identics (identification of coding sequences from unfinished genome sequences) is delivered that combines the identification of cdss with the reconstruction, comparison and visualization of metabolic networks (free to download at http://genome.gbf.de/bioinformatics/index.html). conclusions: the reversed querying process and the program identics allow a fast  and adequate prediction protein coding sequences and reconstruction of the potential metabolic network from low coverage genome sequences of bacteria. the new method can accelerate the use of genomic data for studying cellular metabolism.

TI  == effect of triclosan or a phenolic farm disinfectant on the selection of antibiotic-resistant salmonella enterica.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of growth of five strains of salmonella enterica and their isogenic multiply antibiotic-resistant (mar) derivatives with  a phenolic farm disinfectant or triclosan (biocides) upon the frequency of mutation to resistance to antibiotics or cyclohexane. methods: strains were grown in broth with or without the biocides and then spread on to agar containing ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or tetracycline each at 4x mic or agar overlaid with cyclohexane. incubation was for 24 and 48 h and the frequency of mutation to resistance was calculated for strains with and without prior growth with the biocides. mics were determined and the presence of mutations in the acrr and marr regions was determined by sequencing and the presence of mutations in gyra by light-cycler analysis, for a selection of the mutants that arose. results: the mean frequency of mutation to antibiotic or cyclohexane resistance was increased  approximately 10- to 100-fold by prior growth with the phenolic disinfectant or triclosan. the increases were statistically significant for all antibiotics and cyclohexane following exposure to the phenolic disinfectant (p </= 0.013), and for ampicillin and cyclohexane following exposure to triclosan (p </= 0.009). mutants inhibited by >1 mg/l ciprofloxacin arose only from strains that were mar. reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (at 4x mic for parent strains) alone was  associated with mutations in gyra. mar mutants did not contain mutations in the acrr or marr region. conclusions: these data renew fears that the use of biocides may lead to an increased selective pressure towards antibiotic resistance.

TI  == the genes and enzymes for the catabolism of galactitol, d-tagatose, and related carbohydrates in klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 and other enteric bacteria display convergent evolution.
AB  == enteric bacteria (enteriobacteriaceae) carry on their single chromosome about 4000 genes that all strains have in common (referred to here as "obligatory genes"), and up to 1300 "facultative" genes that vary from strain to strain and from species to species. in closely related species, obligatory and facultative genes are orthologous genes that are found at similar loci. we have analyzed a set of facultative genes involved in the degradation of the carbohydrates galactitol, d-tagatose, d-galactosamine and n-acetyl-galactosamine in various pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of these bacteria. the four carbohydrates are transported into the cell by phosphotransferase (pts) uptake systems, and are metabolized by closely related or even identical catabolic enzymes via pathways that share several intermediates. in about 60% of escherichia coli strains the genes for galactitol degradation map to a gat operon at 46.8 min. in strains of salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, the corresponding gat  genes, although orthologous to their e. coli counterparts, are found at 70.7 min, clustered in a regulon together with three tag genes for the degradation of d-tagatose, an isomer of d-fructose. in contrast, in all the e. coli strains tested, this chromosomal site was found to be occupied by an aga/kba gene cluster for the degradation of d-galactosamine and n-acetyl-galactosamine. the aga/kba and the tag genes were paralogous either to the gat cluster or to the fru genes for degradation of d-fructose. finally, in more then 90% of strains of both klebsiella species, and in about 5% of the e. coli strains, two operons were found at 46.8 min that comprise paralogous genes for catabolism of the isomers d-arabinitol (genes atl or dal) and ribitol (genes rtl or rbt). in these strains  gat genes were invariably absent from this location, and they were totally absent in s. enterica. these results strongly indicate that these various gene clusters  and metabolic pathways have been subject to convergent evolution among the enterobacteriaceae. this apparently involved recent horizontal gene transfer and  recombination events, as indicated by major chromosomal rearrangements found in their immediate vicinity.

AB  == the salmonella enterica serovar typhi omps2 gene codes for a 362-amino-acid outer membrane protein that contains motifs common to the porin superfamily. it is expressed at very low levels compared to the major ompc and ompf porins, as observed for s. enterica serovar typhi omps1, escherichia coli ompn, and klebsiella pneumoniae ompk37 quiescent porins. a region of 316 bp, between nucleotides -413 and -97 upstream of the transcriptional start point, is involved in negative regulation, as its removal resulted in a 10-fold increase in omps2 expression in an s. enterica serovar typhi wild-type strain. this enhancement in  expression was not observed in isogenic mutant strains, which had specific deletions of the regulatory ompb (ompr envz) operon. furthermore, omps2 expression was substantially reduced in the presence of the ompr d55a mutant, altered in the major phosphorylation site. upon random mutagenesis, a mutant where the transposon had inserted into the upstream regulatory region of the gene coding for the leuo regulator, showed an increased level of omps2 expression. augmented expression of omps2 was also obtained upon addition of cloned leuo to the wild-type strain, but not in an ompr isogenic derivative, consistent with the notion that the transposon insertion had increased the cellular levels of leuo and with the observed dependence on ompr. moreover, leuo and ompr bound in close  proximity, but independently, to the 5' upstream regulatory region. thus, the ompr and leuo regulators positively regulate omps2.

AB  == the transcriptional enhancer protein rfah positively regulates production of virulence factors in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium via a cis element, ops. genes coding for rfah orthologs were identified in conceptually translated genomes of bacterial pathogens, including vibrio and yersinia spp. we cloned the rfah genes from vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae into e. coli expression vectors. purified rfah orthologs, including the most divergent one from v. cholerae, were readily recruited to the e. coli transcription elongation complex. postrecruitment stimulation of transcript elongation appeared to vary with the degree of similarity to e. coli rfah. v. cholerae rfah was particularly defective in reducing downstream pausing and termination; this defect was substantially alleviated by an increase in its concentration. when overexpressed episomally, all of the rfah genes complemented the disruption of the chromosomal copy of the e. coli gene. thus, despite the apparently accelerated divergent evolution of the rfah proteins, the mechanism of their action is conserved well enough to make them transcriptionally active in the e. coli system.

AB  == the gene cluster (waa) involved in serratia marcescens n28b core lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis was identified, cloned, and sequenced. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from escherichia coli k-12, salmonella enterica, and klebsiella pneumoniae led to the identification of five  genes coding for products involved in the biosynthesis of a shared inner core structure: [l,d-heppiiialpha(1-->7)-l,d-heppiialpha(1-->3)-l,d-heppialpha(1-->5)-kdopi(4<--2 )alphakdopii] (l,d-hepp, l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose; kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid). complementation and/or chemical analysis of several nonpolar mutants within the s. marcescens waa gene cluster suggested that in addition, three waa genes were shared by s. marcescens and k. pneumoniae, indicating that the core region of the lps of s. marcescens and k. pneumoniae possesses additional common features. chemical and structural analysis of the major oligosaccharide from the core region of lps of an o-antigen-deficient mutant of s. marcescens n28b as well as complementation analysis led to the following proposed structure: beta-glc-(1-->6)-alpha-glc-(1-->4))-alpha-d-glcn-(1-->4)-alpha-d-gala-[(2<--1)-al pha-d,d-hep-(2<--1)-alpha-hep]-(1-->3)-alpha-l,d-hep[(7<--1)-alpha-l,d-hep]-(1--> 3)-alpha-l,d-hep-[(4<--1)-beta-d-glc]-(1-->5)-kdo. the d configuration of the beta-glc, alpha-gcln, and alpha-gala residues was deduced from genetic data and thus is tentative. furthermore, other oligosaccharides were identified by ion cyclotron resonance-fourier-transformed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which presumably contained in addition one residue of d-glycero-d-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (ko) or of a hexuronic acid. several ions were identified that differed from others by a mass of +80 da, suggesting a nonstoichiometric substitution by a monophosphate residue. however, none of these molecular species could be isolated in substantial amounts and structurally analyzed. on the basis of the structure shown above and the analysis of nonpolar  mutants, functions are suggested for the genes involved in core biosynthesis.

TI  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium rama, intracellular oxidative stress response, and bacterial virulence.
AB  == escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium have evolved genetic systems, such as the soxr/s and mara regulons, to detoxify reactive oxygen species, like superoxide, which are formed as by-products of metabolism. superoxide also serves as a microbicidal effector mechanism of the host's phagocytes. here, we investigate whether regulatory genes other than soxr/s and mara are active in response to oxidative stress in salmonella and may function as virulence determinants. we identified a bacterial gene, which was designated rama (342 bp) and mapped at 13.1 min on the salmonella chromosome, that, when overexpressed on a plasmid in e. coli or salmonella, confers a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by increased resistance to the redox-cycling agent menadione and to multiple unrelated antibiotics. the rama gene is present in salmonella serovars but is absent in e. coli. the gene product displays 37 to 52% homology to the transcriptional activators soxr/s and mara and 80 to 100% identity to a multidrug resistance gene in klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi a. although a rama soxr/s double null mutant is highly susceptible to intracellular superoxide generated by menadione and displays decreased mn-superoxide dismutase activity, intracellular survival of this mutant within macrophage-like raw 264.7 cells and in vivo replication in the spleens in  ityr mice are not affected. we concluded that despite its role in the protective  response of the bacteria to oxidative stress in vitro, the newly identified rama  gene, together with soxr/s, does not play a role in initial replication of salmonella in the organs of mice.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

AB  == background: recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. results: it is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. furthermore, the gc3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. conclusions: the results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. the importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

TI  == florfenicol resistance in salmonella enterica serovar newport mediated by a plasmid related to r55 from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == florfenicol resistance has emerged over the past few years in multidrug-resistant salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium, agona and paratyphi b. the flor gene encoding florfenicol resistance is chromosomally located in these serovars within a genomic island of 43 kb called sgi1 (salmonella genomic island 1). in the present study, we characterized florfenicol resistance in a strain of s. enterica serovar newport isolated from a turkey in 1990 and that lacked sgi1. florfenicol  resistance was mediated by a conjugative plasmid related to r55 from klebsiella pneumoniae, which was characterized initially in the 1970s and harbours a gene 95% identical to flor.

AB  == a salmonella enterica serotype cubana isolate exhibiting resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including oxyimino-cephalosporins and imipenem, was isolated from a 4-year-old boy with gastroenteritis in maryland. beta-lactam resistance was mediated by a conjugative plasmid that encoded kpc-2, a class a carbapenemase previously found in a klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the maryland area as well. sequence analysis of the flanking regions indicated a potential association of bla(kpc-2) with mobile structures.

TI  == emergence of ceftriaxone-resistant salmonella isolates and rapid spread of plasmid-encoded cmy-2-like cephalosporinase, taiwan.
AB  == of 384 salmonella isolates collected from 1997 to 2000 in a university hospital in taiwan, six ceftriaxone-resistant isolates of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were found in two patients in 2000. the resistance determinants were  on conjugative plasmids that encoded a cmy-2-like cephalosporinase. during the study period, the proportion of cmy-2-like enzyme producers among escherichia coli increased rapidly from 0.2% in early 1999 to >4.0% in late 2000. klebsiella  pneumoniae isolates producing a cmy-2-like beta-lactamase did not emerge until 2000. the presence of bla(cmy)-containing plasmids with an identical restriction  pattern from salmonella, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae isolates was found, which suggests interspecies spread and horizontal transfer of the resistance determinant. various nosocomial and community-acquired infections were associated with the cmy-2-like enzyme producers. our study suggests that the spread of plasmid-mediated cmy-2-like beta-lactamases is an emerging threat to hospitalized patients and the public in taiwan.

TI  == kinetics and strain specificity of rhizosphere and endophytic colonization by enteric bacteria on seedlings of medicago sativa and medicago truncatula.
AB  == the presence of human-pathogenic, enteric bacteria on the surface and in the interior of raw produce is a significant health concern. several aspects of the biology of the interaction between these bacteria and alfalfa (medicago sativa) seedlings are addressed here. a collection of enteric bacteria associated with alfalfa sprout contaminations, along with escherichia coli k-12, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium strain atcc 14028, and an endophyte of maize, klebsiella pneumoniae 342, were labeled with green fluorescent protein, and their abilities to colonize the rhizosphere and the interior of the plant were compared. these strains differed widely in their endophytic colonization abilities, with k. pneumoniae 342 and e. coli k-12 being the best and worst colonizers, respectively. the abilities of the pathogens were between those of k. pneumoniae 342 and e. coli k-12. all salmonella bacteria colonized the interiors  of the seedlings in high numbers with an inoculum of 10(2) cfu, although infection characteristics were different for each strain. for most strains, a strong correlation between endophytic colonization and rhizosphere colonization was observed. these results show significant strain specificity for plant entry by these strains. significant colonization of lateral root cracks was observed, suggesting that this may be the site of entry into the plant for these bacteria.  at low inoculum levels, a symbiosis mutant of medicago truncatula, dmi1, was colonized in higher numbers on the rhizosphere and in the interior by a salmonella endophyte than was the wild-type host. endophytic entry of m. truncatula appears to occur by a mechanism independent of the symbiotic infections by sinorhizobium meliloti or mycorrhizal fungi.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from different bacterial sources elicit disparate cytokine responses in whole blood assays.
AB  == the stimulatory effects of different purified lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations from e. coli, s. typhosa, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae on cytokine and chemokine production were measured in whole blood assays by elisa. incubation of 0.5 ml whole blood with 10 ng/ml e. coli and s. typhosa resulted in a time-dependent production of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, ifn-gamma, il-10 and mcp-1. k. pneumoniae, however, showed preferential effects on il-1beta, il-10 and mcp-1  production with less potent effects on tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma. lps derived from  p. aeruginosa showed a similar potency to other lps preparations on mcp-1 production, yet completely failed to elicit the production of other cytokines. to further investigate potencies of the different lps preparations, mediator production was determined following stimulation with agonist concentrations of 0.1 ng and 1000 ng per ml over a 24 h time period. dose-response curves were obtained with lps derived from e. coli, s. typhosa and k. pneumoniae on all mediators apart from il-1beta and mcp-1. most strikingly though, was the ability  of lps derived from p. aeruginosa to selectively elicit a significant dose-response effect on mcp-1 production, despite its very weak stimulatory effects on all other cytokines. these data imply that the bacterial origin of different lps preparations can exhibit disparate effects on inflammatory mediator production. furthermore, the potent, selective dose-response effect of p. aeruginosa lps on mcp-1 production could help to explain the preponderance of a relentless inflammatory cellular infiltrate in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (cf).

TI  == the avian chorioallantoic membrane in ovo--a useful model for bacterial invasion  assays.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the practicability of the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (cam) with special regard to the 'natural air sac' technique (nast) of preparation for in-vivo research on the invasive potential of bacterial strains of various enterobacterial species. it was sought to establish  an experimental system more closely resembling in-vivo conditions than cell lines on one hand, and cheaper and easier to handle than established animal models on the other. fertilized eggs of the domestic fowl were incubated. the cam was prepared atraumatically at the natural air space of the egg, and a cannula was inserted for subsequent extraction of allantoic fluid (af) below the cam. the cam was then inoculated with either one out of five strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, an escherichia coli k-12 strain or a salmonella typhimurium strain, either alone  or in combinations, respectively. af samples were extracted at certain time points, and the presence of bacteria was determined by cultivation. penetration and mortality ratios of the infected embryos were calculated. in addition, the mode of crossing the epithelial barrier was examined by electron microscopy. differing rates of invasion through the cam and rates of mortality of the chicken embryos demonstrated a clear dependency on the inoculated bacterial strain. low invading bacteria could be distinguished from intermediate strains, and from strains exerting a strong capability of invasion and killing of the embryos. simultaneous monotopical inoculation of klebsiella and e. coli showed a permissive effect of co-incubated klebsiella on the invasiveness of e. coli. the  chick embryo cam prepared by nast has shown to be a useful model for in vivo studies on invasion capabilities, pathogenicity and interactions of inoculated bacteria.

TI  == emergence of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing inducible dha-1 beta-lactamase in a university hospital in taiwan.
AB  == ten nonrepetitive clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae exhibiting an unusual inducible beta-lactam resistance phenotype were identified between january 1999 and september 2001 in a university hospital in taiwan. in the presence of 2 micro g of clavulanic acid, the isolates showed a one to four twofold concentration increase in the mics of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cefepime (mics, </=0.5 micro g/ml) and imipenem (mics, </=0.5 micro g/ml). pcr, sequence analysis, and isoelectric focusing revealed production by these isolates of tem-1, shv-11, and dha-1, a plasmid-encoded inducible ampc beta-lactamase originally found in a salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis strain. transfer of the resistance by conjugation experiments was not successful, but southern hybridization showed that bla(dha-1) was located on 70-kb plasmids, suggesting that the bla(dha-1)-containing plasmids in the k. pneumoniae isolates were non-self-transmissible. five isolates were recovered from patients in two surgery wards and two intensive care units. acquisition of the dha-1 producers could be traced back to previous hospitalizations 1 to 5 months earlier for the other five patients. six and seven patterns among the isolates were demonstrated by plasmid analysis and ribotyping, respectively, indicating that the spread of the dha-1 producers was due to both horizontal transfer of bla(dha-1) and dissemination of endemic clones.

TI  == fe(iii)-mediated cellular toxicity.
AB  == because it can undergo reversible changes in oxidation state, iron is an excellent biocatalyst but also a potentially deleterious metal. iron-mediated toxicity has been ascribed to fe(ii), which reacts with oxygen to generate free radicals that damage macromolecules and cause cell death. however, we now report  that fe(iii) exhibits microbicidal activity towards strains of salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae defective in the fe(iii)-responding pmra/pmrb signal transduction system. fe(iii) bound to a pmra  salmonella mutant more effectively than to the isogenic wild-type strain and exerted its microbicidal activity even under anaerobic conditions. moreover, fe(iii) permeabilized the outer membrane of the pmra mutant, rendering it susceptible to vancomycin, which is normally non-toxic to gram-negative species.  on the other hand, fe(iii) did not affect the viability of a mutant defective in  fur, the major regulator of cytosolic iron homeostasis, which is hypersensitive to fe(ii)-mediated toxicity. a functional pmra gene was necessary for bacterial survival in soil. our results indicate that fe(iii) exerts its microbicidal activity by a mechanism that is oxygen independent and different from that mediated by fe(ii).

TI  == detection of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase genes in clinical isolates by using multiplex pcr.
AB  == therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. these organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. six families of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. this report describes the development of a multiplex pcr for the purpose of identifying family-specific ampc beta-lactamase  genes within gram-negative pathogens. the pcr uses six sets of ampc-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampc multiplex pcr differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampc-specific families in organisms such as klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium. family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampc genes. furthermore, this pcr-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. in addition, wave technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis  time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. in conclusion, a multiplex pcr technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampc genes  responsible for ampc beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase gene.

TI  == two class ii d-tagatose-bisphosphate aldolases from enteric bacteria.
AB  == escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniaeand klebsiella oxytocawere found to contain two d-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate (tagbp)-specific aldolases involved in catabolism of galactitol (genes gaty gatz) and of n-acetyl-galactosamine and d-galactosamine (genes kbay kbaz,also called agay agaz). the two aldolases were closely related (> or = 53.8% identical amino acids) and could substitute for each other in vivo. the catalytic subunits gaty or kbay alone were sufficient to show aldolase activity. although substantially shorter than other aldolases (285 amino acids, instead of 358 and 349 amino acids), these subunits contained most or all of the residues that have been identified as essential in substrate/product recognition and catalysis for class  ii aldolases. in contrast to these, both aldolases required subunits gatz or kbaz (420 amino acids) for full activity and for good in vivo and in vitro stability.  the z subunits alone did not show any aldolase activity. close relatives of these new tagbp aldolases were found in several gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, e.g., streptomyces coelicolor.

AB  == because a multiresistant k. pneumoniae outbreak detected in an intensive care unit of a parisian hospital, combined to the production of the plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase acc-1, a probable importation via a patient was suggested from another country (tunisia). the investigation was conducted to examine 35 clinical strains of enterobacteria resistant to ceftazidime without synergy towards augmentin. other test of synergy with two inhibitors, brl 42715, ro 48-5545 was performed by diffusion method and deposit of 10 micrograms of inhibitor on disks  containing ceftazidime, cefoxitin and cefotetan. synergies were obtained suggesting a probable production of acc-1 type among six isolates of k. pneumoniae (two), proteus mirabilis (one) and salmonella (three) issued from different units. the isoelectric focusing on gel revealed at least one band of beta-lactamase activity at 7.8 but also demonstrated the simultaneous production  of several probable beta-lactamases including tem-type, shv-2 and acc-1 among s.  enterica ser. livingstone. the pcr of the gene blaacc-1 was positive. the sequencing (1160 pb) of two products showed high identity (99-100%) with the gene blaacc-1 deposited in 1999. finally the acc-1 type reported in tunisia was probably imported in france via a patient. because a simultaneous synthesis of esbl and acc-1 type, its presence may be invisible and need more investigation.

TI  == complete genome sequence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2.
AB  == salmonella enterica subspecies i, serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis, and is used as a mouse model of human typhoid fever. the incidence of non-typhoid salmonellosis is increasing worldwide, causing millions of infections and many deaths in the human population each year. here we sequenced the 4,857-kilobase (kb) chromosome and 94-kb virulence plasmid of s. typhimurium strain lt2. the distribution of close homologues of s. typhimurium lt2 genes in eight related enterobacteria was determined using previously completed genomes of three related bacteria, sample sequencing of both s. enterica serovar paratyphi a (s. paratyphi a) and klebsiella pneumoniae, and hybridization of three unsequenced genomes to a microarray of s. typhimurium lt2 genes. lateral transfer of genes is frequent, with 11% of the s. typhimurium lt2 genes missing from s. enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi), and 29% missing from escherichia coli k12. the 352 gene homologues of s. typhimurium lt2 confined to subspecies i of s. enterica-containing most mammalian and bird pathogens-are useful for studies of epidemiology, host specificity and pathogenesis. most of these homologues were previously unknown, and 50 may be exported to the periplasm or outer membrane, rendering them accessible as therapeutic or vaccine targets.

AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (acm) with a wide range of disease severity. design: cohort study. animals: 144 dairy cows with acm from 6 herds. procedure: cows were examined at time of identification of acm (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), cbc, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. appropriate samples were  obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an acm episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. results: bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). group-1  isolates (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with acm and 0 of 156 control cows. group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe acm, respectively. escherichia coli and k pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of  the same genotype. bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. conclusions and  clinical relevance: results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with acm. classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with acm.

TI  == lethal escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium endotoxemia is mediated through different pathways.
AB  == despite the differences in the molecular structure between lipopolysaccharides (lps) isolated from escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae or salmonella typhimurium, the potential differences in their biological effects in vivo have not been investigated. in the present study, tnf and lt double knock-out (tnf-/-lt-/-) mice were almost as susceptible as tnf+/+lt+/+ controls to s. typhimurium lps, but they were significantly more resistant to lethal endotoxemia induced by e. coli or k. pneumoniae lps. the effect was not due to endotoxin-associated proteins. in the knock-out mice, this difference in lethality was accompanied by decreased interleukin-1 (il-1) and interferon-gamma  (ifn-gamma) production after challenge with e. coli lps, whereas after s. typhimurium lps more il-1 and ifn-gamma were produced. in contrast, more il-10 was produced after challenge of mice with e. coli lps than with s. typhimurium lps. the hypothesis that a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the mortality after s. typhimurium lps was suggested by experiments in mice deficient in il-1beta-converting enzyme (ice-/- mice). ice-/-mice, lacking mature il-1beta and il-18, but also defective in ifn-gamma and tnf production, were completely protected against both e. coli and s. typhimurium lps. experiments in toll-like receptor (tlr)-4 defective mice suggested that the difference is not due to differential activation of tlr4. in conclusion, tnf and lt play a central role in the lethality due to e. coli lps, whereas the lethal effects of s. typhimurium lps are mediated through mechanisms  also involving other cytokines such as ifn-gamma, il-1 and il-18.

AB  == cmy-2 plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase (cmy-2) was detected in 21 isolates from two hospitals located in different geographical regions of spain between october 1999 and december 2000. the isolates comprised two salmonella enterica serovars (mikawasima and montevideo), 16 escherichia coli, one klebsiella pneumoniae, one klebsiella oxytoca and one proteus mirabilis. in addition to the  expected resistance to beta-lactams, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cefoxitin, all isolates showed a broad spectrum of associated resistance. all were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and all but two were also resistant to gentamicin. five isolates were studied in detail and all transferred cmy-2 and other resistance determinants by conjugation. genomic dna restriction pattern analysis of the e. coli isolates excluded the dissemination of a single clone. to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that cmy-2 has been detected in p. mirabilis, k. oxytoca and s. enterica serovars mikawasima and montevideo. it is also the first  time that cmy-2 has been described in spain.

AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == comparative approach to analysis of regulation in complete genomes: multidrug resistance systems in gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  == comparative approach is a powerful tool for analysis of gene regulation in bacterial genomes. here we apply it to analysis of regulation of the multidrug resistance transport (mdrt) systems in enterobacteria escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia pestis. comparison of nucleotide sequences upstream of mdrt genes was performed in order to predict new regulatory sites (operators) and identify candidate regulons. since the regulatory sites diverge slower than the non-coding regions in general, they are  visible as strongly conserved islands. this analysis resulted in description of a regulatory network for known and hypothetical mdrt systems and porins. new candidate members of the mara regulon were detected. putative binding sites for emrr and acrr were suggested. a new hypothetical marx regulon was described that  includes some multidrug transporters and porins.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

TI  == conserved regulatory elements of the promoter sequence of the gene rpoh of enteric bacteria.
AB  == the rpoh regulatory region of different members of the enteric bacteria family was sequenced or downloaded from genbank and compared. in addition, the transcriptional start sites of rpoh of yersinia frederiksenii and proteus mirabilis, two distant members of this family, were determined. sequences similar to the sigma(70) promoters p1, p4 and p5, to the sigma(e) promoter p3 and to boxes dnaa1, dnaa2, camp receptor protein (crp) boxes crp1, crp2 and box cytr present in escherichia coli k12, were identified in sequences of closely related  bacteria such as: e.coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. in more distant bacteria, y.frederiksenii and p.mirabilis, the rpoh regulatory region has a distal p1-like sigma(70) promoter and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. sequences similar to the regulatory boxes were not identified in these bacteria.  this study suggests that the general pattern of transcription of the rpoh gene in enteric bacteria includes a distal sigma(70) promoter, >200 nt upstream of the initiation codon, and two proximal promoters: a heat-induced sigma(e)-like promoter and a sigma(70) promoter. a second proximal sigma(70) promoter under catabolite-regulation is probably present only in bacteria closely related to e.coli.

TI  == bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background and aims: the gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. the aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria,  a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. methods: antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive pathogens. inhibition of salmonella typhimurium sl1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using caco-2  cells. colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic c3/he/oujco mice. antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo  in axenic c3/he/oujco mice infected by the lethal s typhimurium c5 strain. results: fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were  examined for antimicrobial activity. two strains (ca1 and f9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular s typhimurium sl1344 in caco-2 cells. an antibacterial component(s) produced by ca1 and f9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. in the axenic c3/he/oujco mice, ca1 and f9  strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against s typhimurium c5 lethal infection. conclusion: several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.

TI  == web-based visualization tools for bacterial genome alignments.
AB  == with the increase in the flow of sequence data, both in contigs and whole genomes, visual aids for comparison and analysis studies are becoming imperative. we describe three web-based tools for visualizing alignments of bacterial genomes. the first, called enteric, produces a graphical, hypertext view of pairwise alignments between a reference genome and sequences from each of several related organisms, covering 20 kb around a user-specified position. insertions, deletions and rearrangements relative to the reference genome are color-coded, which reveals many intriguing differences among genomes. the second, menteric, computes and displays nucleotide-level multiple alignments of the same sequences, together with annotations of orfs and regulatory sites, in a 1 kb region surrounding a given address. the third, a java-based viewer called maj, combines  some features of the previous tools, and adds a zoom-in mechanism. we compare the escherichia coli k-12 genome with the partially sequenced genomes of klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia pestis, vibrio cholerae, and the salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium, typhi and paratyphi a. examination of the pairwise and multiple alignments in a region allows one to draw inferences about regulatory patterns and functional assignments. for example, these tools revealed that rffh, a gene involved in enterobacterial common antigen (eca) biosynthesis, is partly deleted in one of the genomes. we used pcr to show that this deletion occurs sporadically in some strains of some serovars of s.enterica subspecies i but not  in any strains tested from six other subspecies. the resulting cell surface diversity may be associated with selection by the host immune response.

TI  == a trans-acting rna as a control switch in escherichia coli: dsra modulates function by forming alternative structures.
AB  == dsra is an 87-nucleotide regulatory rna of escherichia coli that acts in trans by rna-rna interactions with two different mrnas, hns and rpos. dsra has opposite effects on these transcriptional regulators. h-ns levels decrease, whereas rpos (final sigma(s)) levels increase. here we show that dsra enhances hns mrna turnover yet stabilizes rpos mrna, either directly or via effects on translation. computational and rna footprinting approaches led to a refined structure for dsra, and a model in which dsra interacts with the hns mrna start and stop codon  regions to form a coaxial stack. analogous bipartite interactions exist in eukaryotes, albeit with different regulatory consequences. in contrast, dsra base pairs in discrete fashion with the rpos rna translational operator. thus, different structural configurations for dsra lead to opposite regulatory consequences for target rnas.

TI  == hadrurin, a new antimicrobial peptide from the venom of the scorpion hadrurus aztecus.
AB  == a new antimicrobial peptide, hadrurin, was isolated from the venom of the mexican scorpion hadrurus aztecus, by gel filtration on a sephadex g-50 column, followed  by high performance liquid chromatography. it is a basic peptide composed of 41 amino-acid residues with a molecular mass of 4436 da, and contains no cysteines.  a model of the three-dimensional folding of hadrurin is compatible with that of an amphipatic molecule with two alpha-helical segments. hadrurin demonstrates antimicrobial activity at low micromolar concentration, inhibiting the growth of  bacteria such as: salmonella thyphi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and serratia marscences. it also shows cytolytic activity when tested in human erythrocytes. hadrurin and two analogs (c-terminal amidated, and all d-enantiomer) were chemically synthesized. they were used to study the possible molecular mechanism of action by testing their ability to dissipate the diffusion potential of liposomes of different compositions. the results obtained indicate that there are no specific receptor molecules for the action of hadrurin, and the most probable mechanism is through  a membrane destabilization activity. it is surmised that hadrurin is used by the  scorpion as both an attack and defense element against its prey and putative invasive microorganisms. it is a unique peptide among all known antimicrobial peptides described, only partially similar to the n-terminal segment of gaegurin  4 and brevinin 2e, isolated from frog skin. it would certainly be a model molecule for studying new antibiotic activities and peptide-lipid interactions.

TI  == [typing of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing salmonella typhimurium strains isolated in a pediatric unit].
AB  == extended-spectrum b-lactamases (esbls) derive mainly from tem and shv b-lactamases. these enzymes confer resistance to all oxyimino cephalosporins and  monobactams except cephamycins and carbapems. esbls are often encoded by large plasmids that carry resistance determinants to multiple antibiotics and spread among the members of the enterobacteriaceae. since the first outbreak of klebsiella pneumoniae expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase reported in  1984, nosocomial infections due to enterobacteriaceae species which produce esbls have been generally recovered from patients hospitalized in intensive care units. the most frequently isolated esbl-producing strains belong to the genus klebsiella, escherichia, enterobacter and proteus; esbls are rarely associated with the genus salmonella. the first salmonella were detected in france in 1984 (salmonella typhimurium), in tunisia in 1988 (salmonella wien) and in argentina in 1991 (salmonella typhimurium). in 1994, 10 isolates of salmonella typhimurium  expressing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were isolated for the first time from 10 children hospitalized in a pediatric unit of the hospital ibn-rochd, casablanca. previous study showed that all isolates belonged the same serotype, and biotype, and showed a resistance to oxyimino beta-lactams, gentamycin, tobramycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but remained susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and quinolones. oxyimino beta-lactams resistance determinant of all strains of salmonella typhimurium was transferred by conjugation to escherichia coli; resistance to gentamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also cotransferred. in this study, we characterized the relationship between all isolates by comparing plasmid profiles and patterns of proteins because there appear to be the more effective method for evaluating epidemiologic relationship between salmonella species, and the protein profiles method has been used for many bacterial species. these two methods have  the advantages of speed and simplicity. all isolates presented the same plasmid pattern characterised by three plasmids and the same pattern of proteins composed of 36 bands. we concluded by combining results that this outbreak involved the spread of the same strain of salmonella typhimurium between the ten children. as  this type of resistance is easily transferred by these isolates to other bacterial species, the major risk would be its transfer to salmonella typhi.

TI  == comparison of the escherichia coli k-12 genome with sampled genomes of a klebsiella pneumoniae and three salmonella enterica serovars, typhimurium, typhi  and paratyphi.
AB  == the escherichia coli k-12 genome (eco) was compared with the sampled genomes of the sibling species salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium, typhi and paratyphi a (collectively referred to as sal) and the genome of the close outgroup klebsiella pneumoniae (kpn). there are at least 160 locations where sequences of  >400 bp are absent from eco but present in the genomes of all three sal and 394 locations where sequences are present in eco but close homologs are absent in all sal genomes. the 394 sequences in eco that do not occur in sal contain 1350 (30.6%) of the 4405 eco genes. of these, 1165 are missing from both sal and kpn.  most of the 1165 genes are concentrated within 28 regions of 10-40 kb, which consist almost exclusively of such genes. among these regions were six that included previously identified cryptic phage. a hypothetical ancestral state of genomic regions that differ between eco and sal can be inferred in some cases by  reference to the genome structure in kpn and the more distant relative yersinia pestis. however, many changes between eco and sal are concentrated in regions where all four genera have a different structure. the rate of gene insertion and  deletion is sufficiently high in these regions that the ancestral state of the eco/sal lineage cannot be inferred from the present data. the sequencing of other closely related genomes, such as s.bongori or citrobacter, may help in this regard.

AB  == the propanediol utilization (pdu) operon of salmonella typhimurium encodes proteins required for the catabolism of propanediol, including a coenzyme b12-dependent propanediol dehydratase. a clone that expresses propanediol dehydratase activity was isolated from a salmonella genomic library. dna sequence analysis showed that the clone included part of the pduf gene, the pduabcde genes, and a long partial open reading frame (orf1). the clone included 3.9 kbp of pdu dna which had not been previously sequenced. complementation and expression studies with subclones constructed via pcr showed that three genes (pducde) are necessary and sufficient for propanediol dehydratase activity. the function of orf1 was not determined. analyses showed that the s. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was related to coenzyme b12-dependent glycerol dehydratases from citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae. unexpectedly, the s. typhimurium propanediol dehydratase was found to be 98% identical in amino acid sequence to the klebsiella oxytoca propanediol dehydratase; this is a much higher identity than expected, given the relationship between these organisms. dna sequence analyses also supported previous studies indicating that the pdu operon was inherited along with the adjacent cobalamin biosynthesis operon by a single horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == gene organisation and regulatory sequences in the sucrose utilisation cluster of  bacillus stearothermophilus nub36.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the surp and surt genes in a sucrose-utilisation cluster cloned from bacillus stearothermophilus nub36 was determined. the surp gene encoded a protein of 466 amino acid residues and shared 60-62% amino acid identity with the sucrose-specific enzyme ii components of the phosphotransferase system of bacillus subtilis, salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae. surp, like other sucrose eiis, lacked the hydrophilic domain containing the first (iia) phosphorylation site. the surt gene encoded a 278 amino acid polypeptide which showed 63.1% and 54% amino acid identity to the b. subtilis antiterminators sact and sacy, respectively. a region containing a palindromic structure preceding surp was highly homologous to the regulatory transcription termination  regions of the sacpa and sacb operons of b. subtilis and the bgl operon of escherichia coli. hence the sucrose gene cluster of b. stearothermophilus nub36 is very similar to the b. subtilis sacpa operon in terms of gene order and regulatory organisation.

TI  == the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected  by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.

TI  == invasion of cultured human epithelial cells by klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the urinary tract.
AB  == the mechanisms which enable entry into cultured human epithelial cells by klebsiella pneumoniae were compared with those of salmonella typhi ty2. k. pneumoniae 3091, isolated from a urine sample of a patient with a urinary tract infection, invaded human epithelial cells from the bladder and ileocecum and persisted for days in vitro. electron microscopic studies demonstrated that k. pneumoniae was always contained in endosomes. the internalization mechanism(s) triggered by k. pneumoniae was studied by invasion assays conducted with different inhibitors that act on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures and processes. chloramphenicol inhibition of bacterial uptake revealed that bacterial de novo protein synthesis was essential for efficient invasion by k. pneumoniae and s. typhi. interference with receptor-mediated endocytosis by g-strophanthin or monodansylcadaverine and inhibition of endosome acidification by monensin reduced the number of viable intracellular k. pneumoniae cells, but not s. typhi  cells. the depolymerization of microfilaments by cytochalasin d inhibited the uptake of both bacteria. microtubule depolymerization caused by colchicine, demecolcine, or nocodazole and the stabilization of microtubules with taxol reduced only the invasion ability of k. pneumoniae. s. typhi invasion was unaffected by microtubule depolymerization or stabilization. these data suggest that the internalization mechanism triggered by k. pneumoniae 3091 is strikingly  different from the solely microfilament-dependent invasion mechanism exhibited by many of the well-studied enteric bacteria, such as enteroinvasive escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella, and yersinia strains.

AB  == a laboratory reactor, which simulates biofilm formation in water pipes, was used  to study interactions in biofilm formation between a nitrogen-fixing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enteritidis. the level of attachment of salm. enteritidis was higher in the binar biofilm than in the single species biofilm. in the initial colonization phase the binary biofilm contained a much higher proportion of metabolically active cells than in single species biofilms formed by either salm. enteritidis or kl. pneumoniae. when a pulse of salm. enteritidis was passed over an already established biofilm of kl. pneumoniae it rapidly became integrated into the biofilm, from where it was subsequently released into the water column, along with kl. pneumoniae. klebsiella pneumoniae  fixed nitrogen in the presence of salm. enteritidis in both types of biofilm.

TI  == the nucleoside-specific tsx channel from the outer membrane of salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes: functional characterization and dna sequence analysis of the tsx genes.
AB  == the escherichia coli tsx gene encodes an integral outer-membrane protein (tsx) that functions as a substrate-specific channel for deoxynucleosides and the antibiotic albicidin, and also serves as a receptor for bacteriophages and colicins. we cloned the structural genes of the tsx proteins from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes and expressed them  in an e.coli tsx mutant. the heterologous tsx proteins fully substituted the e.coli tsx protein with respect to its function in deoxynucleoside and albicidin  uptake, and as receptor for colicin k. the tsx proteins from k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes were also proficient as receptors for several tsx-specific bacteriophages, whereas the corresponding protein from s. typhimurium did not confer sensitivity against these phages. the nucleotide sequence of the tsx genes from s. typhimurium, k. pneumoniae and ent. aerogenes was established. each of the tsx proteins is initially synthesized with typical bacterial signal sequence  peptides and the predicted mature forms of the tsx proteins have a calculated m(r) of 30,567 (265 residues), 31,412 (272 residues) and 31,477 (272 residues), respectively. multiple sequence alignments between the tsx proteins showed a high degree of sequence identity and revealed the presence of four hypervariable regions, which are thought to constitute segments of the polypeptide chain exposed at the cell surface. most notable was a deletion of 8 amino acids in one  of these hypervariable domains in the s. typhimurium tsx protein. when this deletion was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the corresponding region of the e.coli tsx gene, the mutant tsx-515 protein lost its phage receptor function but still served as a colicin k receptor and as a substrate-specific channel, indicating that the region between residues 198 and 207 might be part of the bacteriophage receptor area. multiple sequence alignments, structural predictions and the properties of previously characterized tsx missense mutants were taken into account to develop a two-dimensional model for the topological organization of the tsx protein within the outer membrane.

TI  == mutational analysis of the cita citrate transporter from salmonella typhimurium:  altered substrate specificity.
AB  == the cita citrate transporter in salmonella typhimurium is encoded by the cita gene and consists of 434 amino acid residues that probably include 12 membrane-spanning segments [shimamoto. t., et al. (1991) j. biochem. 110, 22-28]. cita mutants with altered substrate specificities were isolated by in vitro mutagenesis using nitrous acid. the mutants could grow on isocitrate as a sole carbon source which normally cannot be transported well by the cita transporter of s. typhimurium. the mutation sites in the cita gene of the nine mutants were determined to involve single residues at seven sites (one mutation per mutant). the original amino acid residues at these sites (arg-19, ala-38, glu-51, gly-132, ala-169, pro-262 and leu-271) were identified to be responsible for the altered substrate specificity. all these amino acid residues were conserved in four other homologous citrate transporters from escherichia coli, citrobacter amalonaticus and klebsiella pneumoniae and are suggested to be involved in substrate recognition by the cita transporter.

TI  == growth suppression in early-stationary-phase nutrient broth cultures of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli is genus specific and not regulated by sigma s.
AB  == we have studied the growth suppression seen in early-stationary-phase lb broth cultures of salmonella typhimurium. multiplication of small numbers of an antibiotic-resistant s. typhimurium mutant was prevented when the mutant was added to 24-h cultures of the antibiotic-sensitive parent strain, whereas an antibiotic-resistant mutant of an escherichia coli strain added to the same culture grew well. a 24-h e. coli culture produced a similar specific bacteriostatic inhibition against e. coli. in older cultures, a specific bactericidal effect similar to that observed by m. m. zambrano and r. kolter (j.  bacteriol. 175:5642-5647, 1993) was also observed. whether incubated statically or shaken, sufficient nutrients were present in the filtered supernatants of 24-h cultures for small inocula of the same strain to multiply to ca. 10(9) cfu/ml after reincubation. introduction of the rpos mutation had no effect on the specific bacteriostatic inhibition. similar specific inhibition was also observed in strains of citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and shigella spp. experiments in which the 24-h culture was physically separated from the antibiotic-resistant mutant by using a dialysis membrane were carried out. these results indicated that the inhibition might be mediated by a diffusible but labile chemical mediator.

TI  == biofilm formation by the enterobacteriaceae: a comparison between salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli and a nitrogen-fixing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == a simple laboratory reactor, which simulates biofilm formation in pipes, was used to compare biofilm formation by three members of the enterobacteriaceae, namely,  an environmental, nitrogen-fixing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, a pathogen, salmonella enteritidis, and a faecal indicator, escherichia coli. all three attached to cvcp pipe surfaces in the reactor and formed substantial biofilm populations of over a million bacteria cm-2 within 24 h. these populations increased by approximately 10-fold over the next 48 h. estimates of the numbers of metabolically active cells and the ratios of viable to direct counts showed that kl. pneumoniae formed the densest and most metabolically active biofilms, followed by salm. enteritidis and e. coli, respectively. nitrogen fixation and polysaccharide production (eps) by kl. pneumoniae occurred only in mature biofilms and were of no selective advantage in the initiation of biofilms. despite producing more eps the rate of attachment of salm. enteritidis was lower  than for kl. pneumoniae.

TI  == comparative microbicidal activity of synovial fluid on arthritogenic organisms.
AB  == there is strong circumstantial evidence to support the concept that local microbial antigens play a key role in the synovitis of reactive arthritis (rea) patients. it is not at all clear whether these antigens reflect the sequelae of previously viable organisms once resident in the joint. to address the microbicidal activity of synovial fluid (sf) we performed quantitative cultures of arthritogenic organisms (salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae) and controls (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) in the presence of sf from patients with rea. there was a dramatic inhibitory effect of  sf on the gram-negative organisms (mean 1.35x10(5) organisms at 3h; 0 organisms at 24 h) in contrast to staph. aureus (1.61x10(5) at 3h; 5.70x10(5) at 24 h). this sf bactericidal phenomenon was observed in 11/11 rea patients, 5/8 rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients and 1/8 osteoarthritis (oa) patients. using a  sandwich elisa, we measured sf levels of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi). bpi was detectable in all rea sf (range 4.6-333ng/ml)) and ra sf (range 343-2570ng/ml), but was absent in 5/6 oa sf tested. anti-bpi antibodies, however, did not fully neutralize the bactericidal activity of inflammatory sf. in contrast to the sf effects observed on gram-negative bacteria, chlamydia trachomatis cultured within hela cells thrived in the presence of sf. indeed extracellular chlamydia could easily be passaged through cultured synovial fibroblasts in the presence of sf. these findings indicate that the potent microbicidal activity of sf may account for the failure to recover viable organisms from the joint in rea. chlamydia alone amongst these organisms demonstrates resistance to microbicidal effect of sf, which may relate to the pathogenesis of chlamydia-induced arthritis.

AB  == in a number of mammalian cell types, pteridine biosynthesis from guanosine 5'-triphosphate and formation of nitric oxide from l-arginine are induced by gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). we assessed  the possibility of using such metabolic alterations for the in vitro detection of pyrogens. products from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and related synthetic compounds were tested for their potential to induce either of these pathways. stimulation of pteridine biosynthesis was monitored as the formation of neopterin in the human myelomonocytic cell line thp-1. the formation of nitric oxide was determined as nitrite in murine j774a.1 macrophage cultures. the substances tested included toxic and detoxified parts of lps and lipid a from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella minnesota, and klebsiella pneumoniae as well as lipoteichoic acid and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 from staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, two cell wall compounds from mycobacterium tuberculosis, trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate and n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine, which are active components of freund's  adjuvant, were used. when applied as a single stimulus, only the whole lps molecule potently stimulated neopterin or nitrite formation. lipid a and products from gram-positive bacteria were weakly active. for neopterin formation, lipid a  required the presence of fetal calf serum. besides detoxified lps and independently from the presence of serum, all bacterial compounds tested strongly increased the effects mediated by ifn-gamma. our results show that bacterial pyrogens can be detected by monitoring the formation of neopterin or nitrite. this may provide a basis for the development of an in vitro assay for the detection of pyrogenic contamination with the aim of replacing the currently used animal test.

AB  == we have identified two novel salmonella typhimurium genes, invf and invg, which are required for the efficient entry of these organisms into cultured epithelial  cells. invf and invg are located immediately upstream of inve, a previously identified gene also required for salmonella entry. non-polar mutations in these  genes rendered s. typhimurium severely deficient for entry into cultured epithelial cells. the nucleotide sequences of invf and invg indicated that these  genes encode polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 24,373 and 62,275,  respectively. proteins of similar sizes were observed when invf and invg were expressed in a bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase-based expression system. comparison of the predicted sequence of invf with translated sequences in the existing databases indicated that this protein is homologous to members of the arac family of prokaryotic transcription regulators. however, mutations in invf did not significantly affect the expression of other members of the inv locus. invg was found to be homologous to members of the puld family of specialized translocases. this homology suggests that invg may be necessary for the export of invasion-related determinants or involved in the assembly of a supramolecular structure that promotes entry.

TI  == characterization of the cysb protein of klebsiella aerogenes: direct evidence that n-acetylserine rather than o-acetylserine serves as the inducer of the cysteine regulon.
AB  == the cysb gene of klebsiella aerogenes has been cloned, sequenced and shown to complement the cysteine auxotrophic phenotype of escherichia coli cysb mutants. the k. aerogenes cysb gene is predicted to encode a protein of 324 amino acid residues that shares approx. 95% sequence similarity with the salmonella typhimurium and e. coli cysb proteins. gel-retardation assays demonstrate that the purified protein binds to dna fragments containing either the k. aerogenes cysb promoter or the s. typhimurium cysjih promoter. acetylserine enhances cysb binding to the cysjih promoter fragment while diminishing its binding to the cysb promoter fragment. fluorescence-emission-spectroscopy measurements suggest strongly that n-acetylserine binds to cysb apoprotein but that o-acetylserine does not, and support the notion that n-acetylserine is the physiological inducer of cysteine biosynthesis.

TI  == anaerobic growth of salmonella typhimurium on l(+)- and d(-)-tartrate involves an oxaloacetate decarboxylase na+ pump.
AB  == we show here that the enterobacterium salmonella typhimurium lt2 has the capacity to grow anaerobically on l(+)- or d(-)-tartrate as sole carbon and energy source. growth on these substrates was na(+)-dependent and involved the l(+)- or d(-)-tartrate-inducible expression of oxaloacetate decarboxylase. the induced decarboxylase was closely related to the oxaloacetate decarboxylase na+ pump of klebsiella pneumoniae as shown by the sensitivity towards avidin, the location in the cytoplasmic membrane, activation by na+ ions, and western blot analysis with  antiserum raised against the k. pneumoniae oxaloacetate decarboxylase. participation of an oxaloacetate decarboxylase na+ pump in l(+)-tartrate degradation by s. typhimurium is in accord with results from dna analyses. the deduced protein sequence of the open reading frame identified upstream of the recently sequenced oxaloacetate decarboxylase genes is clearly homologous with the beta-subunit of l-tartrate dehydratase from escherichia coli. southern blot analysis with s. typhimurium chromosomal dna indicated the presence of probably more than one gene for oxaloacetate decarboxylase.

TI  == replicon typing characterization of plasmids encoding resistance to gentamicin and apramycin in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium isolated from human  and animal sources in belgium.
AB  == escherichia coli and salmonella strains with plasmids conferring resistance to gentamicin and apramycin have been isolated with increasing frequency both from cattle and hospital patients in belgium. the apramycin-gentamicin resistance plasmids were characterized in recipient strains by their profiles and molecular  weights using agarose gel electrophoresis, by their antimicrobial resistance patterns and by replicon typing using a series of dna probes specific for the genes controlling their systems of replication. overall, most of the plasmids differed in their dna electrophoretic patterns. seventeen different antimicrobial resistance profiles were observed, and there were six different types of replicons. however, two replication genes predominated and had a preferential distribution in different bacterial species. the rep fic.a plus rep q multireplicon was found mainly in plasmids recovered from gentamicin- and apramycin-resistant e. coli while replicon of the type rep fic.b largely prevailed in s. typhimurium. identical replication genes were found in most animal and human strains, hence suggesting a high homology between apramycin-gentamicin plasmids in these communities. finally, our results indicate that the rapid spread of apramycin-gentamicin-resistance in several species of enterobacteriaceae isolated from animals and from humans in belgium is not due to a single plasmid, but rather that the gene encoding aac(3)-iv is carried by various replicons.

AB  == the scr regulon of pur400 and the chromosomally encoded scr regulon of klebsiella pneumoniae kay2026 are both negatively controlled by a specific repressor (scrr). as deduced from the nucleotide sequences, both scrr genes encode polypeptides of  334 residues (85.5% identical base pairs, 91.3% identical amino acids), containing an n-terminal helix-turn-helix motif. comparison with other regulatory proteins revealed 30.6% identical amino acids to frur, 27.0% to lacl and 28.1% to galr. six scrrs super-repressor mutations define the inducer-binding domain. the  scr operator sequences were identified by in vivo titration tests of the sucrose  repressor and by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays. d-fructose, an intracellular product of sucrose transport and hydrolysis, and d-fructose 1-phosphate were shown to be molecular inducers of both scr regulons. an active scrr-frur hybrid repressor protein was constructed with the n-terminal part of the sucrose repressor of k. pneumoniae and the c-terminal part of the fructose repressor of salmonella typhimurium lt2. gel retardation assays showed that the hybrid protein bound to scr-specific operators, and that d-fructose 1-phosphate,  the inducer for frur, was the only inducer. in vivo, neither the operators of the fru operon nor of the pps operon, the natural targets for frur, were recognized,  but the scr operators were. these data and the data obtained from the super-repressor alleles confirm previous models on the binding of repressors of the lacl family to their operators.

AB  == platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. the blood was inoculated with one of five  species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per ml. the growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees c storage period of the platelet concentrates. one species, klebsiella pneumoniae,  failed to grow in any of the components. the remaining species, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by day 3. although the concentration of bacteria immediately after  inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.

AB  == a genomic library of salmonella typhimurium dna was constructed in the lambda-phage embl3 and screened by immunoblotting for expression of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase alpha-subunit. after subcloning on plasmids the entire sequence of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase was determined. the genes encoding subunits gamma (oadg), alpha (oada), and beta (oadb) of the decarboxylase are clustered on the chromosome in that order. a typical consensus sequence of a promoter is not found upstream of the oadg gene, but putative ribosome binding regions can be identified before each subunit gene. the amino acid sequences are  highly homologous to those of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from klebsiella pneumoniae with 71% identity between the gamma-subunits, 92% identity between the alpha-subunits, and 93% identity between the beta-subunits. the homology between  the corresponding beta-subunits appeared to exist only between the 312 n-terminal amino acid residues. it was shown that a cloning artifact has occurred during dna sequence determination of the beta-subunit from k. pneumoniae and has led to erroneous results. the sequence of this polypeptide is corrected in the appendix  to this paper. a plasmid encoding the three oad genes and that for the anaerobic  citrate carrier (cits) was cloned from the chromosomal dna and used for sequence  determination.

(1990) j. cell biol. 111, 1363-1371]. these proforms have been purified to homogeneity from granule extracts by immunoaffinity and reverse-phase chromatography. while mature bactenecins efficiently kill escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6-12 micrograms/ml, probac5 and probac7 do not affect the growth of the same microorganisms, even at 500 micrograms/ml. previous investigations have suggested that the conversion of probactenecins into mature antimicrobial peptides is catalyzed by a neutral serine protease stored in the azurophil granules. purified probac5 and probac7 were thus treated with elastase, cathepsin g or proteinase 3, which constitute the pool of neutral serine proteases of the azurophils, and the  reaction products were identified by western blot analysis, mass spectrometry, and n-terminal sequence analysis. of the three proteases, only elastase is able to catalyze the stepwise cleavage of probactenecins into the corresponding mature peptides, which have the same mass, n-terminal sequence and antibiotic activity of authentic bac5 and bac7. these results point to the importance of cooperation  between azurophils and large granules in mounting a defense reaction.

TI  == distribution of an l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

AB  == rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria,  such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid,  277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did  not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither  np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.

TI  == remnants of an ancient pathway to l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine in enteric bacteria: evolutionary implications and biotechnological impact.
AB  == the pathway construction for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in escherichia  coli is atypical of the phylogenetic subdivision of gram-negative bacteria to which it belongs (r. a. jensen, mol. biol. evol. 2:92-108, 1985). related organisms possess second pathways to phenylalanine and tyrosine which depend upon the expression of a monofunctional chorismate mutase (cm-f) and cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (cdt). some enteric bacteria, unlike e. coli, possess either cm-f or  cdt. these essentially cryptic remnants of an ancestral pathway can be a latent source of biochemical potential under certain conditions. as one example of advantageous biochemical potential, the presence of cm-f in salmonella typhimurium increases the capacity for prephenate accumulation in a tyra auxotroph. we report the finding that a significant fraction of the latter prephenate is transaminated to l-arogenate. the tyra19 mutant is now the organism of choice for isolation of l-arogenate, uncomplicated by the presence of other cyclohexadienyl products coaccumulated by a neurospora crassa mutant that had previously served as the prime biological source of l-arogenate. prephenate aminotransferase activity was not conferred by a discrete enzyme, but rather was  found to be synonymous with the combined activities of aspartate aminotransferase (aspc), aromatic aminotransferase (tyrb), and branched-chain aminotransferase (ilve). this conclusion was confirmed by results obtained with combinations of aspc-, tyrb-, and ilve-deficient mutations in e. coli. an example of disadvantageous biochemical potential is the presence of a cryptic cdt in klebsiella pneumoniae, where a mutant carrying multiple enzyme blocks is the standard organism used for accumulation and isolation of chorismate.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == genes rplj, coding for ribosomal protein l10 of salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae, have been cloned on puc plasmid. the resultant multicopy recombinant plasmids were detrimental for the growth of normal jm101 e. coli host cells and harmless for the mutant jf3029 host. this negative effect is the evidence for the ability of heterologous l10 proteins to regulate expression of rpljl genes in e. coli. nucleotide sequence was determined completely for s. typhimurium rpljl' dna portion and partially for rpljl' genes of k. pneumoniae. according to the nucleotide sequence data obtained three amino acid substitutions differ l10 proteins of s. typhimurium and e. coli and the long range, providing for the coupled translations of l10 and l7/l12 cistrons in e. coli mrna is also valid for s. typhimurium and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  == thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (tsb). as blood cultures are often used for  the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in tsb. routine blood culture samples from  yonsei medical center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of tsb and thiol  broth. the media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain co2,  but tsb contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (sps). growth of s. paratyphi-a, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were similar in both media. however, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in tsb with s. typhi, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. it is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to tsb plus sps for the culture of s. typhi from blood.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

AB  == the male and malk genes from salmonella typhimurium, and the malefg operon and a  portion of malk from enterobacter aerogenes were cloned and sequenced. plasmid-borne male genes from both species and the malf and malg genes from e. aerogenes were expressed normally in escherichia coli, and their products function in maltose transport. this shows that the malb products from the three species are interchangeable, at least in the combinations tested. the general genetic organization of the malb region is conserved. potential binding sites and distances between them are highly conserved in the regulatory intervals. an unexpected conserved region was detected, which we call the u box, and which could be another target for a regulatory protein. this hypothesis is supported by the presence of the u box in the regulatory region of the pula-malx operon in klebsiella pneumoniae. the intergenic region between male and malf from s. typhimurium and e. aerogenes, contains inverted repeats similar to the palindromic units (pu or rep) found at the same location in e. coli. the predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins showed 90% or more identity in every pairwise comparison of species.

TI  == isolation and characterization of oxaloacetate decarboxylase of salmonella typhimurium, a sodium ion pump.
AB  == anaerobic growth of salmonella typhimurium on citrate is na+-dependent and requires induction of the necessary enzymes during a 20-40 h lag phase. the citrate fermentation pathway involves citrate lyase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase. the decarboxylase is a membrane-bound, na+-activated, biotin-containing enzyme that functions as a na+ pump. oxaloacetate decarboxylase was isolated by affinity chromatography of a triton x-100 extract of the bacterial membranes on avidin-sepharose. the enzyme consists of three subunits alpha, beta, gamma, with apparent molecular weights of 63,800, 34,500 and 10,600. the alpha-chain contains a covalently attached biotin group and binds to antibodies raised against the alpha-subunit of oxaloacetate decarboxylase from klebsiella pneumoniae. the na+ transport function was reconstituted by incorporation of the purified enzyme into proteoliposomes.

TI  == evolution of aminobenzoate synthases: nucleotide sequences of salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella aerogenes pabb.
AB  == p-aminobenzoate synthase (ps) and anthranilate synthase (as) are structurally related enzymes that catalyze similar reactions and produce similar products, para- and ortho-aminobenzoate (anthranilate). each enzyme is composed of two non-identical subunits: a glutamine amidotransferase subunit (coii) and a subunit that produces an aminobenzoate product (coi). nucleotide sequence comparisons of  the escherichia coli genes encoding each of the subunits suggest a common evolutionary origin for both subunits of the enzyme complexes. we report here the nucleotide sequences of the pabb genes that encode salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella aerogenes ps coi. comparative sequence information suggests that pabb  is encoded as the first gene in a multicistronic transcript. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of ps coi genes indicates that the majority of sequence identity occurs in the c-terminal two-thirds of the proteins. similarly, identities in an alignment of eight ps and as coi sequences are confined to the c-terminal segments of the proteins. secondary-structure predictions for the nine sequences suggest considerable similarity in the folding of the c-terminal portions of the aminobenzoate synthases.

AB  == ten type 1 fimbriate strains of enterobacteriaceae were examined in an in vitro adhesion assay with hep2 epithelial cells. the range of hep2 cell adhesiveness, which was characteristic for each strain, was affected by motility, type 1 fimbriation and production of mannose sensitive haemagglutinin. nevertheless, not all type 1 fimbriate strains adhered well in this model. the findings are discussed with regard to the possibility that different type 1 fimbriate enterobacteria, though all are mannose sensitive, recognize different mannose-containing receptors present or available on the surfaces of the hep2 cells.

TI  == neutralization and lipoprotein binding of lipopolysaccharides in tolerant rabbit  serum.
AB  == we examined the ability of sera drawn from rabbits made tolerant to lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli o18 to inhibit heterologous lps-induced gelation of limulus lysate. compared with a pool of pretolerant sera, a pool of tolerant sera from these rabbits neutralized 5.5-fold more lps from salmonella typhimurium, 4.9-fold more lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 10.0-fold more lps from klebsiella pneumoniae. because previous studies have found that lps bound to lipoprotein is less toxic than unbound lps, we also studied the binding of lps lipoprotein fractions in the serum pools by using fractionation with a cesium chloride-equilibrium density gradient. radiolabeled lps from e. coli o113 bound much more rapidly to lipoprotein fractions in tolerant serum than in pretolerant serum (after 11 min of incubation, 66.1% vs. 16.5% binding, respectively).

TI  == microbial ribosomal vaccines.
AB  == ribosomal vaccines have been prepared from several different bacterial, fungal, and protozoan microorganisms. most of these preparations offer a higher degree of protection than do vaccines made from the homologous whole cells, but the mode of protection is controversial. all of the reported ribosomal vaccines are contaminated with cell surface determinants. antisera raised to ribosomal preparations are directed to innate ribosomal components as well as to surface antigens. several hypotheses exist for the reported protection from disease: the  cell surface contaminants serve as the protective moieties; ribosomes act as potent adjuvants for contaminating cell surface determinants; ribosomes innately  contain antigenic determinants that cross-react with cell surface antigens; recently translated cell surface polypeptides are still attached to the ribosomal rna in the ribosomes; ribosomes migrate from the cytoplasm of the microbe to the  periphery of the cell, and ribosomal antigens are exposed on the cell surface; or ribosomes contain messenger rna and produce microbial cell surface polypeptides in immunized individuals. a short description of the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes is presented, followed by a discussion of the ability of various ribosomal vaccines  to protect against infectious agents.

TI  == interspecific reconstitution of maltose transport and chemotaxis in escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein from various enteric bacteria.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (mbp), the product of the male gene, is the primary recognition component of the transport system for maltose and maltodextrins. it is also the maltose chemoreceptor, in which capacity it interacts with the signal transducer tar (taxis to aspartate and some repellents). in studies of the maltose system in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, we found that mbp is produced by salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and serratia marcescens. mbp from  all of these species cross-reacted with antibody against the e. coli protein and  had a similar molecular weight (about 40,000). the shigella flexneri and proteus  mirabilis strains we examined did not synthesize mbp. the isoelectric points of mbp from different species varied from the acid extreme of e. coli (4.8) to the basic extreme of e. aerogenes (8.9). all species with mbp transported maltose with high affinity, although the vmax for k. pneumoniae was severalfold lower than that for the other species. maltose chemotaxis was observed only in e. coli  and e. aerogenes. in s. typhimurium lt2, tar was completely inactive in maltose taxis, although it signaled normally in response to aspartate. mbp isolated from  all five species could be used to reconstitute maltose transport and taxis in a delta male strain of e. coli after permeabilization of the outer membrane with calcium.

TI  == propanediol oxidoreductases of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. aspects of interspecies structural and regulatory differentiation.
AB  == the enzyme propanediol oxidoreductase, which converts the lactaldehyde formed in  the metabolism of fucose and rhamnose into propane-1,2-diol under anaerobic conditions, was investigated in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. structural analysis indicated that the enzymes of e. coli and k. pneumoniae have the same mr and pi, whereas that of salm. typhimurium also has the same mr but a slightly different pi. one-dimensional peptide mapping showed identity between the e. coli and k. pneumoniae enzymes when digested with  alpha-chymotrypsin, staphylococcus aureus v8 proteinase or subtilisin. in the case of salm. typhimurium, this held only for the subtilisin-digested enzymes, indicating that the hydrophobic regions were preserved to a considerable extent.  anaerobically, the three species induced an active propanediol oxidoreductase when grown on fucose or rhamnose. an inactive propanediol oxidoreductase was induced in salm. typhimurium by either fucose or rhamnose under aerobic conditions, and this was activated once anaerobiosis was established. an inactive propanediol oxidoreductase was also induced in e. coli under aerobic conditions,  but only by growth on fucose. the inactive enzyme was not induced by either of the sugars in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == recombinant plasmid conferring proline overproduction and osmotic tolerance.
AB  == a recombinant plasmid carrying the proba (pro-74) mutant allele which governs osmotic tolerance and proline overproduction was constructed by using the broad-host-range plasmid vector pqsr49. the physiological, biochemical, and genetic properties of strains carrying the pqsr49 derivatives pmj101 and pmj1, mutant and wild type, respectively, were investigated. pmj101 conferred enhanced  osmotolerance compared with strains carrying the wild type, pmj1. these results are in contrast to those obtained previously with strains carrying recombinant plasmids based on pbr322 that failed to confer the osmotic tolerance phenotype. gamma-glutamyl kinase (first step in proline biosynthesis) from strains carrying  pmj101 was 200-fold less sensitive to feedback inhibition than was the wild-type  enzyme. as expected, the intracellular proline levels of strains carrying pmj101  were more than an order of magnitude higher than those of the wild type. an analysis of copy number revealed that the pqsr49 constructs were present in the cell at a level six- to eightfold lower than those of the pbr322 recombinants, which may account for the difference in phenotype. we found that the genetic stability of the pqsr49 derivative in a variety of gram-negative bacteria was dependent on the insert orientation and the presence of foreign dna on the plasmid. these factors may be significant in future studies aimed at expanding the osmotolerance phenotype to a broad range of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == evolution of glutamine amidotransferase genes. nucleotide sequences of the paba genes from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens.
AB  == the amide group of glutamine is a source of nitrogen in the biosynthesis of a variety of compounds. these reactions are catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as glutamine amidotransferases; two of these, the glutamine amidotransferase subunits of p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase have been studied  in detail and have been shown to be structurally and functionally related. in some micro-organisms, p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase share a  common glutamine amidotransferase subunit. we report here the primary dna and deduced amino acid sequences of the p-aminobenzoate synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunits from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens. a comparison of these glutamine amidotransferase sequences to the sequences of ten others, including some that function specifically in either the p-aminobenzoate synthase or anthranilate synthase complexes and some that are shared by both synthase complexes, has revealed several interesting features of the structure and organization of these genes, and has allowed us to  speculate as to the evolutionary history of this family of enzymes. we propose a  model for the evolution of the p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunits in which the duplication and subsequent divergence of the genetic information encoding a shared glutamine amidotransferase subunit led to the evolution of two new pathway-specific enzymes.

AB  == antibiotic-resistant strains of salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae  died readily after their addition to raw sewage, but they grew in sterilized sewage. the decline was not a result of abiotic stresses, and because the bacteria were able to survive in large numbers for at least 15 days in solutions  containing no organic nutrients, it was not a result of competition. toxin production, bacteriophages, and bdellovibrio sp. did not cause the disappearance  of the two bacterial species. a decline was also evident if the sewage was first  passed through a 3-micron (pore size) filter or treated with cycloheximide or cycloheximide plus nystatin, but protozoa developed under these conditions. little or no decline occurred if the sewage was filtered and treated with the eucaryotic inhibitors before the addition of s. typhimurium or k. pneumoniae, and protozoa were not detected. s. typhimurium increased in abundance if cycloheximide, streptomycin, and erythromycin or large amounts of glucose were added to sewage. tetrahymena thermophilus did not significantly reduce the population of s. typhimurium in buffer when the density of the bacterium was about 10(4)/ml. however, when more than 10(8) enterobacter agglomerans cells per  ml were added to the buffer, t. thermophilus reduced the abundance of e. agglomerans and s. typhimurium to 10(6) and 10/ml, respectively. the density of s. typhimurium was further decreased by a second increment of e. agglomerans cells. the disappearance of s. typhimurium and k. pneumoniae from sewage thus is  the result of predation by protozoa.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == there is good evidence to show that ferric enterochelin is an essential growth factor for a number of gram-negative pathogenic bacteria exposed to the host iron binding proteins, transferrin and lactoferrin. tests of nineteen complexes of enterochelin as potential antibacterial agents showed that only those containing  either indium (in3+) or scandium (sc3+) inhibited bacterial growth. in this study, further evidence is presented which demonstrates a competition between the sc3+ and fe3+ complexes. the uptake of both complexes is energy dependent and is  also repressed in iron-replete cells. the sc3+ complex accumulates within the cells at 20% of the rate of the fe3+ complex. the main components of the ferric enterochelin transport system are required for the transport of the sc3+ complex  although some sc3+ appears to enter the cell by another route. the accumulation,  within the cell, of 14c-labelled enterochelin complexes depends on the growth medium. the relationship of the size of the metal ion to the biological activity  of the complex is discussed and possible mechanisms of action of the sc3+ complex are considered.

TI  == glycine betaine, an osmotic effector in klebsiella pneumoniae and other members of the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == osmoregulation was examined in members of the enterobacteriaceae. exogenous glycine betaine at a concentration as low as 1 mm was found to stimulate the growth rate of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae in media of inhibitory osmotic strength. the stimulation was shown to  be independent of any specific solutes, electrolytes, or nonelectrolytes. therefore, the stimulatory effect of glycine betaine was a consequence of high osmotic potential. this effect was found to be far greater than the proline effect previously observed in s. typhimurium. whereas nitrogen fixation by k. pneumoniae is completely inhibited under conditions of osmotic stress, nitrogenase activity could be partially restored by the addition of exogenous glycine betaine to the culture medium. furthermore, glycine betaine in combination with proline, especially proline produced internally at a high level  because of regulatory mutations affecting proline biosynthesis, strongly stimulated nitrogen fixation activity during osmotic stress. glycine betaine was  accumulated by the cells, and the amount taken up was correlated with the osmolarity of the medium. these findings are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms by which glycine betaine might cause enhanced osmotolerance.

AB  == natural isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and providencia stuartii were analysed to determine their plasmid content. this data allowed the identification of nosocomial strains of k. pneumoniae and p. stuartii and helped in the differentiation of epidemic strains  of e. coli 0111 and s. typhimurium. phenotypically similar isolates of s. typhimurium could be shown to be of independent origin using plasmid pattern analysis. the dissemination of a particular plasmid through different strains of  s. typhimurium resulted in a simulation of a very widely distributed epidemic strain, because the plasmid interfered with the phage type of its host strain in  addition to determining resistance properties. plasmid pattern analysis disclosed two independently existing but interacting epidemic processes: a bacterial 'epidemic' strain may become disseminated over a large territory and may predominate there for a long time; a single plasmid, however, may also become distributed through many different bacterial strains and may spread over a large  territory. plasmid pattern analysis provides a valuable and universal epidemiological laboratory method.

TI  == antibody response to the protein antigens of "salmonella typhi" during typhoid infection and following vaccination with a live oral typhoid vaccine ty21a.
AB  == two protein antigens, named as s1da and s1db, common to many gram-negative bacteria, were prepared from an extract of salmonella typhi cells. antisera to s. typhi, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, prepared by immunizing rabbits with acetone-treated cells of the corresponding bacterial species, all reacted against s1da and s1db as shown both by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (cie) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). forty nine (98%) of the 50 tested sera obtained from typhoid patients while only 4 (8%) of the 50 sera obtained from febrile non-typhoid patients showed antibodies to s1da and s1db with elisa titres above 1.000. s1da and s1db were then tested against 80 sera collected from 24 volunteers who had received a  live typhoid vaccine ty21a. those vaccinees, who had antibodies to the lps antigens of s. typhi following ty21a vaccination, also developed antibodies to both the s1da and s1db antigens. antigenically, s1da and s1db were different from each other and from the lps antigens of s. typhi. s1da and s1db were basically protein in nature, the reactivity of these antigens against a positive control antiserum was destroyed by pronase, i.e., the addition of pronase after coating the microelisa plates with s1da or s1db reduced the elisa titre to a minimum. treatment with pronase, however, did not affect the elisa titre when plates coated with the lps antigens of s. typhi were used as the solid-phase antigen.

TI  == the transfer rna of certain enterobacteriacae contain 2-methylthiozeatin riboside (ms2io6a) an isopentenyl adenosine derivative.
AB  == isopentenyl adenosine derivatives are always located adjacent to the 3' end of the anticodon in transfer rna and have been implicated in certain biological functions. in the enteric bacterium, e. coli, the derivative is ms2i6a whereas in some plant associated bacteria the derivative is the hydroxylated form, ms2io6a.  anti-i6a immunoadsorbent chromatography has been employed to detect isopentenyl adenosine compounds. in the present study we show that the transfer rna of three  species of enteric bacteria, s. typhimurium, k. pneumoniae, and s. marcescens contains both ms2io6a and ms2i6a. under the growth conditions utilized the ms2io6a is predominant. the presence of ms2io6a in enterobacteriacae is particularly noteworthy since in previous work it has been found only in plant-associated species of bacteria.

TI  == fate in model ecosystems of microbial species of potential use in genetic engineering.
AB  == the changes in populations of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, agrobacterium tumefaciens, rhizobium meliloti, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were measured after their introduction into samples of sewage, lake water, and soil. enumeration of small populations was possible because the strains used were resistant to antibiotics in concentrations and combinations such that few species native to these ecosystems were able to grow on agar containing the inhibitors. fewer than 2 cells per ml of sewage or lake water and 25 cells per g of soil could be detected. a. tumefaciens and r. meliloti persisted in significant numbers with little decline, but s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, s. typhimurium, s. cerevisiae, and  vegetative cells of b. subtilis failed to survive in samples of sewage and lake water. in sterile sewage, however, k. pneumoniae, b. subtilis, s. typhimurium, a. tumefaciens, and r. meliloti grew; s. cerevisiae populations were maintained at the levels used for inoculation; and s. aureus died rapidly. in sterile lake water, the population of s. aureus and k. pneumoniae and the number of vegetative cells of b. subtilis declined rapidly, r. meliloti grew, and the other species maintained significant numbers with little or a slow decline. the populations of  s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, a. tumefaciens, b. subtilis, and s. typhimurium declined in soil, but the first four species grew in sterile soil. it is suggested that some species persist in environments in which they are not indigenous because they tolerate abiotic stresses, do not lose viability readily  when starved, and coexist with antagonists. the species that fails to survive need only be affected by one of these factors.

TI  == common evolutionary origin of chromosomal beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteria.
AB  == a 32p-labeled fragment of dna, encoding the major part of the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase gene of escherichia coli k-12, was used as a hybridization probe for homologous dna sequences in colonies of neisseria gonorrhoeae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and different enterobacterial species. the ampc probe detected the presence of homologous dna sequences in clinical isolates of e. coli, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. no hybridization was found with n. gonorrhoeae colonies. in southern blotting experiments the ampc probe hybridized  to chromosomal dna fragments of the same size in all enterobacterial species tested. however, the degree of hybridization differed with dna from different species. dna from the shigella species strongly hybridized to the ampc probe. furthermore, antibodies raised against purified e. coli k-12 ampc beta-lactamase  precipitated beta-lactamases from the shigella species, suggesting extensive sequence similarities between the ampc genes of these genera. the production of chromosomal beta-lactamase in s. sonnei increased with increasing growth rate similar to e. coli k-12. this growth rate response was abolished in two beta-lactamase-hyperproducing s. sonnei mutants, which thus seem similar to e. coli k-12 attenuator mutants. we propose that both the structure and regulation of the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes are very similar in e. coli and in s. sonnei.

AB  == the adherence of staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3h-thymidine to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. enterobacteriaceae adhered to dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. the addition of velour to the dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. in contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. the adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. however, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.

TI  == iron-related modification of bacterial transfer rna.
AB  == transfer rnas isolated from e. coli grown in media where ferric iron is not freely available show well characterized chromatographic changes due to the absence of the methylthio moiety of ms2i6a. the altered trna molecules include trna trp trna tyr, trna phe and two minor trna ser species. it has been suggested that methylthiolation of trna affects its function in regulation. we now show iron-related changes in trna trp from s. typhimurium, ps. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. trna trp from s. typhimurium contains ms2i6a and it seems probable that the availability of iron affects the synthesis of ms2i6a-trna trp from i6a-trna trp in this organism. an iron-related methylthiolating system may also be operative in k. pneumoniae. s. marcescens trna trp, however was not affected by the availability of iron. neither ms2i6a nor i6a was found in s. marcescens trna, although an, as yet unidentified, hydrophobic nucleoside was present.

AB  == in the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the  same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. this phenomenon was observed  whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. the different response to living and  killed bacteria was also found with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii, and enterobacter aerogenes, but not with shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, and propionibacterium acnes. the results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. the experimental results obtained with motility mutants of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.

AB  == the relationship between oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [nad(p)+] transhydrogenase (ec 1.6.1.1) and nad(p)+ glutamate dehydrogenase in several enteric bacteria which differ slightly in their regulation of nitrogen metabolism was studied. escherichia coli strain k-12 was grown on glucose and various concentrations of nh4cl as the sole nitrogen source. in the range of 0.5  to 20 mm nh4cl, the energy-independent transhydrogenase increased two to threefold. comparable changes occurred in nad(p)+-linked glutamate dehydrogenase. nh4cl concentrations of 20 to 60 mm resulted in relatively constant specific activities for both enzymes. higher exogenous nh4cl, however, led to a decline in both activities. isocitrate dehydrogenase, another potential source of cellular nadph, was insensitive to nh4cl limitation. similar studies in the presence of glutamate and different exogenous nh4cl concentrations again showed concerted effects on both enzymes. growth on glutamate as the sole nitrogen source led to severe repression of both transhydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. in salmonella typhimurium, both enzymes were unaffected by limiting nh4cl or growth  on glutamate as the sole nitrogen source. both were, however, repressed by growth on aspartate, a potential source of cellular glutamate. coordinate changes in glutamate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase were also evident in klebsiella aerogenes, particularly under conditions in which glutamate dehydrogenase was regulated inversely to glutamate synthetase. coordinate changes in glutamate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase in enteric bacteria are discussed in terms of  the possible involvement of the latter enzyme as a direct source of nadph in the  ammonia assimilation system.

TI  == on the mutagenicity of nitroimidazoles.
AB  == regarding mutagenicity, metronidazole is one of the best-investigated compounds of the nitroimidazoles. this drug is mutagenic on bacteria, especially if base-pair tester strains are used and bacterial nitroreductases are present. the  serum levels attained in man after intake of this drug are sufficient to cause mutations in bacteria. furthermore, interaction with and binding to dna occurs under anaerobic conditions and sometimes dna breaks are observed. however, metronidazole does not show mutagenic activity in mammalian cells in vitro; the micronucleus test is negative and chromosome aberrations are only found under anaerobic conditions. with microbial systems the mutagenicity of 47 nitroimidazoles has been investigated. only 4 compounds were always negative in the applied test systems. because with base-pair tester strains mutagenicity was  assessed, this class of compounds should be regarded as a base-pair mutagen. in fungi, some compounds (e.g. zk 26173 and azathioprine) are potent mutagens, whilst with most investigated nitroimidazoles only a weak or no mutagenic activity could be detected. somewhat similar observations have been made in tests with drosophila melanogaster, a test for gene mutations in mammalian cells, the micronucleus test, cytogenic tests and the dominant lethal test. the reduction products of metronidazole, misonidazole and 1-methyl-2-nitro-5-vinylimidazole, cause dna damage if the nitro group is reduced in the presence of dna. reduction  products are formed by microbes in the gut or by mammalian cells under anaerobic  conditions. no teratological effect due to metronidazole or most other nitroimidazoles has been observed. metronidazole is carcinogenic in mice and rats, and dimetridazole in rats. up to the present, no carcinogenic effects have  been observed in man. azathioprine is probably carcinogenic for man. it is unlikely that the therapeutic applications of the presently used nitroimidazoles, except for azathioprine, will cause an increase in the tumor incidence in man or  will cause other genotoxic effects, although such effects cannot be excluded with certainty.

(1976) biochim. biophys. acta 454, 285-297) that components of the escherichia coli enterochelin synthetase system physicaloly associate to form enzyme complexes. evidence for the existence of three enzyme complexes, designated in order of increasing stability g-d < f-d < f-d-g, has been obtained following gel filtration and chromatography on deae-sephadex. persistence of the f-d and g-d complexes during chromatography appears to depend on the flow rate of the column. on the basis of complementation with appropriate ent mutants of e. coli, activities corresponding to those of the d, e, f and g components of enterochelin synthetase in e. coli have been detected in cell-extracts of both salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae (formerly aerobacter aerogenes) strains. these are designated d', e', f' and g' activities. components e' and g' are eluted from sephadex g-100 in similar fashion to their e. coli counterparts. peaks of f' and d' activities however, are eluted together at a position corresponding to that of the e. coli f component. we suggest that in s. typhimurium and k. pneumoniae, either a single polypeptide  combines the functions of the e. coli f and d components, or that separate f' and d' components form a stable complex and that activity of uncomplexed d' and component was not detected under the conditions used during chromatography and assay.

AB  == interaction between phage p22 and phenol-water extracted lipopolysaccharides from sensitive salmonella bacteria belonging to serogroups a, b and di results in hydrolysis of the alpha-l-rhamnosyl linkages within the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the o-antigenic polysaccharide chain. these o-antigens have identical structures except for the nature of the 3,6-dideoxy-hexosyl group linked to o-3 of the d-mannosyl residue. removal of the dideoxysugar, or periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction of the l-rhamnosyl residue made the o chain resistant to the endo-rhamnosidase. substitution of the d-galactosyl residue at o-4, but not at o-6, with an alpha-d-glucosyl group was compatible with hydrolysis. a number of klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri lipo- or capsular polysaccharides containing chain l-rhamnosyl residues were tested but none was sensitive to the p22 endo-rhamnosidase. the substrate specificity of the endo-rhamnosidase parallels the lytic specificity of the phage which suggests that the initial step in phage p22 infection is a p22 tail enzyme o-antigen substrate interaction. the main product of the hydrolysate was octa-, dodeca- and hexadecasaccharides. treatment of phage fo resistant smooth strains of s. typhimurium with p22 tails removed o polysaccharide chains and made previously 'hidden' fo receptors accessible to the phage.

TI  == experimental klebsiella and salmonella infection in neonatal swine.
AB  == twenty colostrum-fed piglets from three sows were separated from the sows 24 hours after birth and were randomly divided into five groups of four piglets each. every piglet in each of four test groups was orally inoculated with about 10(10) colony forming units of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella choleraesuis var kunzendorf or one of two isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae. one group served  as uninoculated controls. piglets infected with k. pneumoniae developed severe diarrhea beginning about 12 hours after inoculation. they became dehydrated and weak but continued to drink. there were no morphological alterations in intestinal mucosa when piglets were killed and necropsied 48 or 72 hours after inoculation. klebseilla pneumoniae was isolated from intestine and feces but not  from liver or spleen. piglets inoculated with s. choleraesuis became lethargic and disinterested in food by 24 hours after inoculation. diarrhea developed by 48 hours after inoculation. lesions at necropsy 60 or 72 hours postinoculation were  subcutaneous edema, mesenteric lymphadenitis, diffuse intestinal superficial mucosal necrosis with villous atrophy, and focal deep ulceration in the ileum. salmonella choleraesuis was isolated from all segments of intestine and from feces, liver and spleen. piglets inoculated with s. typhimurium developed a relatively mild diarrheal disease with lesions similar to those with s. choleraesuis infection but less severe. the inoculated organism was recovered from all areas of intestine and from feces, liver and spleen. serum from infected and control piglets had high (greater than 1:256) agglutinating titres against s. typhimurium but low titres (0 to 1:8) against s. choleraesuis. the agglutinins were assumed to originate from colostral antibodies.

AB  == the time course of the occurrence of hyperreactivity in interferon and cytotoxin  responses to the active substance (neutral fraction) of the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae (neutral cps-k) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and of the hyperreactivity to their lethal effects was followed after infection with bcg in sma and icr strains of mice. the duration of these hyperreactivities of bcg-infected mice depended on the inoculum doses of bcg. the time patterns of the hyperreactivity to the lethal effects of neutral cps-k and lps were similar in both strains of mice, although the maximum toxicity of lps by the intraperitoneal route in bcg-infected mice on a weight basis was stronger than that of neutral cps-k. irrespective of inducer and mouse strain, the time pattern of the hyperreactivity to produce cytotoxin was similar to that  of the hyperreactivity to produce interferon. the patterns for these phenomena when neutral cps-k was used as an inducer were also similar to those when lps was used. in icr mice the hyperreactivity in interferon and cytotoxin responses to either neutral cps-k or lps decayed significantly earlier than the hyperreactivity to their lethal effects, whereas in sma mice the occurrence of both types of hyperreactivities seemed to be associated. therefore, it is suggested that the mechanism for the hyperreactivity in interferon and cytotoxin  responses to neutral cps-k or lps in bcg-infected mice is not necessarily the same as that for the hyperreactivity to their lethal effects.

TI  == effect of capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. iii. further study of its effects on interactions between peritoneal leukocytes and virulent salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == the mechanism for the infection-promoting effect of the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae (cps-k) was investigated using the experimental system in which mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a virulent strain of salmonella enteritidis immediately after i.p. injection of cps-k. in the peritoneal phagocytes of cps-k-untreated control mice, approximately 70, 3, and 10% of phagocytized bacteria survived 6, 12, and 24 hr after challenge, respectively, when calculated from the ratio of the number of cell-associated viable bacteria, which was estimated by direct plate count, to the number of phagocytized bacteria, which was estimated by microscopic observation of stained  smears. in contrast, almost all of the phagocytized bacteria were viable throughout the experimental period in mice treated with cps-k. the electron microscopical findings of the phagocytes obtained 12 hr after challenge showed that in the cells of mice treated with cps-k almost all of the phagocytized bacteria were morphologically intact, with some of them in the stages of cell division, whereas in those of untreated control mice, almost all of the phagocytized bacteria underwent digestive changes. when the reaction product of acid phosphatase was examined by electron microscopy in the phagocytes obtained 12 hr after challenge, the enzyme activity in the phagosomes was very low in mice treated with cps-k in comparison with that in untreated control mice. enzyme assays of the lysosomal and extralysosomal fractions of peritoneal cells obtained at various times after challenge also showed that release of acid phosphatase from the lysosomal fraction to the extralysosomal fraction after bacterial challenge was inhibited in peritoneal cells of mice treated with cps-k.

TI  == interferon and cytotoxic factor (cytotoxin) released in the blood of mice infected with mycobacterium bovis bcg. i. enhanced production of interferon and appearance of cytotoxin stimulated by capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae or bacterial lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == interferon production stimulated by the active substance (neutral fraction) of the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae (neutral cps-k) in bcg-infected mice was compared with that by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). prior infection with bcg increased the responsiveness of mice to the lethal effect of neutral cps-k as well as to that of lps. associated with this, bcg-infected mice showed a markedly enhanced ability to produce interferon after  stimulation not only by lps but also by neutral cps-k. in addition, a cytotoxic factor (cytotoxin) was found to be released in the serum of bcg-infected mice after injection of these inducers. the kinetics of production of interferon and cytotoxin stimulated by neutral cps-k were very similar to those stimulated by lps. the time pattern of cytotoxin production was not in parallel with that of interferon production. interferon reached a peak 2 hr and cytotoxin 3 hr after injection with these inducers. interferon and cytotoxin produced by neutral cps-k showed essentially the same stabilities to heating at 56 c and to treatment at ph 2 respectively as those produced by lps. interferon was inactivated by heating at 56 c more rapidly than cytotoxin. cytotoxin was inactivated by treatment at ph 2  for 24 hr, whereas interferon activity was well preserved after this treatment. these results suggest that both activities are the result of different substances.

AB  == twelve thermosensitive h1 plasmids from strains of salmonella typhi that had caused outbreaks of chloramphenicol-resistant typhoid fever in vietnam, thailand  and india mediated citrate utilization (cit+) in a prototrophic escherichia coli  k12 strain but not in the s. typhi strains from which they were derived. four h1  plasmids from a similar outbreak in mexico differed from the far eastern plasmids in not mediating citrate utlization but in mediating mercury resistance. h1 plasmids resembling the far eastern and the mexican plasmids in regard to citrate utilization and mercury resistance were found in sewage in britain. citrate utilization was transferred to eight pathogenic strains of e. coli and to one strain each of shigella flexneri and shigella sonnei. cultures of cit+ bacteria grew more rapidly in citrate media at 28 degrees c than at 37 degrees c. plasmid  mutants that were more efficient at utilizing citrate were present in all such cultures--they grew equally well or better at 37 degrees c than at 28 degrees c.  none of 222 strains of e. coli or shigella that contained a variety of different  plasmids were able to utilize citrate. this property was not transferred to the prototrophic e. coli k12 strain from citrobacter (3 strains), salmonella (39 strains), proteus (44 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (33 strains) or pseudomonas aeruginosa (44 strains).

TI  == genetic mapping of tyramine oxidase and arylsulfatase genes and their regulation  in intergeneric hybrids of enteric bacteria.
AB  == the genes for arylsulfatase (atsa) and tyramine oxidase (tyna) have been mapped in klebsiella aerogenes by p1 transduction. they are linked to gdhd and trp in the order atsa-tyna-gdhd-trp-pyrf. complementation analysis using f' episomes from escherichia coli suggested an analogous location of these genes in e. coli,  although arylsulfatase activity was not detected in e. coli. p1 phage and f' episomes were used to create intergeneric hybrid strains of enteric bacteria by transfer of the ats and tyn genes between k. aerogenes, e. coli, and salmonella typhimurium. intergeneric transduction of the tynk gene from k. aerogenes to an e. coli restrictionless strain was one to two orders less frequent than that of the leuk gene. the tyramine oxidase of e. coli and s. typhimurium in regulatory activity resemble very closely the enzyme of k. aerogenes. the atse gene from e.  coli was expressed, and latent arylsulfatase protein was formed in k. aerogenes and s typhimurium. the results of tyramine oxidase and arylsulfatase synthesis in intergeneric hybrids of enteric bacteria suggest that the system for regulation of enzyme synthesis is conserved more than the structure or function of enzyme protein during evolution.

AB  == the capacity of mycobacteria to enhance the nonspecific resistance of mice to bacterial infections was related to the presence of cord factor. after enzymatic  digestion and delipidation, cell walls lost their immunopotentiating activity, which was restored, however, by the addition of cord factor. cord factor administered alone protected mice effectively against virulent organisms unrelated to mycobacteria. moreover, although this glycolipid is usually injected as a solution in mineral oil, our data show its effectiveness when administered in metabolizable peanut oil or even as a suspension in water. since cord factor is a chemically well-defined molecule (6,6'-trehalose dimycolate), this glycolipid should constitute a new and useful tool for the investigation of nonspecific immunity to infection.

TI  == effect of capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. ii. effects on peritoneal leukocytes of normal mice and mice infected with virulent salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == in normal mice, the total count of peritoneal leukocytes was markedly decreased after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae (cps-k) depending on the dosage injected. this decrease was mainly due to the depletion of macrophages, and a decrease in the number of lymphocytes occurred to a lesser extent. cps-k in relatively smaller doses mobilized polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (pmn) into the peritoneal fluid but it decreased them transiently in larger doses. in mice infected i.p. with a virulent strain of salmonella enteritidis, there was an abundant emigration of pmn into the peritoneal fluid. when 200 mug of cps-k was injected i.p. immediately before bacterial challenge, emigration of pmn was markedly delayed for 48 hr after infection. associated with this suppressed emigration of  pmn, the numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes in the peritoneal fluid were significantly less in mice treated with cps-k than those in untreated control mice for 48 hr after infection. the numbers of both cell-associated and extracellular bacteria in the peritoneal fluid were markedly greater in mice treated with cps-k than those in untreated control mice. in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, ingestion of bacteria by macrophages and pmn was not blocked by cps-k or neutral cps-k, the active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of cps-k. it appeared that cps-k somehow impaired the  intraphagocytic bactericidal activity.

AB  == the neutral fraction (neutral cps-k) of klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (cps-k) from type 1, kasuya strain, has already been reported as the active substance responsible for the strong adjuvant effect of cps-k. the present results demonstrate that neutral cps-k exhibits further common biological activities with lipopolysaccharide (lps) isolated from salmonella enteritidis. the intensity of the lethality in mice of neutral cps-k by the intraperitoneal route is very similar to that of lps. its lethality for mice by the intravenous (i.v.) route is significantly stronger than that of lps, because the degree of increase in the sensitivity to their lethality by i.v. challenge is smaller for lps than for neutral cps-k. the intensity of the pyrogenicity of neutral cps-k in rabbits is approximately one-tenth of that of lps as judged by the minimal pyrogenic doses and fever indices. the skin-preparatory potency of neutral cps-k  for the dermal shwartzman phenomenon in rabbits is also approximately one-tenth of that of lps compared on the basis of the minimal skin-preparatory doses. when  injected i.v., neutral cps-k exhibits a provocative effect on hemorrhagic reactions in skin sites prepared with neutral cps-k or lps.

AB  == when klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (cps-k) from type 1, kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with salmonella enteritidis nub 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with s.  enteritidis nub 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. the promotion of infection with s. enteritidis nub 1 by cps-k depended upon its dose, the effect of cps-k being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. in the case of s. enteritidis nub 31, the effect of cps-k was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. as a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that cps-k promoted in vivo growth of s. enteritidis nub 1 and nub 31. in addition, cps-k enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus pneumoniae. the peak cps-k effect on infection with s. enteritidis  nub 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. the active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of cps-k was neutral cps-k, which is distinct from the o antigen and from acidic cps-k (the type-specific capsular antigen). preparations of neutral cps-k isolated from the  other three strains of k. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the kasuya strain. neutral cps-k, with identical antigenicity to that from the kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. no parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and  adjuvant activity of neutral cps-k.

(i) their splenic lymphocytes were stimulated by various gram-negative mitogens such as an escherichia coli peptidoglycan, a detoxified derivative of lps, and even endotoxins extracted by trichloroacetic acid that are known to contain protein; spleen cells of these mice were also transformed by two other b-cell mitogens extracted from acid-fast organisms. (ii) their macrophages were refractory to lps and weakly responsive to a mycobacterial prepartion. (iii) lps failed to elicit nonspecific resistance in these mice against klebsiella pneumoniae infection. (iv) endotoxin extracted by trichloroacetic acid and a mycobacterial preparation that could increase nonspecific resistance to infection in other strains did not protect c3h/he mice  against a challenge by k. pneumoniae, although both prepartions could evoke nonspecific responses of b cells in this low-responder subline.

AB  == a his+ nif+ escherichia coli k12, hfr strain (unf43) was constructed by an intergeneric mating between a klebsiella pneumoniae donor strain (hf3) and a his-hfr e. coli strain (sbi824) which transfers his as an early marker. an f-prime nif plasmid, fn39, carrying genes which correspond to the e. coli chromosomal region, metg gnd his shia, but excluding purf and arod, was isolated  from unf43. translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a p-type r-factor, r68, to fn39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative f-prime, fn68. sedimentation analysis of both f-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(ccc) dna species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. it is suggested that the two smallest ccc-dna species are component replicons of the composite f-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are ccc-dimers. fn68 was transferable in intergeneric matings to klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium but not to proteus mirabilis; only carbenicillin resistance and sex factor activity were transferred to erwinia herbicola. nif genes on fn68 were expressed in a nif- mutant of k. pneumoniae and also in s. typhimurium, which in conventional tests is naturally non-nitrogen-fixing; expression of the his determinant of fn68 became temperature-sensitive in s. typhimurium.

AB  == marked differences exist between antibacterial activity in human bile and broth.  whereas penicillins and cephalosporines exhibit virtually the same activity in broth and bile, tetracycline shows a great lose, and the activity of the aminoglykosides is increased in bile. minimal inhibitory concentrations of chlorampenicol and co-trimoxazole are also different in broth and human bile. the differences in activity are related to the ph although not all deviations can be  attributed to the effect of the ph. these results should be considered when treating gallbladder infections.

TI  == abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  == subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. eight species of bacteria were  grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. the resulting organisms were examined by gram stain and electron microscopy. gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of  infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.

TI  == effect of klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  == the effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats.  at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, na, and cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; hco3 transport was not affected. net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. the addition of 56 mm glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and na transport to net absorption  in both intestinal segments. the enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect  the absorption of either glucose or l-leucine. intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. these observations confirm the fact that  other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.

TI  == isolation of a hybrid f' factor-carrying escherichia coli lactose region and salmonella typhimurium histidine region, f42-400 (f' ts114 lac+, his+): its partial characterization and behavior in salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == episome f' ts114 lac+ (f42-114) was transferred into salmonella typhimurium carrying an f'his+ (fs400) episome, and fused episome f' ts114 lac+, his+ (f42-400) was obtained. episome f42-400 could be transferred to s. typhimurium, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. identification of the episome was based on: (i) temperature sensitivity of the lac+ and his+ phenotypes; (ii) the fact that f- segregants, obtained after temperature curing or acridine orange curing, were simultaneously lac- and his-; and (iii) linkage of lac+ with his+ in episomal transfers to e. coli and s. typhimurium. the frequency of episome transfer was influenced by the genotype of the donor. plasmid lt2, prevalent in s. typhimurium lt2 strains, was suggested to be responsible for the low fertility of s. typhimurium donors. episome f42-400 was capable of chromosome mobilization, and the extent of chromosome mobilization was not influenced by the presence or absence of the histidine region on the donor chromosome. growth in a defined medium with acridine orange was able to cure f42-400. the frequency of curing was increased (the frequency of his+ cells was 0.0001%) if the cells were grown at 40 c in the presence of acridine orange. selection for temperature-resistant lac+, his+ derivatives in a strain without histidine deletion yielded hfr strains. however, similar and stronger selections in strains without the chromosomal histidine region failed to yield hfr strains. our inability to obtain hfr's in strains without the chromosomal histidine region was explained by assuming that the episome f42-400 has lost the f sites involved in integration into the s. typhimurium chromosome.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == interferon production in mice by the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == the capsular polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae (cps-k) type 1, kasuya strain, induces interferon production in the blood of mice when injected intravenously. cps-k resembles bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) in the time pattern of interferon production, with peak levels 2h after injection. cps-k on a weight basis exhibits a more potent interferon-inducing effect than lipopolysaccharide. the active substance responsible for the interferon-inducing  activity of cps-k is the neutral cps-k antigen which is antigenically distinct from the o antigen and from acidic cps-k (the type-specific capsular antigen). neutral cps-k from the kasuya strain has been already found to exhibit a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. preparations of neutral cps-k from other strains of k. pneumoniae, of which adjuvant action is only very weak, exhibit interferon-inducing activity similar to the preparation from the kasuya strain. heterologous and homologous tolerance to re-induction of  interferon is produced by a prior injection (one each) of lps, neutral cps-k, and acidic cps-k. no simple correlation exists between the inducing and tolerogenic capabilities of these substances.

TI  == occurrence of the bacteriophage lambda receptor in some enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == in escherichia coli k-12, the receptor for phage lambda is an outer membrane protein which inactivates the phage in vitro. lambda receptor activity was found  in extracts from all wild strains of e. coli tested, although most of them fail to support growth of the phage. in some cases this failure is due to a masking of the receptor in vivo, the bacteria being unable to adsorb the phage or to react with antireceptor antibodies. in other cases, adsorption does occur, and the nature of the block in phage growth was not investigated. most mal+ strains of shigella have lambda receptor, whereas most mal- strains do not have it. synthesis of the lambda receptor in shigella is thus presumably controlled by the positive regulator gene of the maltose regulon as is the case in e. coli k-12. phage lambda adsorbs on many mal+ strains of shigella and even yields plaques on  some of them, although at a low frequency. no lambda receptor activity could be found in extracts of several strains of salmonella and levinea.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
