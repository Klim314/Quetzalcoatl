TI  == bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 induces tolerance in porcine intestinal epithelial  cells: study of the mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory effect.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 is able to significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells and to improve il-10 levels in cd4(+)cd25(high) foxp3(+) lymphocytes in response to heat-stable enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps), while the immunoregulatory effect of b. adolescentis atcc15705  was significantly lower than that observed for the mcc-117 strain. considering the different capacities of the two bifidobacterium strains to activate toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and their differential immunoregulatory activities in pie and immune cells, we hypothesized that comparative studies with both strains could provide important information regarding the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of bifidobacteria. in this work, we demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of b. breve mcc-117 was achieved by a complex interaction of multiple negative regulators of tlrs as well as inhibition of multiple signaling pathways. we showed that b. breve mcc-117 reduced heat-stable  etec pamp-induced nf-kappab, p38 mapk and pi3 k activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pie cells. in addition, we demonstrated that b. breve mcc-117 may activate tlr2 synergistically and cooperatively with one or more other pattern recognition receptors (prrs), and that interactions may result in a coordinated sum of signals that induce the upregulation of a20, bcl-3, tollip and sigirr. upregulation of these negative regulators could have an important physiological impact on maintaining or reestablishing homeostatic tlr signals in pie cells. therefore, in the present study, we gained insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory effect of b. breve mcc-117.

TI  == differential modulation of human intestinal bifidobacterium populations after consumption of a wild blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) drink.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gaining increasing interest as health-promoting bacteria. nonetheless, the genus comprises several species, which can exert different effects on human host. previous studies showed that wild blueberry drink consumption could selectively increase intestinal bifidobacteria, suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. this study evaluated the modulation of the most common and abundant bifidobacterial taxonomic groups inhabiting the human gut in the same fecal samples. the analyses carried out showed that b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. catenulatum/pseudocatelulatum, and b. longum subsp. longum were always present in the group of subjects enrolled, whereas b. bifidum and b. longum subsp. infantis  were not. furthermore, it was found that the most predominant bifidobacterial species were b. longum subsp. longum and b. adolescentis. the results obtained revealed a high interindividual variability; however, a significant increase of b. longum subsp. infantis cell concentration was observed in the feces of volunteers after the wild blueberry drink treatment. this bifidobacterial group was shown to possess immunomodulatory abilities and to relieve symptoms and promote the regression of several gastrointestinal disorders. thus, an increased  cell concentration of b. longum subsp. infantis in the human gut could be considered of potential health benefit. in conclusion, wild blueberry consumption resulted in a specific bifidogenic effect that could positively affect certain populations of bifidobacteria with demonstrated health-promoting properties.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == tolerance of bifidobacterium human isolates to bile, acid and oxygen.
AB  == bifidobacteria are part of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and are used as  probiotics in functional food products because of their health promoting properties. however, only few data are available on the phenotypic characteristics displayed by human bifidobacteria strain populations. in this study we compared the in vitro tolerance to acid, bile and oxygen of the largest  number of independent human intestinal strains. bile and acid tolerance varied among species and independent strains within a species: b. adolescentis strains were the most tolerant to bile followed by bifidobacterium longum and b. breve; b. longum, b. breve and b. dentium showed the highest viability levels after exposure to acid ph. oxygen tolerance was largely distributed among intestinal bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. breve and b. bifidum showed the highest oxygen tolerance. b. adolescentis showed the highest susceptibility to acid and oxygen stresses. the present study gave us the opportunity to update our knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of human intestinal bifidobacteria. b. longum and  b. breve harboured the best tolerance to oxygen, bile and acid stresses. based on such biological characters, b. longum and b. breve species showed the highest interest in terms of potential selection of human probiotics.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. one factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8, cxcl-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. the purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. il-8 gene expression and protein production in ht-29 cells were evaluated by real-time pcr  and elisa, respectively. pre-incubation of ht-29 cells with lactobacillus kefir im002, bifidobacterium adolescentis frp 61, bifidobacterium longum frp 68 and frp 69, bifidobacterium breve frp 334, and leuconostoc mesenteroides im080 significantly inhibited il-8 secretion induced by salmonella typhimurium dt104. co-culture of selected probiotics and salmonella typhimurium dt104 reduced il-8 production, while potential probiotics and lab had no effect on il-8 secretion in ht-29 cells preincubated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 prior to adding probiotics. lactobacillus kefir im002 supernatant also significantly reduced il-8 production. in conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and lab modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  == bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the  immune system. despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human  populations. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, b. breve, and b. longum. due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. negative correlations between the b. longum group and b. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between b. longum and b. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. the highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.

TI  == cloning and characterization of ginsenoside ra1-hydrolyzing beta-d-xylosidase from bifidobacterium breve k-110.
AB  == beta-d-xylosidase (e.c. 3.2.1.37) from bifidobacterium breve k-110, which hydrolyzes ginsenoside ra1 to ginsenoside rb2, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the (his6)-tagged recombinant enzyme, designated as xlybk- 110, was efficiently purified using ni(2)(+)-affinity chromatography (109.9-fold, 84%  yield). the molecular mass of xylbk- 100 was found to be 55.7 kda by sds-page. its sequence revealed a 1,347 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a protein containing 448 amino acids, which showed 82% identity (dna) to the previously reported glycosyl hydrolase family 30 of bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703. the km and vmax values toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx) were 1.45mm and 10.75 micromol/min/mg, respectively. this enzyme had ph and temperature optima at 6.0 and 45 degrees c, respectively. xylbk-110 acted to the  greatest extent on xyloglucosyl kakkalide, followed by pnpx and ginsenoside ra1,  but did not act on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-larabinofuranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, or p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-fucopyranoside. in  conclusion, this is the first report on the cloning and expression of beta-dxylosidase- hydrolyzing ginsenoside ra1 and kakkalide from human intestinal microflora.

TI  == inter-species differences in the growth of bifidobacteria cultured on human milk  oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk (hm) contains as the third most abundant component around 200 different structures of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos). hmos are the first and irreplaceable prebiotics for infants, supporting bifidobacteria as the most important bacterial group in an infant intestine. the aim of our study was to test the growth of bifidobacteria in hm and on hmos. bifidobacteria were isolated from two groups of infants. the first one (eight strains) were isolated from infants who had bifidobacteria in their feces but, after a short period of time (4 to 24 days), bifidobacteria were no longer detected in their feces (disappeared bifidobacteria [db]). the second group of bifidobacteria (eight strains) originated from infants with continual presence of bifidobacteria in their feces (persistent bifidobacteria [pb]). there were significant differences  (p < 0.05) between db and pb groups in the ability of the strains to grow in hm.  pb grew in hm, reaching counts higher than 7 log cfu/ml. in contrast, counts of db decreased from 5 to 4.3 log cfu/ml after cultivation in hm. the final ph after cultivation of bifidobacteria on hmos was 6.2 and 4.9 in dp and pb groups, respectively. in general, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. breve species were able  to utilize hmos, while b. adolescentis and b. longum subsp. longum species did not. the ability to grow in hm and to utilize hmos seem to be important properties of bifidobacteria which are able to colonize infant intestinal tract.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == immunostimulatory effect of faecal bifidobacterium species of breast-fed and formula-fed infants in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell/caco-2 co-culture system.
AB  == bifidobacterium spp. typical of the human intestinal microbiota are believed to influence the balance of immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different bifidobacterial species and their mixtures in in vitro experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and caco-2 cells. bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and two combinations  of these bifidobacteria simulating the species composition found in faecal samples from breast-fed (bf) and formula-fed (ff) infants were used. the levels of several cytokines were measured by direct stimulation of pbmc and by stimulation of a caco-2/pbmc co-culture with bifidobacteria. b. catenulatum and b. breve were the strongest enhancers of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) production  by direct stimulation of pbmc. b. longum was the highest inducer of il-10 and the lowest tnf-alpha stimulus. in the caco-2/pbmc system, b. breve was the highest inducer of il-8 production by caco-2 cells, significantly different from b. infantis, b. adolescentis and the ff mixture (p < 0.05). ifn-gamma produced by pbmc stimulated with the bf mixture (containing 22 % b. breve, compared with 7 %  in the ff mixture) was significantly higher compared with b. adolescentis, b. infantis and b. longum. b. adolescentis also inhibited ifn-gamma production compared with the ff mixture and b. longum. the proportion of different bifidobacterium strains seems to be an important determinant of the cytokine balance in the simulated intestinal environment studied. b. breve and the combination of the bifidobacterium species typically found in the microbiota of bf infants have shown the most significant effects.

TI  == oligosaccharides in 4 different milk groups, bifidobacteria, and ruminococcus obeum.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to identify a link between the total amount of breast milk oligosaccharides and faecal microbiota composition of newborns at  the end of the first month of life, with special attention paid to bifidobacteria, and establish the role, if any, of the different oligosaccharides in determining the gut microbiota composition. subjects and methods: milk oligosaccharide groups were identified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. dpcrna from newborns' faecal samples at 30 days of life  was isolated and processed by polymerase chain reaction analyses that allow the identification of 6 species of bifidobacteria (adolescentis, bifidum, breve, catenulatum, longum, infantis) and ruminococcus spp; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also performed. results: no substantial differences  in bifidobacteria species composition within milk groups 1, 2, and 3 were observed; however, infants fed with group 4 milk show a microbiota characterised  by a greater frequency of bifidobacteria adolescentis and the absence of bifidobacteria catenulatum. for the first time, a high percentage of the ruminococcus genus in infants fed with all milk groups was found. conclusions: our data show that milk groups 1, 2, and 3, containing an amount of oligosaccharides ranging within 10 to 15 g/l, share a substantially identical composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants, despite quali-quantitative difference in oligosaccharides content. newborns taking milk with only 5 g/l of oligosaccharides (group 4) harbour a different intestinal microbiota.

TI  == heterologous expression of secreted biologically active human interleukin-10 in bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == construction of bifidobacterium breve capable of production of secreted biologically active human interleukin-10 (hil-10) is described. orf coding for full-length mature human interleukin-10 was cloned into a series of expression vectors. this resulted in generation of translational fusions between hil-10 and  signal peptides sequences derived from bifidobacterium breve genes sec2, apub and b. adolescentis gene amyb under the control of constitutively active bifidobacterial promoter. we have shown that fusion to amyb signal peptide resulted in highest expression level of hil-10 at the mrna and protein level. secreted hil-10 was highly unstable in bifidobacterial culture supernatants in standard growth conditions. however, incubation of stationary cultures in buffered tissue culture medium resulted in production of stable biologically active hil-10, albeit in low amounts (1.9 ng/ml).

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of arabinoxylan-derived carbohydrates by bifidobacteria and mixed fecal microbiota.
AB  == bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703, bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and human fecal microbiota were cultivated in  vitro with d-xylose, l-arabinose, xylo-oligosaccharides (xos), and arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (axos) as carbon sources. the ph, formation of volatile fatty acids, and carbohydrate utilization profiles were followed. in the pure bifidobacteria cultures optical density and in the fecal slurries pressure and h(2) were also detected. a differing substrate preference was observed among  the various bifidobacteria strains. b. adolescentis grew on xos, slowly on d-xylose, but not on l-arabinose. in contrast, b. longum preferred l-arabinose and did not grow on pure d-xylose or xos. both strains were able to utilize axos  but with differing strategies, since after the cleavage of l-arabinose b. adolescentis consumed the xos formed, whereas b. longum fermented the l-arabinose released. b. breve grew poorly on all of the substrates provided. a bifidobacterial mixture and the fecal microbiota were able to utilize pure singly substituted axos almost completely, but pure axos with a doubly substituted xylose residue was fermented only by the fecal microbiota. thus, axos appear to be potential candidates for slowly fermenting prebiotics, but their prebiotic effects may be dependent on the type of arabinose substitution and the presence of other carbohydrates.

AB  == human milk contains approximately 200 complex oligosaccharides believed to stimulate the growth and establishment of a protective microbiota in the infant gut. the lack of scalable analytical techniques has hindered the measurement of bacterial metabolism of these and other complex prebiotic oligosaccharides. an in vitro, multi-strain, assay capable of measuring kinetics of bacterial growth and  detailed oligosaccharide consumption analysis by fticr-ms was developed and tested simultaneously on 12 bifidobacterial strains. for quantitative consumption, deuterated and reduced human milk oligosaccharide (hmo) standards were used. a custom software suite developed in house called glycolyzer was used  to process the large amounts of oligosaccharide mass spectra automatically with (13)c corrections based on de-isotoping protocols. high growth on hmos was characteristic of bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis strains, which consumed  nearly all available substrates, while other bifidobacterial strains tested, b. longum bv. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve and b. bifidum, showed low or only moderate growth ability. total oligosaccharide consumption ranged from a high of  87% for b. infantis jcm 7009 to only 12% for b. adolescentis atcc 15703. a detailed analysis of consumption glycoprofiles indicated strain-specific capabilities towards differential metabolism of milk oligosaccharides. this method overcomes previous limitations in the quantitative, multi-strain analysis  of bacterial metabolism of hmos and represents a novel approach towards understanding bacterial consumption of complex prebiotic oligosaccharides.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == anti-inflammatory effects of the genus bifidobacterium on macrophages by modification of phospho-i kappab and socs gene expression.
AB  == although beneficial roles of probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases have been reported, their direct action on immune cells has not been elucidated. in this study, we investigated how three species of bifidobacterium and enterococcus faecalis differentially modulate production of cytokines from lipopolysaccharide  (lps)-stimulated macrophages in vitro using raw264.7 cells. the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased after exposure to lps, e. faecalis alone and lps combined with e. faecalis. in contrast, il-10 mrna levels  were significantly decreased after exposure to e. faecalis compared with exposure to bifidobacterium species. when cells were exposed to bifidobacterium species combined with lps, mrna levels of il12p40 were decreased by co-culture with b. breve and b. longum, il-1 beta mrna levels were decreased by b. breve and b. adorescentis and tnf-alpha mrna levels were decreased by b. adolescentis compared with lps alone. the three species of bifidobacterium significantly inhibited phosphorylation of i kappab-alpha induced by lps. the mrna levels of socs1 and socs3 were increased by exposure to lps alone; however, the mrna levels of socs1  or socs3 were increased more by exposure to bifidobacterium species combined with lps. conversely, e. faecalis combined with lps induced significantly lower levels of socs mrna than those induced by bifidobacterium species combined with lps. these results indicated that certain species of genus bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced from lps-stimulated raw264.7 cells, which is possibly related to inhibition of i kappab-alpha phosphorylation and stimulation of socs signalling.

TI  == coculture fermentations of bifidobacterium species and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron reveal a mechanistic insight into the prebiotic effect of inulin-type fructans.
AB  == four bifidobacteria, each representing a cluster of strains with specific inulin-type-fructan degradation capacities, were grown in coculture fermentations with bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262, a strain able to metabolize both oligofructose and inulin. in a medium for colon bacteria with inulin as the sole  added energy source, the ability of the bifidobacteria to compete for this substrate reflected phenotypical variation. bifidobacterium breve yakult, a strain that was not able to degrade oligofructose or inulin, was outcompeted by b. thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262. bifidobacterium adolescentis lmg 10734, a strain that could degrade oligofructose (displaying a preferential breakdown mechanism)  but that did not grow on inulin, managed to become competitive when oligofructose and short fractions of inulin started to accumulate in the fermentation medium. bifidobacterium angulatum lmg 11039(t), a strain that was previously shown to degrade all oligofructose fractions simultaneously and to be able to partially break down inulin, was competitive from the beginning of the fermentation, consuming short fractions of inulin from the moment they appeared. bifidobacterium longum lmg 11047, representing a cluster of bifidobacteria that shared both high fructose consumption and oligofructose degradation rates and were able to perform partial breakdown of inulin, was the dominating strain in a  coculture with b. thetaiotaomicron lmg 11262. these observations indicate that distinct subgroups within the large-intestinal bifidobacterium population will be stimulated by different groups of prebiotic inulin-type fructans, a variation that could be reflected in differences concerning their health-promoting effects.

TI  == hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension as a time- and cost-effective approach for quantitative determination of bifidobacterium spp. in infant feces.
AB  == the bifidobacterium spp. present in 10 infant fecal samples (4 from infants with  eczema and 6 from healthy infants) were quantified with both hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry. the relative abundances of bifidobacterium longum and b. catenulatum with respect to the total bifidobacteria had a poor correlation (rho, <0.600; p value, >0.208), presumably due to differences in primer specificity and the level of hybridization stringency of both methods. in  contrast, the relative abundances of organisms of the genus bifidobacterium against the total amplified 16s rrna genes and those of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. breve against the genus bifidobacterium exhibited a good statistical correlation (rho, >0.783; p value, <0.066). this good comparability supports hope as a method to achieve high-throughput quantitative determination of bacterial targets in a time- and cost-effective manner.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

TI  == assessment on the fermentability of xylooligosaccharides from rice husks by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == liquors from rice husk autohydrolysis, containing xylooligosaccharides (xos), other saccharides, and nonsaccharide compounds, were refined by membrane processing to increase the proportion of substituted xos in refined liquors. xos  were assayed for composition and degree of polymerization (dp) distribution and hydrolyzed with commercial enzymes for obtaining xos with dp in the range of 2-6. nanofiltered, hydrolyzed liquors were subjected to ion exchange processing to yield a final product containing monosaccharides, xos (accounting for 55.6% of the nonvolatile solutes), and other nonvolatile compounds. the solution obtained  after enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial xylanases (in which 82.8% of xos were  in the dp range of 2-6) was examined as a medium for promoting the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis cect 5781, b. longum cect 4503, b. infantis cect 4551, and b. breve cect 4839. the growth rate of b. adolescentis (0.58 h(-1)) was higher than the ones determined for b. longum, b. infantis, and b. breve (0.37, 0.30, and 0.40 h(-1), respectively). the percentage of total xos consumption by b. adolescentis was 77% after 24 h, the highest percentage of utilization corresponding to xylotriose (90%), followed by xylobiose (84%), xylotetraose (83%), and xylopentaose (71%).

TI  == bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  == faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic bifidobacterium longum strains: 2c  and 46), placebo and commercial control (bifidobacterium lactis bb-12). the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific pcr. serum levels of the cytokines il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. the most frequently detected species were b. longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum. depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. negative correlations were observed between the levels of bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the regulatory cytokine il-10. the presence of faecal b. longum and bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum il-10. the anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum tgf-beta1 levels. this indicates that modulation of the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a  means of influencing inflammatory responses.

AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  == bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. for a better understanding of the effect of bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at  determining the impact of bifidobacterium on the t-helper 1 (t(h)1)/t(h)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. germfree mice were inoculated with bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine bifidobacterium strains  isolated from infants' fecal flora. five days after inoculation, mice were killed. transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), interleukin-4 (il-4), il-10, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, il-4, and il-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin a were quantified. two bifidobacterium species had no effect (b. adolescentis) or little effect (b. breve) on the immune system. bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  dentium, and one b. longum strain induced t(h)1 and t(h)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. one b. longum strain induced a t(h)2 orientation  with high levels of il-4 and il-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of tgf-beta gene expression in the ileum. the other two strains induced t(h)1 orientations with high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha splenocyte secretions. bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.

TI  == bifidobacteria in feces and environmental waters.
AB  == bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. the objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. genus- and species-specific 16s rrna gene pcr assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal dna extracts from 32 different animals. twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. the species-specific assays showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, and b. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described bifidobacterium spp. the b. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. in contrast, two clades containing b. thermophilum and b. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water dna extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters.  overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.

TI  == in vitro fermentability of human milk oligosaccharides by several strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the catabolism and fermentation of human  milk oligosaccharides (hmo) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. oligosaccharides were isolated from a pooled sample of human milk using solid-phase extraction, and then added to a growth medium as the sole source of fermentable carbohydrate. of five strains of bifidobacteria tested (bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum biovar longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium adolescentis), b. longum bv. infantis grew better, achieving triple the cell density then the other strains. b. bifidum did not reach a high cell density, yet generated free sialic acid, fucose and n-acetylglucosamine in the media, suggesting some capacity for hmo degradation. thin layer chromatography profiles of spent fermentation broth suggests substantial degradation of oligosaccharides by b. longum bv. infantis, moderate degradation by b. bifidum and little degradation by other strains. while all strains were able to individually ferment two monosaccharide constituents of hmo, glucose and galactose, only b. longum bv. infantis and b. breve were able to ferment glucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. these results suggest that as a potential prebiotic, hmo may selectively promote  the growth of certain bifidobacteria strains, and their catabolism may result in  free monosaccharides in the colonic lumen.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

TI  == effect of maternal consumption of lactobacillus gg on transfer and establishment  of fecal bifidobacterial microbiota in neonates.
AB  == background: establishment of the gut microbiota at birth provides a substantial source of microbial stimuli for the maturation of the immune system. deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. objective: this study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth  and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or placebo. methods: species-specific pcr was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of  mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. results: bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and b. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. at 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received l. rhamnosus gg showed a significantly higher occurrence of b. breve and lower of b. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. in addition, l. rhamnosus gg consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. conclusions: these results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of l. rhamnosus gg by the mothers.

TI  == an optimized enumeration method for sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria in water samples.
AB  == with increased focus on watershed protection under the surface water treatment rule, indicators that discriminate among sources of microbial inputs (microbial source tracking) are needed to supplement the quantitative information provided by total and fecal coliform measurements for drinking water monitoring. bifidobacteria are found in the digestive tract and feces of humans and other animals, and also in sewage. sorbitol is a food additive used exclusively in food intended for human consumption. therefore, the presence of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria in environmental waters can be indicative of sources of human fecal contamination. a series of media were evaluated using atcc cultures of b. breve and b. adolescentis, feces from different animals, and domestic wastewater  samples. the media evaluated were human bifid sorbitol agar (hbsa), modified human bifid sorbitol agar, beerens medium, modified beerens medium, reinforced clostridial agar, bim-25 medium, and modified bim-25 medium. variables such as sample preservation, incubation time, different ph indicators, plating technique, and discontinuous exposure to sorbitol were also evaluated. a series of biochemical tests were used to confirm positive colonies enumerated on the various media. membrane filtration and enumeration of sodium sulfite preserved samples on hbsa containing bromocresol purple using loose lidded plates for 48 h  provided the best recoveries for presumptive positive colonies. a number of sorbitol-fermenters that were not bifidobacteria were able to grow on all media tested, resulting in false-positives. therefore, plating on hbsa should be followed by a confirmation step when monitoring for sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria in environmental waters. a year-long sampling survey of a managed  reservoir in massachusetts provided field validation of the proposed methodology  for sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria as a human-related source tracking indicator tool.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

TI  == selection of acid tolerant bifidobacteria and evidence for a low-ph-inducible acid tolerance response in bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == acidity is an environmental condition commonly encountered by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and fermented foods. in the present study, 22 strains of bifidobacterium were screened for acid tolerance in artificial gastric juice (agj, ph 3.0) and fermented milk. agj tolerance was found to be strain-specific, with a pronounced variation among the strains. several strains with a high survival rate in agj that belonged to bifid. longum,  bifid. breve and bifid. adolescentis were selected. among them, only strain bl1 of bifid longum was found to possess a high survival rate in fermented milk during refrigerated storage. strain bl1 exhibited a survival rate of more than 25% in agj at ph 3.0 for 2 h and maintained a viable cfu level of more than 10(8) per gram of product in fermented milk (ph 4.6) under refrigerated conditions for  2 weeks. the acid tolerance of strain bl1 was found to depend on the final growth ph (<4.5). rapid loss of acid tolerance was observed when the cells were shifted  from acid to neutral conditions by addition of naoh. strain bl1 cells were able to maintain much higher intracellular ph under acid conditions, in comparison with those of agj sensitive mutant (bl1-s) or cells that lost acid tolerance following ph shifting from acid to neutral conditions. these results suggested that a cytoplasmic ph homeostasis system may function in the acid tolerance response in this strain.

TI  == development of multi-color fish method for analysis of seven bifidobacterium species in human feces.
AB  == we have developed a multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) method  which detects, by a single reaction, all seven species of bifidobacterium (b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, and b. longum), the dominant bacteria in human feces. first, eight new types of oligonucleotide probe were designed, complementary with the 16s rrna sequence specific to genus bifidobacterium and each bifidobacterial species described above. using whole cell hybridization, the fluorescent intensity was measured against the bacterial species targeted by each probe, to show that each probe is  specific to the targeted bacteria and that the relative fluorescent intensity (rfi) as an indicator of probe accessibility is high at 61-117%. then, bacterial  species-specific probes were labeled with fluorochromes (fitc, tamra and cy5) in  seven different ways, singly or in combination. using these probes, seven species of bifidobacterium were differentially stained in mixed samples of cultured bacteria and feces from adult volunteers, proving the efficacy of this technique.

TI  == enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  == thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by tpy agar and fish procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) cfu/g. three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. one child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia  using genus-specific fish probe. in bifidobacteria-positive samples, b. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by b. adolescentis (31.6%), b. bifidum (21.0%), b. breve (10.5%), b. pseudocatenulatum  (5.3%), and b. dentium (5.3%).

TI  == genus- and species-specific pcr primers for the detection and identification of bifidobacteria.
AB  == 16srdna-targeted genus- and species-specific pcr primers have been developed and  used for the identification and detection of bifidobacteria. these primers cover  all of the described species that inhabit the human gut, or occur in dairy products. identification of cultured bifidobacteria using pcr primer pairs is rapid and accurate, being based on nucleic acid sequences. detection of bifidobacteria can be achieved using dna extracted from human faeces as template  in pcr reactions. we have found that, in adult faeces, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most commonly detected species, followed by bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. in breastfed infants, bifidobacterium breve was the most frequently detected species, followed by bifidobacterium infantis, b. longum and b. bifidum. it was notable that the b. catenulatum group was detected with the highest frequency in adults, although it has often been reported that b. adolescentis is  the most common species. real-time, quantitative pcr using primers targeting 16s  rdna shows promise in the enumeration of bifidobacteria in faecal samples. the approach to detect the target bacteria with quantitative pcr described in this review will contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.

(bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.

TI  == basic features of the stress response in three species of bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. adolescentis, and b. breve.
AB  == the presence of the dnak heat shock gene could be demonstrated for b. longum ncc481, b. longum ncc490, b. longum ncc585, b. adolescentis ncc251, and b. breve  ncc298. induction of dnak on the transcriptional level was shown for ncc251 and ncc481 by increasing temperatures. ncc251 showed an additional chaperone-induction after salt or bile-salt treatment. in both strains preconditioning with bile-salts protected against otherwise lethal concentrations thereof. ncc251 when subjected to a heat stress was able to survive an otherwise  lethal temperature (55 degrees c). cross-protection was demonstrated for ncc251 since salt pretreatment resulted in increased tolerance after freeze-thawing cycles or lethal heat stress.

TI  == metabolization of beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides by different bifidobacteria.
AB  == low-molecular-mass beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides (beta-(2,6)-fos) were examined as a new carbohydrate source for growth of bifidobacteria. beta-(2,6)-fos were prepared from microbial high-molecular-mass levan by acid hydrolysis and refined by cation-exchange chromatography. (13)c-nmr spectroscopy  confirmed the presence of predominantly beta-(2,6)-fructosyl linkages in the oligosaccharides. more than 80% beta-(2,6)-fos was recovered after in vitro incubation with amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, implying resistance to degradation in the upper intestinal tract. bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. longum, b. breve, and b. pseudocatenulatum were studied in vitro for their ability to metabolize beta-(2,6)-fos. growth, decrease in ph, formation of short- chain fatty acids (lactate, acetate, formate) and degradation of beta-(2,6)-fos were markedly different among species. b. adolescentis showed the best growth, produced the highest amounts of organic acids and metabolized both short- and long-chain beta-(2, 6)-fos.

TI  == distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  == in order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific pcr technique was developed and used with dnas extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. to cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for bifidobacterium longum, b. infantis, b. dentium, and b. gallicum were developed and used with primers for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, and the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, r. tanaka, and h. oyaizu, fems microbiol. lett. 167:113-121, 1998). the specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by pcr, and the species-specific pcr method was found to be a useful means for identifying bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. the results of an examination  of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the b. catenulatum group was  the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by b. longum and b. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and  that b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. the present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.

TI  == rapid identification of human intestinal bifidobacteria by 16s rrna-targeted species- and group-specific primers.
AB  == on the basis of 16s rrna sequences, species- and group-specific primers for bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum), and the b. longum group (b. longum and b. infantis), which are species commonly found in human intestinal tracts, were developed. the specificity of these primers was confirmed through the use of dna extracted from 46 strains of 31 bifidobacterium species, as well as 14 non-bifidobacterial species that are the predominant bacteria in the human intestinal tract. the present species-specific primers were applied to  the identification of 43 isolated strains, consisting of six strains of b. adolescentis, eight of the b. catenulatum group, seven of b. bifidum, nine of b.  breve, and 13 of the b. longum group.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacteria by random dna amplification.
AB  == rapd conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat dna analysis and separate dna extractions. five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum. the use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the rapd method for  the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. the results indicated that  this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their rapd profiles. using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of bifidobacterium (b. breve, b. bifidum and b. adolescentis),  based on similarity of the rapd profiles to known reference strains. furthermore, application of the rapd technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either b. longum/infantis or b. animalis/lactis).

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == relationship between oxygen sensitivity and oxygen metabolism of bifidobacterium  species.
AB  == bifidobacteria, which are obligate anaerobes, were studied to determine the relationship between their sensitivity to oxygen and oxygen metabolism. among the four species tested, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium longum differed from bifidobacterium adolescentis in sensitivity  to oxygen. the former three species showed marked growth under conditions of partial aeration, whereas the growth of b. adolescentis was suppressed by low concentrations of oxygen. bifidobacteria express reduced nad-oxidase and -peroxidase activities, which function in a pathway for two-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide and, subsequently, water. activities of reduced nad-oxidase and -peroxidase were inversely correlated with  their sensitivities to oxygen. bifidobacterium adolescentis exhibited lowered activities of these two enzymes; the activities were 10 to 20% of those observed  with b. infantis, b. breve, and b. longum. these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that reduced nad-oxidase and reduced nad-peroxidase in bifidobacterium species play a role in prevention of oxygen toxicity. superoxide  dismutase activity was also detected in bifidobacterium species. superoxide dismutase is probably not involved in detoxification of oxygen, because the activity of this enzyme was extremely low, and the sensitivity to oxygen varied independently of superoxide dismutase activity.

AB  == portions of the 16s rrna from closely related species of the genus bifidobacterium that are found in the human intestinal microflora were sequenced  in order to design species-specific oligonucleotide probes. five oligonucleotide  probes ranging from 16 to 19 bases in length and complementary to 16s rrna sequences from bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were synthesized. with crude high-molecular-weight rna preparations as targets, these probes showed the desired species specificity, even down to a 1-nucleotide difference. for the practical evaluation of these probes, their specificity and sensitivity were tested against seven strains of the same species and 54 strains of heterologous bacteria with fixed whole cells as targets. the probes for b. adolescentis, b. breve, and b. longum showed efficient and specific hybridization. although the probes for b. bifidum and b. infantis cross-reacted with a few bacterial strains not isolated from humans, these probes showed species specificity for human intestinal bacteria. these 16s rrna probes should prove valuable for the identification and detection of human intestinal bifidobacterium species.
