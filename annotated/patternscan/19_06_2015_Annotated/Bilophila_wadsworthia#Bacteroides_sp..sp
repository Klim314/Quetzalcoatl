TI  == bilophila wadsworthia, gen. nov. and sp. nov., a unique gram-negative anaerobic rod recovered from appendicitis specimens and human faeces.
AB  == strongly catalase-positive gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from approximately half of all intra-abdominal specimens received from patients with gangrenous and perforated appendicitis, and subsequently also from normal faecal  specimens. the organism was originally detected on bacteroides-bile-aesculin (bbe) agar, and grew slowly on non-selective anaerobic media containing blood. it was stimulated by bile and differed from other known genera by being urease- and  catalase-positive, and by reducing nitrate. it did not reduce sulphate. other anaerobic gram-negative rods showed no homology by dna dot-blot hybridization. the thermal melting profile of chromosomal dna showed 39-40 mol% g + c. the whole-cell fatty acid methyl ester profile included cyclic and branched long-chain acids, and differed from those of all other anaerobes that have been tested. beta-lactamase was not detected. the name bilophila wadsworthia gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for this organism.
