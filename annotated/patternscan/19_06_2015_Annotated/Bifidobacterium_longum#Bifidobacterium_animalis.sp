TI  == oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. improves insulin resistance, induces  adiponectin, and prevents inflammatory adipokine expressions.
AB  == the intestinal microbiome might be an important contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. this study was designed to test the hypothesis that oral administration of bifidobacterium species (spp.) (including b. longum, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. animalis) may both ameliorate insulin resistance and reduce the expressions of inflammatory adipocytokines. male swiss-webster mice fed a high-fat diet with or without oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. for 5 weeks were subjected to an insulin tolerance test and an oral glucose tolerance test. plasma levels of glucose at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after insulin  injection or glucose administration were significantly lower in the bifidobacterium spp. than in the control group (p < 0.05), showing the beneficial effect of oral administration on insulin resistance in obese swiss mice. in addition, bifidobacterium spp. increased the adiponectin mrna level and decreased those of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 6 in non-diabetic c57bl/6j mice fed a normal diet, indicating a molecular mechanism which may ameliorate the inflammatory state, thereby reducing insulin resistance. in conclusion, oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. improves insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in obese mice by reducing inflammation, as it does in the lean state.

TI  == mupirocin-mucin agar for selective enumeration of bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a bacterial species exclusively found in the human intestinal tract. this species is becoming increasingly popular as a probiotic organism added to lyophilized products. in this study, porcine mucin was used as  the sole carbon source for the selective enumeration of b. bifidum in probiotic food additives. thirty-six bifidobacterial strains were cultivated in broth with  mucin. only 13 strains of b. bifidum utilized the mucin to produce acids. b. bifidum was selectively enumerated in eight probiotic food supplements using agar (mm agar) containing mupirocin (100 mg/l) and mucin (20 g/l) as the sole carbon source. mm agar was fully selective if the b. bifidum species was presented together with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, bifidobacterium breve, and  bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum species and with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli, streptococci). isolated strains of b. bifidum were identified using biochemical, pcr, maldi-tof procedures and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the novel selective medium was also suitable for the isolation of b. bifidum strains  from human fecal samples.

TI  == bifidobacteria supplementation: effects on plasma lipid profiles in dyslipidemic  children.
AB  == objective: preclinical investigations support the use of probiotics in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, but clinical evidence is often contrasting. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic formulation containing three bifidobacterium strains on lipid profiles in children affected by primary dyslipidemia. methods: thirty-eight children with dyslipidemia, ages 10.8 +/- 2.1 y, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. after a 4-wk diet run-in period, the children received probiotics (b. animalis subspecies lactis mb 2409, b. bifidum mb 109b, and b. longum subspecies longum bl04) or placebo for 3 mo. after 1 mo, wash-out treatments were switched. a strict dietary evaluation concerning satured fatty acids and cholesterol content, step i diet accordingly, was performed by a dietitian who examined the weekly dietary diary at each visit. results: baseline  lipid profile was (mean +/- sd): total cholesterol (tc) 222.8 +/- 23.2 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) 55.8 +/- 12.2 mg/dl, triglycerides (tg) 99.0 +/- 61.7 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) 147.2 +/- 21.9 mg/dl. after 3 mo of probiotic treatment, the lipid profile was: tc 211.9 +/- 27.3 mg/dl, hdl-c 60.7 +/- 14.2 mg/dl, tg 79.5 +/- 34.5 mg/dl, and ldl-c 135.3 +/- 24.2 mg/dl. compared with placebo, probiotics reduced tc by 3.4%  (p = 0.02) and ldl-c by 3.8% (p = 0.001). no significant dietary change occurred  through the study and no relevant adverse effects were observed. conclusions: treatment with a bifidobacterium probiotic formulation was well tolerated and useful in combination with to diet therapy. children with dyslipidemia benefited  from this approach, although the results need to be confirmed by larger controlled studies.

TI  == immune modulating capability of two exopolysaccharide-producing bifidobacterium strains in a wistar rat model.
AB  == fermented dairy products are the usual carriers for the delivery of probiotics to humans, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus being the most frequently used bacteria. in this work, the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 and bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 were tested for their capability to modulate immune response and the insulin-dependent glucose homeostasis using male wistar rats fed with a standard diet. three intervention groups were fed daily for 24 days with 10% skimmed milk, or with 10(9) cfu of the corresponding strain  suspended in the same vehicle. a significant increase of the suppressor-regulatory tgf- beta cytokine occurred with both strains in comparison with a control (no intervention) group of rats; the highest levels were reached in rats fed ipla r1. this strain presented an immune protective profile, as it was able to reduce the production of the proinflammatory il-6. moreover, phosphorylated akt kinase decreased in gastroctemius muscle of rats fed the strain ipla r1, without affecting the glucose, insulin, and homa index in blood,  or levels of glut-4 located in the membrane of muscle and adipose tissue cells. therefore, the strain b. animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 is a probiotic candidate  to be tested in mild grade inflammation animal models.

TI  == hydrolysis of milk gangliosides by infant-gut associated bifidobacteria determined by microfluidic chips and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
AB  == gangliosides are receiving considerable attention because they participate in diverse biological processes. milk gangliosides appear to block pathogen adhesion and modify the intestinal ecology of newborns. however, the interaction of milk gangliosides with gut bifidobacteria has been little investigated. the digestion  products of a mixture of gangliosides isolated from milk following incubation with six strains of bifidobacteria were studied using nanohplc chip q-tof ms. to  understand ganglioside catabolism in vitro, the two major milk gangliosides--gm3  and gd3--remaining in the media after incubation with bifidobacteria were quantified. individual gangliosides were identified through postprocessing precursor ion scans, and quantitated with the "find by molecular feature" algorithm of masshunter qualitative analysis software. bifidobacterium infantis and b. bifidum substantially degraded the gm3 and gd3, whereas b. longum subsp. longum and b. animalis subsp. lactis only showed moderate degradation. maldi fticr ms analysis enabled a deeper investigation of the degradation and identified ganglioside degradation specifically at the outer portions of the glycan molecules. these results indicate that certain infant gut-associated bifidobacteria have the ability to degrade milk gangliosides releasing sialic acid, and that these glycolipids could play a prebiotic role in the infant gut.

TI  == isomer-specific consumption of galactooligosaccharides by bifidobacterial species.
AB  == prebiotics are nondigestible substrates that stimulate the growth of beneficial microbes in the human intestine. galactooligosaccharides (gos) are food ingredients that possess prebiotic properties, in particular, promoting the growth of bifidobacteria in situ. however, precise mechanistic details of gos consumption by bifidobacteria remain poorly understood. because gos are mixtures  of polymers of different lengths and linkages, there is interest in determining which specific structures provide prebiotic effects to potentially create better  supplements. this paper presents a method comprising porous graphitic carbon separation, isotopic labeling, and mass spectrometry analysis for the structure-specific analysis of gos isomers and their bacterial consumption rate.  using this strategy, the differential bacterial consumption of gos by the bifidobacteria species bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and bifidobacterium adolescentis was determined, indicating that the use of specific gos isomers in infant formula may provide enrichment of distinct species.

TI  == the diversity of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in inner mongolia, china.
AB  == the mongolian nationality has developed their unique lifestyle and dietary habit  for thousands of years. however, by now, little research has been focused on mongolian gut microbiota and how it is related to different dietary habits. in this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methods were applied to reveal the diversity of  predominant gut bacteria of 48 healthy mongolians recruited from hohhot city and  the xilin gol pasturing area in inner mongolia. compared to similar studies of other nationalities, results from the present study have confirmed that the composition of mongolian gut microbiota is highly similar at the phylum level (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria) but variable at the genus level. especially, the numbers of phascolarctobacterium, lactobacillus  and bifidobacterium are rather high. dgge profiles of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium revealed that lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis were predominant in the gut of the mongolian subjects studied. on the contrary, lactobacillus helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the hohhot city mongolians. qpcr results revealed that the numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium of xilin gol mongolians were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of hohhot mongolians, whereas the numbers of enterobacterium were significantly lower (p<0.05). in addition, by partial least squares discriminate  analysis and cluster analysis of data generated from dgge and qpcr experiments, a striking difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota of mongolians living in hohhot city and the xilin gol pasturing area has been found. this study clearly shows that diet affects the microbiota composition of mongolians living in different circumstances, i.e. urban versus rural.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has become an important issue in clinics. this study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-blf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling mrsa infection. clinical mrsa strains were isolated from different patient specimens. apo-blf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-mrsa activity than complete blf in that it inhibited the growth of most mrsa strains tested in vitro. otherwise, the supernatants produced by lactobacillus fermentum (atcc 11739), bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (atcc 15707) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bcrc 17394) inhibited the growth of various mrsa strains. further, l. fermentum or b. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against mrsa strains. however, l. fermentum and not b. animalis subsp. lactis or b. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-lf and blf-hydrolysate. therefore, it is suggested that l. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against mrsa infections.

TI  == a comparison of two probiotic strains of bifidobacteria in premature infants.
AB  == objective: to determine the impact of 2 probiotic bifidobacteria on the fecal microbiota of premature infants fed either human milk or formula. study design: in the first of two phase 1 clinical trials, 12 premature infants receiving formula feedings were assigned randomly to receive either bifidobacterium longum  ssp infantis or bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis in increasing doses during a  5-week period. in the second, 9 premature infants receiving their mother's milk received each of the two bifidobacteria for 2 weeks separated by a 1-week washout period. serial stool specimens from each infant were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for bacterial composition. results: among the formula-fed infants, there was a greater increase in fecal bifidobacteria among infants receiving b infantis (binf) than those receiving b lactis (blac). this difference was most marked at a dose of 1.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units twice daily (p < .05). bacterial diversity improved over dose/time in those infants receiving binf. among the human milk-fed infants, greater increases in fecal bifidobacteria and decreases in gamma-proteobacteria followed the administration of binf than blac. the b longum group (which includes binf but not blac) was the dominant bifidobacteria among the human milk-fed infants, regardless of the probiotic administered. conclusions: binf was more effective at colonizing the fecal microbiota than blac in both formula-fed and human milk-fed premature infants. the combination of human milk plus binf resulted in the greatest fecal levels of bifidobacteria.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == rapid assay to assess colonization patterns following in-vivo probiotic ingestion.
AB  == background: colonization of the intestine with some microorganisms has been shown to have beneficial health effects. the association of bacteria with its human host starts soon after birth; however in infants born prematurely establishment of normal intestinal flora is interrupted with colonization with potential pathogenic organisms probiotic supplementation may therefore be beneficial to the health of preterm infants. as most probiotic organisms are difficult to culture,  confirmation of their colonization after supplementation is difficult. in this study, rapid qpcr assays for detection of presence of probiotic species in the intestine by faecal sampling is described in both preterm infant and adult participants. findings: probiotic colonization was determined using qpcr directed at amplification of organisms present in the ingested probiotic streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. infantis. overall, differential detection of probiotic strains in faeces were found between adult and preterm infants, with 50% of infants continuing to shed at least two probiotic strains three weeks after probiotic ingestion had ceased.  conclusions: this study demonstrated rapid assessment of the preterm infant gut for colonization with probiotic strains using real-time pcr. this method would be of great importance in studies of probiotics in prevention of diseases and adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  == factors influencing the stability of freeze-dried stress-resilient and stress-sensitive strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  == freeze-drying is a common method for preservation of probiotics, including bifidobacteria, for further industrial applications. however, the stability of freeze-dried bifidobacteria varies depending on the freeze-drying method and subsequent storage conditions. the primary goals of this study were to develop an optimized freeze-drying procedure and to determine the effects of temperature, water activity, and atmosphere on survival of freeze-dried bifidobacteria. to address these goals, a commercially used bifidobacteria strain that is resilient  to stress, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, and a characterized intestinal strain that is more sensitive to stress conditions, bifidobacterium longum djo10a, were used. a freeze-drying protocol was developed using trehalose  as the cryoprotectant, which resulted in almost no loss of viability during freeze-drying. resuscitation medium, temperature, and time did not significantly  influence recovery rates when this cryoprotectant was used. the effects of temperature (-80 to 45 degrees c), water activity (0.02 to 0.92), and atmosphere  (air, vacuum, and nitrogen) were evaluated for the stability of the freeze-dried  powders during storage. freeze-dried b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 was found to survive under all conditions tested, with optimum survival at temperatures up to  21 degrees c, water activities up to 0.44, and all 3 atmospheres tested. the intestinal-adapted strain b. longum djo10a was much more sensitive to the different storage conditions, but could be adequately maintained using optimum conditions. these optimum storage conditions included frozen storage, replacement of oxygen with nitrogen, and water activities between 0.11 and 0.22. these results indicated that an optimized storage environment is required to maintain viability of stress-sensitive bifidobacteria strains, whereas stress-resilient bifidobacteria strains can maintain viability over a wide range of storage conditions, which is practical in countries where controlled cold storage conditions may not be readily available.

TI  == in vitro growth of four individual human gut bacteria on oligosaccharides produced by chemoenzymatic synthesis.
AB  == the present study aimed at examining oligosaccharides (os) for potential stimulation of probiotic bacteria. nineteen structurally well-defined candidate os covering groups of beta-glucosides, alpha-glucosides and alpha-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). fourteen of the os are not naturally occurring and five (beta-d-glucosyl-fructose, beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-mannose, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-xylose; alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-l-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. these os have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 os to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, bacteroides vulgatus has  been evaluated in monocultures. the disaccharides beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol and beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of l. acidophilus ncfm, and additionally, beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated b. longum bl-05. alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-n-acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum bl-05, whereas l. acidophilus ncfm and bac. vulgatus  did not grow on these os. alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and l. acidophilus ncfm. thus several of the structurally well-defined os supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. this reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for os, including specificity for non-naturally occurring os, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == identification and characterization of whib-like family proteins of the bifidobacterium genus.
AB  == bifidobacteria are strictly anaerobic bacteria, that are an important component of human microbiote due to their probiotic characteristics. they are frequently exposed to a variety of stresses, therefore, identification of genes implicated in stress responses in bifidobacteria is critical for biomedicine and maintenance of industrial strains. the whib-like family proteins unique for actinobacteria are transcriptional regulators involved in major cellular processes, including stress responses. the aim of this study was the identification of whib-like family proteins of the bifidobacterium genus of the actinobacteria class and functional characterization of conservative whib-like genes. the dna sequence database of 36 strains revealed a family of whib-encoding genes. it were identified the wble orthologs in all bifidobacteria species and the whib2 orthologs in all bifidobacterial strains except of all strains of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and bifidobacterium gallicum. some strains, in particular, those of the bifidobacterium longum group, contain additional whib-like genes of  different length and a low degree of similarity in sequences. the wble and whib2  genes of the bifidobacterium genus are evolutionary conservative and ancient genes. the real-time pcr analysis showed that transcription of wble is induced by a variety of stress conditions such as heat shock, osmotic, oxidative stresses, by antibiotic tetracycline and bile salt treatment, the nutrient starvation and entry into late stationary phase. the wble gene may play a significant role in general stress responses in bifidobacteria.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == short communication: identification and differentiation of bifidobacteria obtained from ukraine.
AB  == ten freeze-dried bifidobacterial strains used as probiotics in ukrainian dairy foods, identified by the supplier as bifidobacterium adolescentis (2), bifidobacterium bifidum (2), bifidobacterium longum (4), bifidobacterium animalis (1), and bifidobacterium infantis (1), were characterized. following rehydration  and anaerobic growth on de man, rogosa, and sharpe-cysteine medium at 37 degrees  c for 72 h, single-colony isolates were picked and evaluated using pcr primers specific for the bifidobacterium genus, for the supplier-identified species, and  for b. animalis ssp. lactis. all isolates were identified as members of the genus bifidobacterium; however, species-specific pcr revealed all 10 isolates were actually strains of b. animalis ssp. lactis. further evaluation using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was only able to separate a single strain (rt 09) from the other 9 strains evaluated. application of genome-wide allelic profiling to the ukrainian bifidobacterial strains revealed 4 distinct groups. interestingly, 6 (60%) of the isolates fell into the same cluster as that containing the common commercial probiotic strain bb-12. two of the strains (rt 02 and rt 09) were found to be in the same group as atcc 27536 and one strain (rt 08) was in the same group as the rb 7239 (a previously evaluated commercial strain). one strain, rt 04, was placed on a unique branch. these results highlight the importance of employing routine typing of bifidobacterial isolates, demonstrate the utility of single nucleotide polymorphism/insertion-deletion polymorphism-based allelic typing in b. animalis ssp. lactis strain differentiation and further point to the limited genetic variability of b. animalis ssp. lactis strains and the worldwide distribution of a small number of  commercial strains.

AB  == background: cell surface pili in gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. so far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. results and discussion: in this report, atomic force microscopy (afm) of various  bifidobacterial strains belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fima or fimp) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as  fimb and/or fimq), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (stra). quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr analysis and rt-pcr experiments revealed a polycistronic mrna, encompassing the fima/p and fimb/q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

TI  == intrinsic and inducible resistance to hydrogen peroxide in bifidobacterium species.
AB  == interest in, and use of, bifidobacteria as a probiotic delivered in functional foods has increased dramatically in recent years. as a result of their anaerobic  nature, oxidative stress can pose a major challenge to maintaining viability of bifidobacteria during functional food storage. to better understand the oxidative stress response in two industrially important bifidobacteria species, we examined the response of three strains of b. longum and three strains of b. animalis subsp. lactis to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)). each strain was exposed to a range of h(2)o(2) concentrations (0-10 mm) to evaluate and compare intrinsic resistance to h(2)o(2). next, strains were tested for the presence of an inducible oxidative stress response by exposure to a sublethal h(2)o(2) concentration for 20 or 60 min followed by challenge at a lethal h(2)o(2) concentration. results showed b. longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697 had the highest level of intrinsic h(2)o(2) resistance of all strains tested and b. animalis subsp. lactis bl-04 had the highest resistance among b. lactis strains. inducible h(2)o(2) resistance was detected in four strains, b. longum ncc2705, b. longum d2957, b. lactis rh-1, and b. lactis bl-04. other strains showed either no difference or increased sensitivity to h(2)o(2) after induction treatments. these data indicate that intrinsic and inducible resistance to hydrogen peroxide is strain specific in b.  longum and b. lactis and suggest that for some strains, sublethal h(2)o(2) treatments might help increase cell resistance to oxidative damage during production and storage of probiotic-containing foods.

TI  == screening of species-specific lactic acid bacteria for veal calves multi-strain probiotic adjuncts.
AB  == the selection of promising specific species of lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic characteristics is of particular interest in producing multi  species-specific probiotic adjuncts in veal calves rearing. the aim of the present work was to select and evaluate in vitro the functional activity of lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacterium longum and bacillus coagulans strains isolated from veal calves in order to assess their potential use as multi species-specific probiotics for veal calves. for this purpose, bacterial strains  isolated from faeces collected from 40 healthy 50-day-calves, were identified by  riboprinter and 16s rrna gene sequence. the most frequent strains belonged to the species b. longum, streptococcus bovis, lactobacillus animalis and streptococcus  macedonicus. among these, 7 strains were chosen for testing their probiotic characteristics in vitro. three strains, namely l. animalis sb310, lactobacillus  paracasei subsp. paracasei sb137 and b. coagulans sb117 showed varying individual but promising capabilities to survive in the gastrointestinal tract, to adhere, to produce antimicrobial compounds. these three selected species-specific bacteria demonstrated in vitro, both singularly and mixed, the functional properties needed for their use as potential probiotics in veal calves.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == adhesion of bile-adapted bifidobacterium strains to the ht29-mtx cell line is modified after sequential gastrointestinal challenge simulated in vitro using human gastric and duodenal juices.
AB  == according to the fao/who, in vitro criteria for selection of probiotics for food  application consist of testing survival when confronted with gastrointestinal tract (git) challenge and the ability to colonize the colon. we used a model that simulated git transit using sequential immersion in gastric and duodenal juices of human origin to evaluate survival of bile-adapted bifidobacterium strains. bifidobacterium animalis tolerated gastric juice, whereas bifidobacterium longum  showed poor survival under these conditions. in contrast, b. animalis strains were more sensitive to duodenal juice than b. longum. the percentage of survival  after git transit simulation (gitts), determined both by plate counts and fluorescent probes, was significantly higher for bile-adapted strains than for corresponding parental ones. this suggests that use of bile-adapted strains is a  suitable approach for increasing survival of bifidobacteria under the harsh conditions of the upper git. however, the bile resistance phenotype was not related to improvement of adhesion capacity, after gitts, of the intestinal cell  line ht29-mtx which constitutively produces mucus. this work shows that sequential gitts with human juices modified the in vitro adhesion properties of the strains challenged with colonocyte-like cells.

TI  == comparative analysis of an intestinal strain of bifidobacterium longum and a strain of bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis in cheddar cheese.
AB  == bifidobacteria cultures were incorporated into cheddar cheeses to conduct a comparative analysis between the commercially available strain bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 and the wild-type intestinal isolate, bifidobacterium  longum djo10a. they were incorporated as starter adjuncts in separate vats and as a mixed culture, and survival through manufacturing and cheese ripening was assessed. for cheese using only bb-12, the cells may have grown during cheese manufacture as 133% of the inoculum was incorporated into the cheese, resulting in 8.00 log cfu/g. counts remained high during ripening showing less than 1 log decrease over a 12-mo period. for cheese using a mixed culture of bb-12 and djo10a, both strains were incorporated at much lower levels: 3.02 and 1.11%, respectively. this resulted in cheese with 6.00 and 5.04 log cfu/g for bb-12 and  djo10a, respectively. bifidobacteria survival rates were low, most likely due to  the moisture of the cheese being below 38%. the bb-12 demonstrated almost 100% viability during ripening. numbers of djo10a started to decline after 2 mo of ripening and dropped below the level of detection (2 log cfu/g) after 4.5 mo of ripening. neither djo10a nor bb-12 fortified cheeses produced detectable amounts  of organic acids during ripening other than lactic acid, indicating the lack of detectable metabolic contribution from bifidobacteria during cheese production and ripening such as production of acetic acid. to determine if sublethal stresses could improve the viability of djo10a, 2 more vats were made, 1 with djo10a exposed to sublethal acid, cold, and centrifugation stresses, and 1 exposed to none of these stresses. although stress-primed djo10a survived cheese  manufacture better, as 72.8% were incorporated into the cheese compared with 41.1% of the unprimed, the statistical significance of this difference is unknown. in addition, the difference in moisture levels in the cheese cannot be excluded as influencing this difference. however, the rate of decline during ripening was similar for both. after 6 mo of ripening, cell counts in cheese were 4.68 and 4.24 log cfu/g for primed and unprimed cultures, respectively. these results suggest that whereas priming bifidobacteria with sublethal stresses before incorporation in a cheese fermentation may improve the number of viable cells that get incorporated into the cheese, it does not affect viability during  cheese ripening.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == safety and intestinal microbiota modulation by the exopolysaccharide-producing strains bifidobacterium animalis ipla r1 and bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 orally administered to wistar rats.
AB  == bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 and bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 strains were tested for their safety and ability to modulate the intestinal microbiota in vivo. chemically simulated gastrointestinal digestion showed considerably lower survival of e44 than r1 strain, the first microorganism also being more sensitive to refrigerated storage in 10% skimmed milk at 4 degrees c.  harmful glycosidic activities were absent, or at low levels, in the strains r1 and e44. both strains were sensitive to most antibiotics and resistant to aminoglycosides, a common feature in bifidobacteria. similar to several other bifidobacteria strains, b. animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 displayed a moderate resistance against tetracycline which correlated with the presence of tet(w) gene in its genome. the general parameters indicating well-being status, as well as translocation to different organs and histological examination of the gut tissues, revealed no changes induced by the administration of bifidobacteria to rats. twelve-week-old male wistar rats were distributed into three groups, eight  rats in each. two groups were administered daily over 10(8)cfu of the corresponding strain suspended in 10% skimmed milk for 24 days, whereas rats in the placebo group received skimmed milk without microorganisms added. the microbiota and short chain fatty acids (scfa) were monitored in faeces at different time points during treatment and in caecum content at the end of the assay. quantitative pcr (qpcr) showed that faecal and caecal bifidobacterium levels were higher in bifidobacteria-fed rats than in the placebo rats at the end of the intervention, whereas total anaerobic plate counts did not show significant differences. quantification of b. animalis and b. longum by qpcr showed that, independent of the microorganism administered, treatment with bifidobacteria resulted in higher levels of b. animalis in the caecum. pcr-dgge analysis of microbial populations revealed a higher diversity of bands in caecum  content of rats fed b. animalis ipla r1 than in the placebo group and rats fed b. longum ipla e44. remarkably, although no variations in the proportion of acetate, propionate and butyrate were found, at the end of the assay the total scfa concentration in the faeces of rats fed bifidobacteria was significantly higher and those in caecum content significantly lower, than that of the placebo group.  this suggests a displacement of the scfa production to parts of the colon beyond  the caecum in rats receiving bifidobacteria. therefore, the oral administration of b. animalis ipla r1 and b. longum e44 can be considered safe, these microorganisms having the ability to modulate the intestinal microbiota of rats by influencing scfa and the bifidobacterial population levels.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains abrogate in vitro the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins on eukaryotic cells.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the capability of the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from human and dairy origin to antagonize the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins. methods and results: the cytotoxicity of bacillus cereus extracellular factors on caco-2 colonocytes in the presence/absence of the eps was determined by measuring the integrity of the tissue monolayer and the damage to the cell membrane (extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity). additionally, the protective effect of eps against the haemolytic activity of the streptolysin-o was evaluated on rabbit erythrocytes. the eps produced by bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis a1 and ipla-r1, bifidobacterium longum nb667 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were able to counteract the toxic effect of bacterial toxins on the eukaryotic cells at 1mg ml(-1) eps concentration. the eps a1 was the most effective in counteracting the  effect of b. cereus toxins on colonocytes, even at lower doses (0.5mg ml(-1) ), whereas eps nb667 elicited the highest haemolysis reduction on erythrocytes. conclusions: the production of eps by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could antagonize the toxicity of bacterial pathogens, this effect being eps and biological marker dependent. significance and impact of the study: this work allows gaining insight about the mechanisms that probiotics could exert to improve the host health.

TI  == genomic insights into bifidobacteria.
AB  == since the discovery in 1899 of bifidobacteria as numerically dominant microbes in the feces of breast-fed infants, there have been numerous studies addressing their role in modulating gut microflora as well as their other potential health benefits. because of this, they are frequently incorporated into foods as probiotic cultures. an understanding of their full interactions with intestinal microbes and the host is needed to scientifically validate any health benefits they may afford. recently, the genome sequences of nine strains representing four species of bifidobacterium became available. a comparative genome analysis of these genomes reveals a likely efficient capacity to adapt to their habitats, with b. longum subsp. infantis exhibiting more genomic potential to utilize human milk oligosaccharides, consistent with its habitat in the infant gut. conversely, b. longum subsp. longum exhibits a higher genomic potential for utilization of plant-derived complex carbohydrates and polyols, consistent with its habitat in an adult gut. an intriguing observation is the loss of much of this genome potential when strains are adapted to pure culture environments, as highlighted by the genomes of b. animalis subsp. lactis strains, which exhibit the least potential for a gut habitat and are believed to have evolved from the b. animalis species during adaptation to dairy fermentation environments.

TI  == distinct bifidobacterium strains drive different immune responses in vitro.
AB  == in this work we evaluated the specific immune activation properties of different  bifidobacterium strains, some of the most relevant intestinal microorganisms. to  this end, we examined the in vitro effect of 12 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 4 different species, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, on the maturation pattern of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs), as well as in their ability to induce cytokine secretion. in addition, we determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation and cytokine expression after exposure to bacterial strains. all bifidobacteria tested were able to induce full dc maturation but showed differences in the levels of cytokine production, especially il-12, il-10, tnfalpha and il-1beta, suggesting that specific cytokine ratios could be used to predict the type of th response that they may promote. in fact, analysis of cytokine production by pbmc showed that most of the tested b. animalis and b. longum strains induced the secretion of large amounts of ifngamma and tnfalpha, in agreement with the th1 profile suggested by dc cytokine production. remarkably, three of four b. bifidum strains induced poor secretion of these cytokines and significant amounts of il-17, the main product of th17 cells, in accordance with the high il-1beta/il-12 ratio observed after dc stimulation. in conclusion, this work shows species and strain-specific immune effects of bifidobacteria and describes a valuable method for screening possible  probiotic strains with different immunomodulatory properties. notably, some b. bifidum strains seem to promote th17 polarization, which could be useful for future probiotic applications.

TI  == species delineation and clonal diversity in four bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.
AB  == the genus bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the gut microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. we sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 bifidobacterium strains of  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that b. longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within b. longum subsp. longum. clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate leaky species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in b. bifidum, b. breve and b. longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies. frequent homologous recombination accelerates clonal diversification and may facilitate the transfer of biological  properties among bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == bifidobacteria inhibit the inflammatory response induced by gliadins in intestinal epithelial cells via modifications of toxic peptide generation during  digestion.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is a chronic enteropathy triggered by intake of gliadin, the  toxic component of gluten. this study aims at evaluating the capacity of different bifidobacterium strains to counteract the inflammatory effects of gliadin-derived peptides in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells. a commercial extract of several gliadin (gld) types (alpha, beta, gamma, [symbol: see text] )  was subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin at ph 3, pancreatin-bile at ph 6), inoculated or not with cell suspensions (10(8) colony forming units/ml) of either b. animalis iata-a2, b. longum iata-es1, or b. bifidum iata-es2, in a bicameral system. the generated gliadin-derived peptides were identified by reverse phase-hplc-esi-ms/ms. caco-2 cell cultures were exposed to the different gliadin peptide digestions (0.25 mg protein/ml), and the mrna expression of nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-kappab), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and chemokine cxcr3 receptor were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in stimulated cells. the production of the pro-inflammatory markers nf-kappab p50, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta (interleukine 1beta) by caco-2 cells was also determined  by elisa. the peptides from gliadin digestions inoculated with bifidobacteria did not exhibit the toxic amino acid sequences identified in those noninoculated (alpha/beta-gld [158-164] and alpha/beta-gld [122-141]). the rt-pcr analysis evidenced a down-regulation in mrna expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. consistent with these results the production of nf-kappab, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta was reduced (18.2-22.4%, 28.0-64.8%, and abolished, respectively) in cell cultures exposed to gliadin digestions inoculated with bifidobacteria. therefore, bifidobacteria change the gliadin-derived peptide pattern and, thereby, attenuate their pro-inflammatory effects on caco-2 cells.

AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacterium longum ipla e44 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1 modify the composition and metabolic activity of human faecal microbiota in ph-controlled batch cultures.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from two bifidobacterium strains, one of human  intestinal origin (bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum ipla e44) and the other from dairy origin (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis ipla r1), were subjected to in vitro chemically simulated gastrointestinal digestion, which showed the absence of degradation of both polymers in these conditions. polymers  were then used as carbon sources in ph-controlled faecal batch cultures and compared with the non-prebiotic carbohydrate glucose and the prebiotic inulin to  determine changes in the composition of faecal bacteria. a set of eight fluorescent in situ hybridisation oligonucleotide probes targeting 16s rrna sequences was used to quantify specific groups of microorganisms. growth of the opportunistic pathogen clostridium histolyticum occurred with all carbohydrates tested similarly to that found in negative control cultures without added carbohydrate and was mainly attributed to the culture conditions used rather than enhancement of growth by these substrates. polymers e44 and r1 stimulated growth  of lactobacillus/enterococcus, bifidobacterium, and bacteroides/prevotella in a similar way to that seen with inulin. the eps r1 also promoted growth of the atopobium cluster during the first 24h of fermentation. an increase in acetic and lactic acids was found during early stages of fermentation (first 10-24h) correlating with increases of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and atopobium. propionic acid concentrations increased in old cultures, which was coincident with the enrichment of clostridium cluster ix in cultures with eps r1 and with the increases in bacteroides in cultures with both microbial eps (r1 and e44) and inulin. the lowest acetic to propionic acid ratio was obtained for eps e44. none  of the carbohydrates tested supported the growth of microorganisms from clostridium clusters xiva+b and iv, results that correlate with the poor butyrate production in the presence of eps. thus, eps synthesized by bifidobacteria from dairy and intestinal origins can modulate the intestinal microbiota in vitro, promoting changes in some numerically and metabolically relevant microbial populations and shifts in the production of short chain fatty acids.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == [screening and identification of probiotic bifidobacterium from mongolian children].
AB  == objective: bifidobacterium has important physiological activity in gastrointestinal tract of human and animals, and the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt are the key factors that influence the function of living bacteria preparation. in this study, feces of 12 healthy mongolian children were selected to isolate bifidobacterium with probiotic properties. methods: bifidobacterium was isolated from feces by selective medium  and identified by physiological biochemical test. the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt of 11 bfidobacteria were studied and b. animalis v9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16s rdna. results: eleven bifidobacteria isolated from feces of 12 healthy mongolian children were identified as b. adolescentis (a1, h3, g4, a8 and v10), b. longum (c6, c7 and d11), b. pseudocatenlatum (b2), b. bifidum (g5), b. animalis (v9). b. animalis v9 had the best acid tolerance with the survival rate 92.4% in artificial gastric juice at ph2.0 for 3h, whereas others had lower than 31.25%. b. animalis v9 also had good survival rate (99.7%) in artificial intestinal juice at ph8.0 for 8h after anaerobic cultured 3h in artificial gastric juice at ph2.0, and tolerated oxgall bile salt at concentration of 0.3%. b. animalis v9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16s rdna and result showed the homologies of b. animalis v9 was 99% with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactic bb12. conclusion: b. animalis v9 had good probiotic properties to be potentiallyused in dairy products and health products.

TI  == evaluation of the passage of lactobacillus gasseri k7 and bifidobacteria from the stomach to intestines using a single reactor model.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines. recently, a novel approach to simulate the passage from stomach to intestines in a single bioreactor was developed. the advantage of this automated  one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and  pancreatin.lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a strain isolated from infant faeces with  properties making the strain interesting for cheese production. in this study, a  single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k7 and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage. results: initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage. similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp. infantis whereas b. animalis subsp. lactis had a high survival.these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage. b. animalis subsp. lactis had the highest survival rate (10%) attaining approximately 5 x 106 cfu ml-1 compared to the other tested  bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to 106. lactobacillus gasseri k7 was less resistant than b. animalis subsp. lactis but survived at cell concentrations approximately 1000 times higher than other bifidobacteria. conclusion: in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k7 had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage. by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation. of  the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp. lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.

TI  == bile-inducible efflux transporter from bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, conferring bile resistance.
AB  == bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human gut. some strains of this genus are considered health promoting or probiotic, being included in numerous food products. in order to exert their health benefits, these bacteria must overcome biological barriers, including bile salts, to colonize and survive in specific parts of the intestinal tract. the role of multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters in bile resistance of probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile on probiotic gene expression are not fully understood. in the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of bile on the expression levels of predicted mdr genes from three different bifidobacterial strains, belonging to bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis, was tested. in this way, two putative mdr genes whose expression was induced by bile, bl0920 from b. longum and its homolog, bbr0838, from b. breve, were identified. the expression of the bl0920 gene in escherichia  coli was shown to confer resistance to bile, likely to be mediated by active efflux from the cells. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identified bifidobacterial bile efflux pump whose expression is induced by bile.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == a bifidobacterium mixed-species microarray for high resolution discrimination between intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == a genomic dna-based microarray was constructed containing over 6000 randomly cloned genomic fragments of approximately 1-2 kb from six mammalian intestinal bifidobacterium spp. including b. adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, b. longum and b. pseudolongum. this bifidobacterium mixed-species (bms) microarray was used to differentiate between type strains and isolates belonging to a set of nine bifidobacterium spp. hierarchical clustering of genomic hybridization data confirmed the grouping of the bifidobacterium spp. according to the 16s rrna-based phylogenetic clusters. in addition, these genomic hybridization experiments revealed high homology between the type-strain b. animalis subsp. lactis lmg18314 and b. animalis subsp. animalis lmg10508 (79%) as well as between the type strains b. longum biotype longum lmg13197 and b. longum  biotype infantis lmg8811 (72%) - nevertheless, discrimination between these species was possible due to the high resolution output of the bms-array. in addition, it was shown that the bms-array could be used for assigning unknown bifidobacterium isolates to a species group. finally, a set of 54 diagnostic clones for bifidobacterium identification was selected and sequenced to advance the understanding of the species-related differences. remarkably, a large fraction (31%) of these was predicted to encode proteins that belong to the bifidobacterial glycobiome and another 11% had functional homology with genes involved in the protection against foreign dna. overall, the bms-microarray is a  high-resolution diagnostic tool that is able to facilitate the detection of strain- and species-specific characteristics of bifidobacteria.

TI  == detection of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  == a real-time pcr method has been developed to distinguish bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain bb12) from bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, several species of lactobacillus, and enterococcus faecium. real-time pcr detection of serially diluted dna extracted from a pure culture of bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per pcr (r(2) = 0.99). relative differences in bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with bb12 were determined after detection of bb12 tuf gene copies in dna extracted from the intestinal contents. piglets treated with bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of bb12. piglets born to bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with bb12 at birth (t/t group) had a higher number of bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (c/c group), bb12-treated sows (t/c group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with bb12 immediately after birth (c/t group). in addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) in piglets from the t/t group, with no change in tlr2 and tlr4. these findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.

TI  == analysis of tetracycline resistance tet(w) genes and their flanking sequences in  intestinal bifidobacterium species.
AB  == objectives: the tet(w) gene provides tetracycline resistance to a wide range of anaerobic intestinal and ruminal bacteria, but little is known about the molecular organization of the tet(w) gene. the aim of this study was to gain new  insights into the molecular organization of the tet(w) gene in bifidobacteria strains from humans. methods: a segment of dna encompassing the whole tet(w) gene and its immediate upstream and downstream sequences was analysed in 10 representative strains of four bifidobacterium species, of which two have been shown to be tetracycline-susceptible. the non-conserved flanking regions of the tet(w) gene were further analysed in six strains. results: all 10 strains share a core dna domain of 2154 bp [starting 250 bp upstream of the tet(w) gene start codon and ending 13 bp before the stop codon] with 98% to 100% dna identity. except for bifidobacterium animalis e43, all other strains further share 408 bp upstream and 70 bp downstream of the tet(w) gene. an insertion-like element of 736 bp was found to interrupt the tet(w) coding sequence in bifidobacterium longum m21, which may be the reason for its tetracycline susceptibility. however, genetic events explaining the susceptible phenotype of b. longum lmg 13197(t) were not observed. conclusions: the tet(w) genes from all 10 strains shared 98% to 100% dna and amino acid identity, though large variation was found in their flanking regions.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == degradation of 16s rrna and attributes of viability of viable but nonculturable probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: to assess the stability of 16s rrna of viable but nonculturable (vbnc) probiotics during storage when compared with different attributes of viability. methods and results: levels of rna of the probiotic strains bifidobacterium longum 46, b. longum 2c and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 were monitored during storage in fermented and nonfermented foods. cells which gradually lost their culturability in fermented products retained high level of rrna, whereas rrna of  acid-killed control cells decreased at faster rate. furthermore, the viability of b. longum 2c was monitored during storage by measuring changes in reductase activity, cytoplasmic membrane integrity and esterase activity using a flow cytometer. all of the culture-independent viability assays suggested that the cells remained viable during storage. in nonfermented media, the observed losses  in culturability were smaller, and the changes in cell counts were comparable with the changes in rrna levels. conclusions: viable but nonculturable probiotics maintain high levels of rrna and retain properties of viable bacteria including reductase activity. quantification of 16s rrna complements culture-independent viability assays. significance and impact of the study: culture-independent viability assays allow the detection of vbnc probiotics, and can be used parallel to conventional culture-dependent methods to obtain accurate information on probiotic viability.

TI  == effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces  as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

TI  == safety assessment of dairy microorganisms: propionibacterium and bifidobacterium.
AB  == the genera propionibacterium and bifidobacterium are clustered in the class actinobacteria and form the anaerobic branch of coryneform bacteria. the dairy propionibacteria comprising four species p. freudenreichii, p. acidipropionici, p. jensenii and p. thoenii are industrially important as starter cultures in hard-cheese ripening and recently also as protective bio-preservatives and probiotics. these four species are considered as safe whereas cutaneous propionibacterium species (also named "acnes group") are pathogens. in contrast,  bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products and milk powder are exclusively used as probiotics; selected strains of several species (out of more than thirty) contribute to this task. it has been only rarely found that commensal bifidobacteria have been connected with certain dental and other infections. consequently, only one single species, bifidobacterium dentium, is recognized as  pathogenic. genome sequence analysis of bifidobacterium longum and molecular biological analysis of other probiotic strains confirmed so far the absence of virulence and pathogenecity factors. however, tetracycline resistance genes tet(w), although probably not easy transferable, were found in bifidobacterium strains, also in bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, the worldwide most used  industrial strain. conclusively, strains from the propionibacterium and bifidobacterium species in dairy food generally represent so far no health hazards.

AB  == objective: to study the effects of probiotics and yoghurt supplementation on colonic microflora in subjects with lactose intolerance (li). methods: eleven lactose intolerant volunteers determined by 25g lactose challenge test were recruited and given supplementation with bifina capsule (with b. longum) and yogurt (with b. animalis, l. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus) for 14 days. the trial  was divided into 3 phases: 7-day basal period, 14-day supplementation period and  7-day post-supplementation period. two lactose challenge tests were performed 1 day before and 1 day after supplementation period respectively, and lactose intolerance symptoms were recorded with questionnaires. five fecal samples were collected during the trial, and total bacteria and several main groups of bacteria in colon were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). the shift of bifidobacterium species population in colon was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: it was found that li symptom was alleviated significantly after supplementation (p < 0.05). the amount of total bacteria and the main groups of bacteria (bifidobacteria, bacteroides-prevotella, eubacteria, ruminccocc, et al.) was significantly increased during the supplementation period (p < 0.05). the amount of bifidobacteria during post-supplementation period was significantly higher than that of basal period (p < 0.05), while the amount of other several groups of bacteria decreased. the result of dgge showed that the extraneous bifidobacteria species from bifina capsule and yoghurt could be detected in fecal samples during supplementation period, however there was diversity between volunteers. conclusion: it was suggested that extraneous bifidobacteria in bifina capsule and yogurt could resist the effect of gastric acid and bile salt, and survive in colon. supplementation of probiotics and yogurt could influence the colonic bacteria, and increase the number of main groups of colonic microflora, especially for bifidobacteria, which could play important role in alleviating li symptoms.

TI  == screening for plasmids among human bifidobacteria species: sequencing and analysis of pbc1 from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48.
AB  == analysis of 72 bifidobacterial isolates for plasmid dna identified six different  plasmid profiles, two profiles consisted of a single plasmid and four contained at least two. a plasmid identified in a bifidobacterium catenulatum strain (pbc1) was chosen for further characterization based on its small size and stability. the plasmid was shown to be a circular molecule of 2540 base pairs with an overall g+c content of 64%. at the putative origin of replication a direct repeat of 24 nucleotides repeated three and a half times was observed, as well as five inverted repeats, which resembled the organization of theta-type replicating plasmids. three open reading frames encoding peptides larger than 50 amino acids  were also identified: repb, encoding a replicase of 315 amino acids, a transcriptionally coupled gene (orfx-like), similar to the orfx of some theta-replicating lactococcal plasmids, and copg-like in the complementary strand, which showed a conserved domain present in proteins of the copg family. comparison of the deduced repb protein of pbc1 to other replication proteins in databases, identified pmb1 from bifidobacterium longum as its closest relative (81% amino acid identity). the pbc1 replicon proved to be functional in several bifidobacterium species, including b. animalis, b. longum, and b. pseudocatenulatum. hybridization experiments showed the replicon was uncommon among bifidobacteria. the relative copy number of pbc1 was estimated to be 30.9+/-4.62 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == bifidobacteria identification based on 16s rrna and pyruvate kinase partial gene  sequence analysis.
AB  == the lack of a simple and rapid identification system for bifidobacterium species  makes them difficult to use in industrial applications. to obtain valuable discriminating factor, we studied different strains, and human isolates by two molecular taxonomy methods. first method was based on chrono-differentiation. a metabolic gene (pyruvate kinase) was chosen to be used as a systematic discriminating factor. a comparison of about 40 pyruvate kinase protein sequences allowed us to synthesize two oligonucleotides that were able to amplify a fragment of this corresponding gene in our strains. based on these partial pyruvate kinase gene sequences, several clusters could be identified. the second  method used in this study was based on 16s rrna sequences analysis. we compared sequences present in genbank database, and this allowed to separate bifidobacteria species into different clusters. they were different from those obtained with partial pyruvate kinase gene sequences analysis. so, by combining both methods, we were able to identify our isolates, when only 10% of them could  be strictly identified using the 16s rrna method. moreover, pyruvate kinase analysis allowed to differentiate very ambivalent groups such as b. animalis/b. lactis or b. infantis/b. longum, but created different clusters for b. infantis species group, questioning on the homogeneity of this species.

TI  == kinetic analysis of bifidobacterial metabolism reveals a minor role for succinic  acid in the regeneration of nad+ through its growth-associated production.
AB  == several strains belonging to the genus bifidobacterium were tested to determine their abilities to produce succinic acid. bifidobacterium longum strain bb536 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain bb 12 were kinetically analyzed in  detail using in vitro fermentations to obtain more insight into the metabolism and production of succinic acid by bifidobacteria. changes in end product formation in strains of bifidobacterium could be related to the specific rate of  sugar consumption. when the specific sugar consumption rate increased, relatively more lactic acid and less acetic acid, formic acid, and ethanol were produced, and vice versa. all bifidobacterium strains tested produced small amounts of succinic acid; the concentrations were not more than a few millimolar. succinic acid production was found to be associated with growth and stopped when the energy source was depleted. the production of succinic acid contributed to regeneration of a small part of the nad+, in addition to the regeneration through the production of lactic acid and ethanol.

TI  == determination of survival, identity and stress resistance of probiotic bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts.
AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

TI  == characterization of the genus bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == enzymatic ability of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis to hydrolyze milk proteins: identification and characterization of endopeptidase o.
AB  == the proteolytic system of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis was analyzed, and an intracellular endopeptidase (pepo) was identified and characterized. this  work reports the first complete cloning, purification, and characterization of a  proteolytic enzyme in bifidobacterium spp. aminopeptidase activities (general aminopeptidases, proline iminopeptidase, x-prolyl dipeptidylaminopeptidase) found in cell extracts of b. animalis subsp. lactis were higher for cells that had been grown in a milk-based medium than for those grown in mrs. a high specific proline iminopeptidase activity was observed in b. animalis subsp. lactis. whole cells and cell wall-bound protein fractions showed no caseinolytic activity; however, the combined action of intracellular proteolytic enzymes could hydrolyze casein fractions rapidly. the endopeptidase activity of b. animalis subsp. lactis was examined in more detail, and the gene encoding an endopeptidase o in b. animalis  subsp. lactis was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence for b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo indicated that it is a member of the m13 peptidase family of zinc metallopeptidases and displays 67.4% sequence homology with the predicted pepo protein from bifidobacterium longum. the recombinant enzyme was shown to be a 74-kda monomer. activity of b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo was found with oligopeptide substrates of at least 5 amino acid residues, such as met-enkephalin, and with larger substrates, such as the 23-amino-acid peptide alpha s1-casein(f1-23). the predominant peptide bond cleaved by b. animalis subsp. lactis pepo was on the n-terminal side of phenylalanine residues. the enzyme also showed a post-proline secondary cleavage  site.

TI  == acquisition of bile salt resistance promotes antibiotic susceptibility changes in bifidobacterium.
AB  == the effect of acquired resistance to bile on the antimicrobial sensitivity of two bifidobacterium strains (bifidobacterium animalis ipla4549 and bifidobacterium longum nizo b667) was studied. the mics of 23 different antibiotics belonging to  the most clinically important groups were determined by using the etest method, which comprises nonporous plastic strips calibrated with a predefined gradient of antibiotic concentrations covering 15 twofold dilutions. the strains were sensitive to most antibiotics assayed, although they tolerated relatively high concentrations of gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, polymyxin b, and ciprofloxacin (from 32 to more than 1,024 microg/ml). one of the bile-adapted strains was more strongly resistant to ceftazidime than was its parent bile-sensitive strain, and the other bile-adapted strain had increased resistance to tetracyclines. therefore, to test the possibility that the acquisition of stable resistance to bile could be associated with a general increase in resistance to some antibiotics, we analyzed the sensitivities of four additional  pairs of parent strains and their bile-adapted derivatives to ceftazidime and three tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, and tetracycline). three of the bile-resistant derivatives had increased resistance to ceftazidime (more than 256-fold) compared with their parents, and two had enhanced resistance to tetracyclines (at least 12-fold). thus, the acquisition of bile salts resistance  in bifidobacterium induced modifications of the antibiotic resistance patterns. these results suggest that adaptation of probiotics to bile could also change their potential impact on intestinal microbiota, and this possibility deserves further attention.

AB  == a total of 58 probiotic products obtained worldwide, which were claimed to contain bifidobacterium strains (including 22 yoghurts, 5 dairy fruit drinks, 28  food supplements and 3 pharmaceutical preparations) were investigated in parallel using a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. three isolation media previously reported as selective for bifidobacterium were evaluated for their suitability in the quality analysis of these products. subsequently, possible bifidobacterial colonies were picked from the best medium and identified by means of rep-pcr fingerprinting using the box primer (box-pcr). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, formerly classified as bifidobacterium lactis, was most frequently found, but strains belonging to bifidobacterium longum biotypes longum and infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium  breve were recovered also. in parallel, all products were also subjected to culture-independent analysis which involved a nested-pcr step on total bacterial  dna extracted directly from the product, followed by separation of the amplicons  by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and subsequent identification of species from the band patterns. by conventional cultivation, 70.7% of the products analysed were found to contain culturable bifidobacteria whereas by culture-independent dgge analysis members of the genus bifidobacterium could be detected in 96.5% of the analysed products. genotypic characterization of a number of bifidobacterial isolates at the strain level by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a relatively high degree of genomic homogeneity among the bifidobacterium strains currently used in the probiotic industry.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of a plasmid, pkj50, isolated from an intestinal bacterium, bifidobacterium longum kj, has been determined. the plasmid was analysed and found to be 4960 bp in size with a g+c content of 61.7 mol%. computer analysis of sequence data revealed three major orfs encoding putative proteins of 31.5 (orfi), 24.5 (orfii) and 38.6 kda (orfiii). orfi encodes a protein with a pi of 10.18 and shows relatively high amino acid sequence similarity (more than 60%) with several plasmid replication proteins from gram-positive and -negative bacteria. southern blot analysis showed that pkj50 accumulates an ssdna intermediate, suggesting that it replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism. upstream of orfi, three sets of repeated sequences resembling iteron structures of related plasmids were identified. orfiii encodes  a protein with a pi of 10.97. it also shows a high level of amino acid sequence similarity with some plasmid mobilization proteins. upstream of orfiii, a 12 bp stretch resembles an orit dna sequence with inverted repeats identical to those found in conjugative plasmids. hydropathy plot analysis of orfii, encoding an acidic protein (pi = 4.95), suggests it is a transmembrane protein. several interesting palindromic sequences, repeat sequences and hairpin-loop structures around orfi, which might confer regulatory effects on the replication of the plasmid, were also noted. reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) and in vitro translation confirmed the expression of orfi and orfii. rt-pcr produced amplified dna fragments of the expected sizes, corresponding to orfi and orfii. however, no rt-pcr product corresponding to orfiii was obtained. in vitro translation showed  protein bands of the expected sizes, corresponding to each orf. a shuttle vector  capable of transforming bifidobacterium animalis mb209 was constructed by cloning pkj50 and a chloramphenicol resistance gene into pbr322.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacteria by random dna amplification.
AB  == rapd conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat dna analysis and separate dna extractions. five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum. the use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the rapd method for  the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. the results indicated that  this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their rapd profiles. using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of bifidobacterium (b. breve, b. bifidum and b. adolescentis),  based on similarity of the rapd profiles to known reference strains. furthermore, application of the rapd technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either b. longum/infantis or b. animalis/lactis).

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == identification of bifidobacteria from dairy products and evaluation of a microplate hybridization method.
AB  == sixteen strains of bifidobacterium isolated from 15 dairy products such as yogurt, cultured milk, butter and cheese were characterized on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and dna similarities were examined by a microplate hybridization method. three of the strains were identified as bifidodobacterium longum, one strain was identified as bifidobacterium bifidm, and one strain was assigned to the species bifidobacterium breve on the basis of phenotypic characteristics, and this identification was confirmed by the analysis of dna similarities. the remaining 11 strains could not be identified by examining their phenotypic characteristics and, contrary to the product label information, these  strains were identified as bifudidobacterium animalis on the basis of dna similarities. the applicability of the colorimetric hybridization method in micro dilution wells to genetic identification of bifidobacterium species was also studied.

TI  == characterization of the plasmid pmb1 from bifidobacterium longum and its use for  shuttle vector construction.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the 1847-bp bifidobacterium longum b2577 cryptic plasmid pmb1 was determined. the plasmid had a g+c content of 62.0%, and contained two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2, likely arranged in an operon. the proteins encoded by orf1 and orf2 show the highest degree of similarity with  similarly arranged peptide sequences translated from corynebacterium glutamicum pxz10142 and mycobacterium fortuitum pal5000 plasmids. recombinant plasmids containing the pmb1 replicon were able to replicate in bifidobacterium animalis mb209. the successful transformation of this strain with pmb1-based plasmids facilitated characterization of this replicon, results of which showed that both  orf1 and orf2 are necessary for plasmid replication. a family of new escherichia  coli-b. animalis shuttle plasmids, based on the pmb1 replicon and expressing a cat and an ery gene, was constructed.

TI  == differentiation of bifidobacteria by use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and  polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == several different genomic fingerprints can be obtained from various commercially-important species of bifidobacterium using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) following digestion of dna with xbai and spei. four different genomic finger printings were discernible for reference strains of bifidobacterium animalis, five for b. bifidum, three for b. breve, five for b. infantis and three for b. longum. standard commercially-available industrial strains of b. animalis are identical to the reference strain atcc 27536, previously isolated from chicken feces. there was more genomic heterogeneity among industrial strains of b. longum, in that only one gave profiles similar to  the type strain of this species (atcc 15707). the other 14 commercially-available strains of b. longum (mainly isolated from japanese commercial preparations) were divided into four new molecular types based on their pfge patterns. the pfge method indicated that only five distinct strains of b. longum and one strain of b. animalis are used in commercial preparations. additionally, the use of polymerase chain reaction amplification of portions of 16s rdna provides a highly specific technique to discriminate between the species b. breve, b. infantis and  b. longum.

TI  == characterization of fructose 6 phosphate phosphoketolases purified from bifidobacterium species.
AB  == fructose 6 phosphate phosphoketolases (f6ppks) were purified from bifidobacterium longum bb536, b. dentium atcc 27534, b. globosum atcc 25864, and bifidobacterium  animalis atcc 25527. concerning ions (cu++, zn++, ca++, mg++, fe++, co++, mn++) and common enzyme inhibitors (fructose, ammonium sulfate, iodoacetate, and parachloromercuribenzoic acid), no difference appeared between the enzymes. cu++, parachloromercuribenzoic acid (pcmb), and mercuric acetate induced high enzymatic inhibition. the study of pcmb demonstrated a noncompetitive inhibition. additional results showed that the sulfhydryl group was not involved in catalytic reaction. photooxidation experiments and determination of ionizable group pkas (5.16-7.17) suggested the presence of one or more histidines necessary for the catalytic reaction and explained the inhibition observed with pcmb. in light of the noncompetitive inhibition, this group was not directly involved in substrate  binding. determination of km demonstrated that the affinities for fructose 6 phosphate in the case of animal and human origin strains were close. in addition, the same enzymatic efficiency (kcat/km) was obtained for each strain. the f6ppk activity was regulated by sodium pyrophosphate, atp, and especially by adp.

TI  == selection of species-specific dna probes which detect strain restriction polymorphism in four bifidobacterium species.
AB  == randomly cloned fragments (in a size range 1 to 2.5 kb) of dna from bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, b. adolescentis cip 64.59t, b. bifidum cip 64.65 and b. animalis atcc 25527 were used as hybridization probes to characterize strains of these species and distinguish them from closely related bifidobacterium species. the fragments were screened for hybridization with native dna from 41 different bifidobacterium strains. for each species, a fragment hybridizing specifically with dna from strains of the same species was isolated. each fragment was then hybridized with restriction digests in order to  study the genome polymorphism. in some of the tested b. longum strains including  strain atcc 15707, the species-specific fragment l6/45 hybridized with 2 fragments instead of one as expected. sequence of the fragment revealed the presence of an orf which had an amino acid sequence similar to the site-specific  recombinases of lambda integrase family. moreover, southern analysis demonstrated that at least 3 copies of this fragment are present in the chromosome of b. longum atcc 15707 and in some other b. longum strains. the species-specific fragment a6/17 of b. adolescentis hybridized with the same restriction fragment on the eight strains of this species tested. the b. bifidum-specific fragment hybridized with different dna restriction fragments according to the strain. the  restriction fragment an1 from b. animalis atcc 25527 hybridized with the same restriction fragment from strain b. animalis atcc 27536. however, these two strains could be differentiated by another restriction pattern. thus, hybridization results highlight the genetic polymorphism which exists among bifidobacterium strains of the same species.

TI  == characterization of dairy-related bifidobacterium spp. based on their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns.
AB  == numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics based on enzymatic activity and  carbohydrate fermentation allowed the discrimination of most strains of bifidobacteria of animal origin from those of human origin. strains of bifidobacteria studied were separated into nine groups based on numerical analysis. three groups contained most strains of animal origin, three groups comprised both strains of animal and human origin, and three groups were strictly composed of strains of human origin. the results indicate that one group of animal origin (group ii) contained all reference strains of bifidobacterium animals and 10 strains isolated from fermented milks or commercial preparations.  although numerical analysis of enzymatic activities and carbohydrate fermentation patterns allowed the differentiation of 'wild' strains of b. animalis and b. longum isolated from commercial preparations, this method failed to confirm the species. in the present study, the determination of electrophoretic patterns of beta-galactosidases resulted in the development of a new technique for the differentiation of bifidobacterium species. several isoenzymes of beta-galactosidase were detected among strains of bifidobacteria. each species had a specific electrophoretic pattern. the detection of beta-galactosidase by electrophoresis is a new tool for distinguishing between dairy- and non-dairy-related bifidobacteria. dairy-related bifidobacteria (b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum) as well as b. animalis could be better differentiated from other bifidobacteria by comparison of their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns, rather than by numerical analysis of their phenotypic characteristics.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
