genetic and biochemical characterization of fus-1 (oxa-85), a narrow-spectrum class d beta-lactamase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.
antimicrobial resistance in brachyspira pilosicoli with special reference to point mutations in the 23s rrna gene associated with macrolide and lincosamide resistance.
a point mutation in the 23s rrna gene causes macrolide and lincosamide resistance in brachyspira hyodysenteriae. the possible occurrence of a similar mutation in brachyspira pilosicoli was studied and the mics of six antimicrobial agents for swedish field isolates of b. pilosicoli were determined. of 10 isolates with high mics of macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics, six had a mutation in nucleotide position 2058 or 2059 in the 23s rrna gene as compared to the wild type of escherichia coli, whereas none of 10 tylosin-susceptible isolates were mutated in this region. the mutations found in position 2058 were a --> t transversions, and in position 2059 either a --> g transitions or a --> c transversions. the mics at which 90% of the b. pilosicoli field isolates were inhibited by tylosin, erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, tiamulin, and carbadox, were >256, >256, >4, 4, 2, and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively. in conclusion, point mutations in positions 2058 and 2059 of the 23s rrna gene can cause macrolide and lincosamide resistance in b. pilosicoli. macrolide resistance is widespread among swedish field isolates of b. pilosicoli. notably also a few isolates with elevated mics of tiamulin were found.
