TI  - Novel biosensors based on flavonoid-responsive transcriptional regulators introduced into Escherichia coli.
AB  - This study describes the construction of two flavonoid biosensors, which can be applied for metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli strains. The biosensors are based on transcriptional regulators combined with autofluorescent proteins. The transcriptional activator FdeR from Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1 responds to naringenin, while the repressor QdoR from Bacillus subtilis is inactivated by quercetin and kaempferol. Both biosensors showed over a 7-fold increase of the fluorescent signal after addition of their specific effectors, and a linear correlation between the fluorescence intensity and externally added flavonoid concentration. The QdoR-biosensor was successfully applied for detection of kaempferol production in vivo at the single cell level by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Furthermore, the amount of kaempferol produced highly correlated with the specific fluorescence of E. coli cells containing a flavonol synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (fls1). We expect the designed biosensors to be applied for isolation of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathways.
TI  - The RecX protein interacts with the RecA protein and modulates its activity in Herbaspirillum seropedicae.
AB  - DNA repair is crucial to the survival of all organisms. The bacterial RecA protein is a central component in the SOS response and in recombinational and SOS DNA repairs. The RecX protein has been characterized as a negative modulator of RecA activity in many bacteria. The recA and recX genes of Herbaspirillum seropedicae constitute a single operon, and evidence suggests that RecX participates in SOS repair. In the present study, we show that the H. seropedicae RecX protein (RecX Hs) can interact with the H. seropedicaeRecA protein (RecA Hs) and that RecA Hs possesses ATP binding, ATP hydrolyzing and DNA strand exchange activities. RecX Hs inhibited 90% of the RecA Hs DNA strand exchange activity even when present in a 50-fold lower molar concentration than RecA Hs. RecA Hs ATP binding was not affected by the addition of RecX, but the ATPase activity was reduced. When RecX Hs was present before the formation of RecA filaments (RecA-ssDNA), inhibition of ATPase activity was substantially reduced and excess ssDNA also partially suppressed this inhibition. The results suggest that the RecX Hs protein negatively modulates the RecA Hs activities by protein-protein interactions and also by DNA-protein interactions.
TI  - Heat stability of Proteobacterial PII protein facilitate purification using a single chromatography step.
AB  - The P(II) proteins comprise a family of widely distributed signal transduction proteins that integrate the signals of cellular nitrogen, carbon and energy status, and then regulate, by protein-protein interaction, the activity of a variety of target proteins including enzymes, transcriptional regulators and membrane transporters. We have previously shown that the P(II) proteins from Azospirillum brasilense, GlnB and GlnZ, do not alter their migration behavior under native gel electrophoresis following incubated for a few minutes at 95 degrees C. This data suggested that P(II) proteins were either resistant to high temperatures and/or that they could return to their native state after having been unfolded by heat. Here we used (1)H NMR to show that the A. brasilense GlnB is stable up to 70 degrees C. The melting temperature (Tm) of GlnB was determined to be 84 degrees C using the fluorescent dye Sypro-Orange. P(II) proteins from other Proteobacteria also showed a high Tm. We exploited the thermo stability of P(II) by introducing a thermal treatment step in the P(II) purification protocol, this step significantly improved the homogeneity of A. brasilense GlnB and GlnZ, Herbaspirillum seropedicae GlnB and GlnK, and of Escherichia coli GlnK. Only a single chromatography step was necessary to obtain homogeneities higher than 95%. NMR(1) and in vitro uridylylation analysis showed that A. brasilense GlnB purified using the thermal treatment maintained its folding and activity. The purification protocol described here can facilitate the study of P(II) protein family members.
TI  - A transthyretin-related protein is functionally expressed in Herbaspirillum seropedicae.
AB  - Transthyretin-related proteins (TRPs) constitute a family of proteins structurally related to transthyretin (TTR) and are found in a large range of bacterial, fungal, plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate species. However, it was recently recognized that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of this family are not functionally related to transthyretins. TRPs are in fact involved in the purine catabolic pathway and function as hydroxyisourate hydrolases. An open reading frame encoding a protein similar to the Escherichia coli TRP was identified in Herbaspirillum seropedicae genome (Hs_TRP). It was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectrometry data confirmed the identity of this protein, and circular dichroism spectrum indicated a predominance of beta-sheet structure, as expected for a TRP. We have demonstrated that Hs_TRP is a 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase and by site-directed mutagenesis the importance of three conserved catalytic residues for Hs_TRP activity was further confirmed. The production of large quantities of this recombinant protein opens up the possibility of obtaining its 3D-structure and will help further investigations into purine catabolism.
TI  - The expression of nifB gene from Herbaspirillum seropedicae is dependent upon the NifA and RpoN proteins.
AB  - The putative nifB promoter region of Herbaspirillum seropedicae contained two sequences homologous to NifA-binding site and a -24/-12 type promoter. A nifB::lacZ fusion was assayed in the backgrounds of both Escherichia coli and H. seropedicae. In E. coli, the expression of nifB::lacZ occurred only in the presence of functional rpoN and Klebsiella pneumoniae nifA genes. In addition, the integration host factor (IHF) stimulated the expression of the nifB::lacZ fusion in this background. In H. seropedicae, nifB expression occurred only in the absence of ammonium and under low levels of oxygen, and it was shown to be strictly dependent on NifA. DNA band shift experiments showed that purified K. pneumoniae RpoN and E. coli IHF proteins were capable of binding to the nifB promoter region, and in vivo dimethylsulfate footprinting showed that NifA binds to both NifA-binding sites. These results strongly suggest that the expression of the nifB promoter of H. seropedicae is dependent on the NifA and RpoN proteins and that the IHF protein stimulates NifA activation of nifB promoter.
TI  - Expression, purification and biochemical characterization of a single-stranded DNA binding protein from Herbaspirillum seropedicae.
AB  - An open reading frame encoding a protein similar in size and sequence to the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB protein) was identified in the Herbaspirillum seropedicae genome. This open reading frame was cloned into the expression plasmid pET14b. The SSB protein from H. seropedicae, named Hs_SSB, was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectrometry data confirmed the identity of this protein. The apparent molecular mass of the native Hs_SSB was estimated by gel filtration, suggesting that the native protein is a tetramer made up of four similar subunits. The purified protein binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a similar manner to other SSB proteins. The production of this recombinant protein in good yield opens up the possibility of obtaining its 3D-structure and will help further investigations into DNA metabolism.
TI  - Effect of T- and C-loop mutations on the Herbaspirillum seropedicae GlnB protein  in nitrogen signalling.
AB  - Proteins of the PII family are found in species of all kingdoms. Although these proteins usually share high identity, their functions are specific to the different organisms. Comparison of structural data from Escherichia coli GlnB and GlnK and Herbaspirillum seropedicae GlnB showed that the T-loop and C-terminus were variable regions. To evaluate the role of these regions in signal transduction by the H. seropedicae GlnB protein, four mutants were constructed: Y51F, G108A/P109a, G108W and Q3R/T5A. The activities of the native and mutated proteins were assayed in an E. coli background constitutively expressing the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifLA operon. The results suggested that the T-loop and C-terminus regions of H. seropedicae GlnB are involved in nitrogen signal transduction.
TI  - Expression, purification, and DNA-binding activity of the Herbaspirillum seropedicae RecX protein.
AB  - The Herbaspirillum seropedicae RecX protein participates in the SOS response: a process in which the RecA protein plays a central role. The RecX protein of the H. seropedicae, fused to a His-tag sequence (RecX His-tagged), was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by metal-affinity chromatography to yield a highly purified and active protein. DNA band-shift assays showed that the RecX His-tagged protein bound to both circular and linear double-stranded DNA and also to circular single-stranded DNA. The apparent affinity of RecX for DNA decreased in the presence of Mg(2+) ions. The ability of RecX to bind DNA may be relevant to its function in the SOS response.
TI  - Fnr is involved in oxygen control of Herbaspirillum seropedicae N-truncated NifA  protein activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Herbaspirillum seropedicae is an endophytic diazotroph belonging to the beta-subclass of the class Proteobacteria, which colonizes many members of the Gramineae. The activity of the NifA protein, a transcriptional activator of nif genes in H. seropedicae, is controlled by ammonium ions through its N-terminal domain and by oxygen through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we report that the NifA protein of H. seropedicae is inactive and more susceptible to degradation in an fnr Escherichia coli background. Both effects correlate with oxygen exposure and iron deprivation. Our results suggest that the oxygen sensitivity and iron requirement for H. seropedicae NifA activity involve the Fnr protein.
TI  - Expression, purification, and functional analysis of the C-terminal domain of Herbaspirillum seropedicae NifA protein.
AB  - The Herbaspirillum seropedicae NifA protein is responsible for nif gene expression. The C-terminal domain of the H. seropedicae NifA protein, fused to a His-Tag sequence (His-Tag-C-terminal), was over-expressed and purified by metal-affinity chromatography to yield a highly purified and active protein. Band-shift assays showed that the NifA His-Tag-C-terminal bound specifically to the H. seropedicae nifB promoter region in vitro. In vivo analysis showed that this protein inhibited the Central + C-terminal domains of NifA protein from activating the nifH promoter of K. pneumoniae in Escherichia coli, indicating that the protein must be bound to the NifA-binding site (UAS site) at the nifH promoter region to activate transcription.
TI  - Control of autogenous activation of Herbaspirillum seropedicae nifA promoter by the IHF protein.
AB  - Analysis of the expression of the Herbaspirillum seropedicae nifA promoter in Escherichia coli and Herbaspirillum seropedicae, showed that nifA expression is primarily dependent on NtrC but also required NifA for maximal expression under nitrogen-fixing conditions. Deletion of the IHF (integration host factor)-binding site produced a promoter with two-fold higher activity than the native promoter in the H. seropedicae wild-type strain but not in a nifA strain, indicating that IHF controls NifA auto-activation. IHF is apparently required to prevent overexpression of the NifA protein via auto-activation under nitrogen-fixing conditions in H. seropedicae.
TI  - Uridylylation of the PII protein from Herbaspirillum seropedicae.
AB  - The PII protein is apparently involved in the control of NifA activity in Herbaspirillum seropedicae. To evaluate the probable role of PII in signal transduction, uridylylation assays were conducted with purified H. seropedicae PII and Escherichia coli GlnD, or a cell-free extract of H. seropedicae as sources of uridylylating activity. The results showed that alpha-ketoglutarate and ATP stimulate uridylylation whereas glutamine inhibits uridylylation. Deuridylylation of PII-UMP was dependent on glutamine and inhibited by ATP and alpha-ketoglutarate. PII uridylylation and (or) deuridylylation in response to these effectors suggests that PII is a nitrogen level signal transducer in H. seropedicae.
TI  - Use of lactose to induce expression of soluble NifA protein domains of Herbaspirillum seropedicae in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Overexpression and purification are procedures used to allow functional and structural characterization of proteins. Many overexpressed proteins are partially or completely insoluble, and can not be easily purified. The NifA protein is an enhancer-binding protein involved in activating the expression of nif and some fix genes. The NifA protein from many organisms is usually insoluble when over-expressed, and therefore difficult to work with in vitro. In this work we have overexpressed the central + C-terminal and the central domains of the Herbaspirrilum seropedicae NifA protein in an Escherichia coli background. Expression was induced with either IPTG or lactose. The data showed that induction with lactose promoted a significantly higher percentage of these proteins in the soluble fraction than with IPTG. This probably reflects a slower kinetics of induction by lactose.
TI  - Expression of the nifA gene of Herbaspirillum seropedicae: role of the NtrC and NifA binding sites and of the -24/-12 promoter element.
AB  - The nifA promoter of Herbaspirillum seropedicae contains potential NtrC, NifA and IHF binding sites together with a -12/-24 sigma(N)-dependent promoter. This region has now been investigated by deletion mutagenesis for the effect of NtrC and NifA on the expression of a nifA::lacZ fusion. A 5' end to the RNA was identified at position 641, 12 bp downstream from the -12/-24 promoter. Footprinting experiments showed that the G residues at positions -26 and -9 are hypermethylated, and that the region from -10 to +10 is partially melted under nitrogen-fixing conditions, confirming that this is the active nifA promoter. In H. seropedicae nifA expression from the sigma(N)-dependent promoter is repressed by fixed nitrogen but not by oxygen and is probably activated by the NtrC protein. NifA protein is apparently not essential for nifA expression but it can still bind the NifA upstream activating sequence.
TI  - In-trans regulation of the N-truncated-NIFA protein of Herbaspirillum seropedicae by the N-terminal domain.
AB  - The NifA protein is responsible for transcription activation of nif genes in the  endophytic diazotroph Herbaspirillum seropedicae. When expressed in Escherichia coli this NifA protein is unable to activate the transcription of a Klebsiella pneumoniae nifH::lacZ fusion. However, a form of NifA lacking the N-terminal domain did activate transcription and its activity was not inhibited by ammonium. In this work we show that when expressed separately, the N-terminal domain of H. seropedicae NifA protein can restore ammonium control of the N-truncated NifA activity in E. coli. This effect is dependent on the relative concentrations of the N-terminal domain and the N-truncated protein and suggests that the N-terminal domain behaves in this respect in a manner similar to that of NifL of the gamma proteobacteria.
TI  - Expression and functional analysis of an N-truncated NifA protein of Herbaspirillum seropedicae.
AB  - In Herbaspirillum seropedicae, an endophytic diazotroph, nif gene expression is under the control of the transcriptional activator NifA. We have over-expressed and purified a protein containing the central and C-terminal domains of the H. seropedicae NifA protein, N-truncated NifA, fused to a His-Tag sequence. This fusion protein was found to be partially soluble and was purified by affinity chromatography. Band shift and footprinting assays showed that the N-truncated NifA protein was able to bind specifically to the H. seropedicae nifB promoter region. In vivo analysis showed that this protein activated the nifH promoter of Klebsiella pneumoniae in Escherichia coli only in the absence of oxygen and this activation was not negatively controlled by ammonium ions.
TI  - Control of Herbaspirillum seropedicae NifA activity by ammonium ions and oxygen.
AB  - The activity of a truncated form of Herbaspirillum seropedicae NifA in different  genetic backgrounds showed that its regulatory domain is involved in nitrogen control but not in O2 sensitivity or Fe dependence. The model for nitrogen control involving PII could thus apply to the proteobacteria at large. NifA may have a role in controlling ADP-ribosylation of nitrogenase in Azospirillum brasilense.
TI  - Cloning of a recA-like gene from the diazotroph Herbaspirillum seropedicae strain Z78.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid, pBMR5, carrying a recA-like gene of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, was isolated from a H. seropedicae genomic library by intergeneric complementation of Escherichia coli recA mutant strain HB101. Quantitative survival experiments showed that pBMR5 restored the ultraviolet radiation and methyl methanesulfonate resistances and recombinational proficiency of this strain. Hybridization studies showed that there is DNA sequence homology between the recA gene of E. coli K12 and that of H. seropedicae. Restriction sites for EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, and Bg/II were found in the DNA insert derived from H. seropedicae in pBMR5. A Tn5 insertional mutant of pBMR5, called pBMR26.2, failed to restore recombination proficiency and methyl methanesulfonate and ultraviolet resistance to recA mutants of E. coli.
