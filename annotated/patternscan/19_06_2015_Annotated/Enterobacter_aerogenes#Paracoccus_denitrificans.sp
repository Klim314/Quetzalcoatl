TI  == transcriptional regulation, metal binding properties and structure of pden1597, an unusual zinc transport protein from paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters of the cluster 9 family are ubiquitous among bacteria and essential for acquiring zn(2+) and mn(2+) from the environment or, in the case of pathogens, from the host. these rely on a substrate-binding protein (sbp) to coordinate the relevant metal with high affinity and specificity and subsequently release it to a membrane permease for translocation into the cytoplasm. although a number of cluster 9 sbp structures have been determined, the structural attributes conferring zn(2+) or mn(2+) specificity remain ambiguous. here we describe the gene expression profile, in vitro metal binding properties, and crystal structure of a new cluster 9 sbp from paracoccus denitrificans we have called aztc. although all of our results strongly indicate  zn(2+) over mn(2+) specificity, the zn(2+) ion is coordinated by a conserved asp  residue only observed to date as a metal ligand in mn(2+)-specific sbps. the unusual sequence properties of this protein are shared among close homologues, including members from the human pathogens klebsiella pneumonia and enterobacter  aerogenes, and would seem to suggest a subclass of zn(2+)-specific transporters among the cluster 9 family. in any case, the unusual coordination environment of  aztc expands the already considerable range of those available to zn(2+)-specific sbps and highlights the presence of a his-rich loop as the most reliable indicator of zn(2+) specificity.
