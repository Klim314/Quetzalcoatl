TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on bacterial growth on human ossicles explanted from cholesteatoma patients.
AB  == background: high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment can eliminate cholesteatoma cells from explanted human ossicles prior to re-insertion. we analyzed the effects of hhp treatment on the microbial flora on ossicles and on the planktonic and biofilm states of selected isolates. methodology: twenty-six ossicles were explanted from cholesteatoma patients. five ossicles were directly analyzed for microbial growth without further treatment. fifteen ossicles were cut into two pieces. one piece was exposed to hhp of 350 mpa for 10 minutes. both the treated  and untreated (control) pieces were then assessed semi-quantitatively. three ossicles were cut into two pieces and exposed to identical pressure conditions with or without the addition of one of two different combinations of antibiotics  to the medium. differential effects of 10-minute in vitro exposure of planktonic  and biofilm bacteria to pressures of 100 mpa, 250 mpa, 400 mpa and 540 mpa in isotonic and hypotonic media were analyzed using two patient isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis and neisseria subflava. bacterial cell inactivation and biofilm destruction were assessed by colony counting and electron microscopy. principal findings: a variety of microorganisms were isolated from the ossicles.  irrespective of the medium, hhp treatment at 350 mpa for 10 minutes led to satisfying but incomplete inactivation especially of gram-negative bacteria. the  addition of antibiotics increased the efficacy of elimination. a comparison of hhp treatment of planktonic and biofilm cells showed that the effects of hpp were reduced by about one decadic logarithmic unit when hpp was applied to biofilms. high hydrostatic pressure conditions that are suitable to inactivate cholesteatoma cells fail to completely sterilize ossicles even if antibiotics are added. as a result of the reduced microbial load and the viability loss of surviving bacteria, however, there is a lower risk of re-infection after re-insertion.

TI  == efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  == imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. the mean duration of treatment was  29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. causative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, s. aureus plus group b streptococcus in one, viridans group streptococcus in two, neisseria subflava, eikenella corrodens, and group g  streptococcus in one patient, and staphylococcus epidermidis, hemophilus aphrophilus, and enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. the minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04  micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against h. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against e. aerogenes. the site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. the mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. all patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one  patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on day 26 of therapy. imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm  statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.

TI  == is there a specific stimulus of infectious-allergic bronchial asthma?
AB  == 1. pigmented neisseria species (neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca) are constant inhabitants of patients with infectious asthma. 2. of all the diverse bronchial microflora of patients with infectious-allergic bronchial asthma, the pigmented neisseria species (neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca), staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis), klebsiella (klebsiella pneumoniae) are active sensitizers of the human broncho-pulmonary tract. 3. neisseria strains, possessing similar antigenic determinants to human lung tissues, possess the highest allergenic activity. this raises the question of a new criterion for evaluating the allergenicity of cultures according to their antigenic characteristics. 4. in patients with infectious asthma allergy might develop to some of the structures of microbial cells, in which antigenic determinants, similar to human lung tissues are localized.

TI  == inhibition of growth of n. gonorrhoeae by bacterial interference.
AB  == observations made in our laboratory during the past 3 years showed that the growth of some neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures was inhibited in the presence of various bacterial contaminants of urogenital specimens. a total of 647 cultures confirmed as containing n. gonorrhoeae were examined in this study. the first part of the study was carried out on 520 n. gonorrhoeae cultures. of these 520 cultures, 110 (21.1%) showed contamination on purity plates (gc medium, antibiotic-free). when further subcultured, 96 (87.3%) of the n. gonorrhoeae strains grew in pure culture, but 14 (12.7%) failed to grow. subsequently, experiments were carried out on 127 pure n. gonorrhoeae cultures. the bacterial species that inhibited the growth of n. gonorrhoeae are listed in order of frequency: neisseria meningitidis, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group a, and neisseria subflava.
