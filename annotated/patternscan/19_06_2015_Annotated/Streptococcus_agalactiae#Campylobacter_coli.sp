TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == the group b streptococcal sialic acid o-acetyltransferase is encoded by neud, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  == nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (sia), and several sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. some pathogens are also known to o-acetylate their sias, although  the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. we report that neud, a gene located within the group b streptococcus (gbs) sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a sia o-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (cps) sialylation. homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified lys-123 as a critical residue for sia o-acetyltransferase activity. moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neud can determine whether gbs displays a "high" or "low" sia o-acetylation phenotype. complementation analysis  revealed that escherichia coli k1 neud also functions as a sia o-acetyltransferase in gbs. in fact, neud homologs are commonly found within sia  biosynthetic gene clusters. a bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neud. included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens legionella pneumophila, vibrio parahemeolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for sia expression. phylogenetic analysis shows that neud homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-sia o-acetyltransferase of e.  coli k1. these studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of gbs sia o-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == study of haemolytic activity of some campylobacter spp. on blood agar plates.
AB  == a total of 152 strains of campylobacter jejuni, c. coli, c. laridis and c. fetus  subsp. fetus were tested for haemolysis on blood agar plates. distinct haemolysis was detected in 92.3% (96/104) of strains of c. jejuni and 21.7% (5/23) of strains of c. coli on sheep blood heart infusion agar after incubation for 4 d microaerobically at 42 degrees c. haemolysis was also detected on horse blood heart infusion agar. haemolysis was not detected at 37 degrees c except with one  of 50 strains of c. jejuni tested at this temperature, which was weakly positive. campylobacter laridis was not haemolytic; c. fetus subsp. fetus, which does not grow at 42 degrees c, showed no haemolysis at 37 degrees c. blood agar (oxoid, ba base no. 2) was not suitable for testing for haemolysis by these organisms. a microaerobic gas mixture containing hydrogen is better than that containing nitrogen because the medium has a brighter colour, making haemolysis easier to detect. there was no synergistic haemolysis with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. the plate haemolysis test as described here may aid differentiation within the thermophilic campylobacters.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == dna probes for identification of tetracycline resistance genes in campylobacter species isolated from swine and cattle.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant strains of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli from swine and cattle colons were isolated and characterized by hybridization with dna probes. a probe consisting of the 1.8-kilobase (kb) hincii fragment from pua466 was highly specific for the detection of tetracycline resistance (tcr) in  c. jejuni and c. coli. the 5-kb tetm dna probe from streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pji3 which has homology with the 1.8-kb hincii fragment from pua466 could also be used to detect tcr campylobacter strains. however, the tetm probe had a much lower sensitivity and required a lower stringency of hybridization. therefore, the 1.8-kb hincii fragment appeared to be more appropriate for the classification of tcr in campylobacter spp. no homology was detected between the  tcr determinant from campylobacter spp. and the tetl and tetn probes from streptococcus spp. dna homology was demonstrated between pua649, a derivative of  plasmid pua466 which had lost most of the tcr region, and tcr plasmids from c. jejuni and c. coli isolated from animal and human sources. there was also homology between pua649 and the chromosomes of c. jejuni and c. coli strains. in  this study, all but one of the tetracycline-resistant c. coli and c. jejuni strains contained plasmids of approximately 50 kb which hybridized with the 1.8-kb hincii probe. in one c. coli strain (ua703), tcr appeared to be chromosomally mediated.

TI  == two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for the specific detection of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms.
AB  == glycine, one of the end products of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by a rapid, specific technique utilizing two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. a loopful of growth of each organism from its suitable agar medium was washed, suspended, and incubated with 0.1% sodium hippurate for 30 min at 37 degrees c. the supernatant of the incubated suspension from each organism was then dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. glycine, a product of hippurate hydrolysis, was detected under uv light. this technique does not require prolonged incubation and was found to be more specific and reliable than the standard ninhydrin reaction. in addition, it is inexpensive and can be easily conducted in a clinical microbiological reference laboratory. by this method, 100% (22/22) of campylobacter jejuni and 0% (0/9) of campylobacter coli reference strains were positive. in addition, 100% (13/13) of group b streptococci, 100% (24/24) of group d streptococci, and 90% (18/20) of gardenerella vaginalis clinical isolates were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. this method is useful for the identification to the species level of campylobacter organisms and the biotyping of gardnerella organisms and for the detection of hippurate hydrolysis  by unknown microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
