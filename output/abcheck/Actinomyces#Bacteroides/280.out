increased periodontal bone loss in temporarily b lymphocyte-deficient rats.
in order to study the role of t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes in the development  of marginal periodontitis, experiments were performed on specific-pathogen-free (spf) rats with various immunologic profiles.
the study comprised nude (congenitally t lymphocyte-deficient), thymus-grafted nude (t-lymphocyte reconstituted), anti-mu treated (temporarily b lymphocyte-deficient), and normal rats.
when they were 5 to 9 weeks old, some of the rats were inoculated with actinomyces viscosus.
bacteroides gingivalis and a strain of oral spirochetes; 90 days later they were killed. a. viscosus and b. gingivalis colonized readily, but the spirochete strain could not be established permanently in the oral cavity of the rats, 95% of the inoculated rats raised serum igg or igm antibody against one or more of the microorganisms; nude rats tended to raise less antibody than the three other experimental groups.
inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than controls.
anti-mu treated inoculated rats had significantly less periodontal bone support than nude and normal rats, whereas no difference was found between normal, nude, and thymus-grafted rats.
it is concluded that permanent t-lymphocyte deficiency did not interfere with the development of periodontal disease in this model, whereas a temporary and moderate reduction in b-lymphocyte numbers seemed to predispose for aggravation of periodontal bone loss.
