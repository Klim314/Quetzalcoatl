TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.
