TI  - Destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  Raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. Raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. However, before Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic identification. Prior to the isolation, a liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture Pronase E is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. The extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with 6.107 to 6.104 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus. The compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a Raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A classification of single-cell Raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. Graphical Abstract Development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by Raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Influence of the magnetic field on microorganisms in the oral cavity.
AB  - Since the beginning of their lives, all living organisms are exposed to the influence of geomagnetic fields. OBJECTIVES: With respect to the positive effects that magnetic fields have on human tissues, especially the bactericidal effect, this investigation aimed to assess their influence on the reduction of oral microorganisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to obtain adequate specimens of dental plaque deposit, microbes such as Streptococcus parasanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Rhodococcus equi and Candida albicans were isolated from the human mouth. To establish the intensity of microbial growth on the basis of the modified optical density (OD) of agar turbidimetry assay, microbial count and spectrophotometry were applied. The study was carried out with two microbial concentrations (1 and 10 CFU/ml) after periods of incubation of 24 and 48 h and using micromagnets. RESULTS: A positive effect of the magnetic field, resulting in the reduction of dental plaque microbes in vitro, was found. In the first 24 hours of exposure to the magnetic field, the number of all isolated microbes was significantly reduced. The most potent influence of magnets and the most intensified reduction after 24 hours were evident in Candida albicans colonies. The decrease in the influence of magnets on microbes in vitro was also detected. CONCLUSIONS: Magnets reduce the number of microbes and might be recommended as a supplement in therapy for reduced periodontal tissues. This is important because periodontal tissues that are in good conditions provide prolonged support to the oral tissues under partial and supradental denture.
TI  - Metagenomic Analysis of Milk of Healthy and Mastitis-Suffering Women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have been conducted to assess the composition of the bacterial communities inhabiting human milk, but they did not evaluate the presence of other microorganisms, such as fungi, archaea, protozoa, or viruses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the metagenome of human milk samples provided by healthy and mastitis-suffering women. METHODS: DNA was isolated from human milk samples collected from 10 healthy women and 10 women with symptoms of lactational mastitis. Shotgun libraries from total extracted DNA were constructed and the libraries were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. RESULTS: The amount of human DNA sequences was >/= 90% in all the samples. Among the bacterial sequences, the predominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. The healthy core microbiome included the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Propionibacterium. At the species level, a high degree of inter-individual variability was observed among healthy women. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus clearly dominated the microbiome in the samples from the women with acute mastitis whereas high increases in Staphylococcus epidermidis-related reads were observed in the milk of those suffering from subacute mastitis. Fungal and protozoa-related reads were identified in most of the samples, whereas Archaea reads were absent in samples from women with mastitis. Some viral-related sequence reads were also detected. CONCLUSION: Human milk contains a complex microbial metagenome constituted by the genomes of bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. In mastitis cases, the milk microbiome reflects a loss of bacterial diversity and a high increase of the sequences related to the presumptive etiological agents.
TI  - Development of Gendine Coated Cannula for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion for Extended Use.
AB  - Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. One of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of CSII is CSII set related issues including infection at the infusion site. Current American Diabetic Association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. This adds cost and creates inconvenience. Therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a Teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (Gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. Cannulas were coated with Gendine on exterior surface and dried. Efficacy and durability of Gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. Cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. Gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (P < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. Gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. Our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.
TI  - Colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  - Microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. Bacterial DNA was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy Slovenian mothers. Characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). PCR screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on DNA of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. DGGE profiling revealed the presence of Staphylococcus and Gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance of 3 bands: Staphylococcus epidermidis/Gemella, Streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and Streptococcus salivarius. Bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. High prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qPCR for enterobacteria (100%), Clostridia (95.6%), Bacteroides-Prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). Bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; Staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. The quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. The majority of the genus Staphylococcus was represented by the species Staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. Determinants of salivaricin A, salivaricin B, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. This work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating Slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.
TI  - Characterisation of clinical meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis demonstrating high levels of linezolid resistance (>256 mug/ml) resulting from transmissible and mutational mechanisms.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), one of the leading etiological agents of nosocomial infections poses a significant economic burden globally. Introduced in 2000, linezolid (LZD) has become an important antibiotic, used in nearly seventy countries worldwide to treat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species along with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Resistance to LZD in clinical settings remains rare. Here, we report the emergence of meticillin resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) clinical isolates from two voluntary general acute hospitals exhibiting higher than typically reported levels of LZD resistance (MIC>256 mug/ml). The MRSE ST-2 clone isolated from eight patients (2010-2011) not only possessed resistance-conferring mutations such as G2576T in domain V of 23S rRNA gene (as determined by HRM-PCR analysis) and R172C substitution in the ribosomal protein L3, but also carried the cfr gene (the only known transmissible mechanism of LZD resistance). All isolates possessed several key biofilm-associated genes (such as icaA, icaD, aap and atlE) and resistance to multiple clinically significant antibiotics was recorded. This study reports the earliest incidence (2010) of clinical MRSE in the Republic of Ireland demonstrating multiple LZD resistance mechanisms both mutational and potentially transmissible, and characterises this emerging resistance from a molecular perspective.
TI  - Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility and occurrence of selected resistance genes in gram-positive mastitis pathogens isolated from Wisconsin dairy cows.
AB  - In the United States, few intramammary antimicrobials exist that are approved for treatment of bovine mastitis; thus, ensuring judicious use of these products is a priority. The objectives of this study were to determine phenotypic susceptibility and presence of selected antimicrobial resistance genes from staphylococci, streptococci, and streptococcal-like organisms recovered from cases of clinical mastitis occurring in cows on large Wisconsin farms. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35 from 19 herds), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 51 from 30 herds), Streptococcus spp. (n = 78 from 36 herds), and streptococcal-like organisms (n = 31 from 19 herds) were used in this study. All Staphylococcus spp. were susceptible to ceftiofur, cephalothin, and the combination of penicillin and novobiocin. Of all staphylococci, only a single Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited phenotypic resistance to oxacillin. Phenotypic susceptibility to erythromycin was observed in only 8.6 and 15.7% of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. Approximately 20% of staphylococci and 13 to 22% of streptococci and streptococcal-like organisms exhibited phenotypic resistance to pirlimycin. All Streptococcus spp. exhibited phenotypic susceptibility to ceftiofur, cephalothin, and oxacillin. The proportion of isolates exhibiting phenotypic susceptibility to pirlimycin and sulfadimethoxine differed among Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. All streptococcal-like organisms exhibited phenotypic susceptibility to ceftiofur, cephalothin, oxacillin, penicillin, and the combination of penicillin and novobiocin. Of all organisms tested, 36.9% did not carry any of the resistance genes (ermC, blaZ, tetK, or tetM), 35.4% carried 1 gene, and 27.7% carried multiple genes (usually blaZ in combination with a tet gene). Eighteen (51.4%) Staph. aureus and 12 (48.0%) Staphylococcus chromogenes carried multiple resistance genes. Six (12.2%) Strep. dysgalactiae and no Strep. uberis carried multiple resistance genes. Results indicate that most gram-positive mastitis organisms were susceptible to most antimicrobials used for intramammary administration, but some resistance to drugs used for systemic treatment of mastitis was noted. The presence of selected resistance genes was not proportional to the occurrence of phenotypic resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  - CONTEXT: Preparations from Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from A. heterophyllus heartwoods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered A. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). Their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. The extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/mL, respectively. Based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. Among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. mutans, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis with MICs of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, and MBCs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 12.9 and 25.8 microM, respectively. Only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 286.4 microM.
TI  - [Apoptogenic activity of microbes-associants during Epstein-Barr virus infection].
AB  - AIM: Study apoptogenic activity of-microbes-associants during Epstein-Barr virus  infection (EBVI) on the model of mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation of apoptosis induced by bacteria isolated from EBVI patients was carried out by characteristic morphological changes of macrophages in smears stained by May-Grunwald with additional staining by Romanowsky-Giemsa. RESULTS: All the EBVI microbes-associants were established to have apoptogenic activity, however, the highest pathogenic potential was noted in Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSION: The presence of apoptogenic activity in bacterial microflora accompanying EBVI against immune system cells could serve as means of their survival and be the pathogenetic basis for prolonged persistence in the organism.
TI  - A C-type lectin from Bothrops jararacussu venom disrupts Staphylococcal biofilms.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is a major threat to animal health and the dairy industry. Staphylococcus aureus is a contagious pathogen that is usually associated with persistent intramammary infections, and biofilm formation is a relevant aspect of the outcome of these infections. Several biological activities have been described for snake venoms, which led us to screen secretions of Bothrops jararacussu for antibiofilm activity against S. aureus NRS155. Crude venom was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were tested against S. aureus. Biofilm growth, but not bacterial growth, was affected by several fractions. Two fractions (15 and 16) showed the best activities and were also assayed against S. epidermidis NRS101. Fraction 15 was identified by TripleTOF mass spectrometry as a galactose-binding C-type lectin with a molecular weight of 15 kDa. The lectin was purified from the crude venom by D-galactose affinity chromatography, and only one peak was observed. This pure lectin was able to inhibit 75% and 80% of S. aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms, respectively, without affecting bacterial cell viability. The lectin also exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both bacterial biofilms. The antibiofilm activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. A pre-formed S. epidermidis biofilm was significantly disrupted by the C-type lectin in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, the lectin demonstrated the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by several mastitis pathogens, including different field strains of S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. chromogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Escherichia coli. These findings reveal a new activity for C-type lectins. Studies are underway to evaluate the biological activity of these lectins in a mouse mastitis model.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as  FtsZ inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. The results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. Among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-MBA) against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-MBA but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of S. aureus ATCC29213. Particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/mL) against S. pyogenes PS, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-MBA, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. In addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of cell division against S. aureus ATCC25923, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/mL.
TI  - Platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  - Platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. Platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, FcgammaRII, Toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as GPIIb-IIIa or GPIb. Bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement C1q, the von Willebrand Factor, etc. The fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. Several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. Are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? Indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on S. aureus. Besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for Streptococcus sanguinis, S. epidermidis, or C. pneumoniae. On the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. We, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. Moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. Indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. In conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  - Abstract Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. Materials and methods. The growth of selected bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. The content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with HPLC-ESI-MS. Results. The spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. Sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. Total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with pH varying between 4.1-5.4. Conclusions. The present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice pH explains bacterial in vitro growth. This may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.
TI  - Introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  - Peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. They are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. New implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. The aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-N-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (VP:DMMEP 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. With a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. In contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. These data confirm the hypothesis that VP:DMMEP 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.
TI  - Microbiology of Pelvic Lymphocyst Infection after Lymphadenectomy for Malignant Gynecologic Tumors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. Although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. The purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between October 2002 and March 2013. The participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. Computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. RESULTS: During the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors, and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. Cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus (three patients), S. epidermidis (one patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), Enterococcus (two patients), Escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). They were all monomicrobial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study and other smaller ones suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. These bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein and Peptide concentrations and activity in human breast milk consumed by preterm infants at risk of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the levels and antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) in breast milk consumed by preterm infants, and whether deficiencies of these factors were associated with late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), a bacterial infection that frequently occurs in preterm infants in the neonatal period. STUDY DESIGN: Breast milk from mothers of preterm infants (</= 32 weeks gestation) was collected on days 7 (n = 88) and 21 (n = 77) postpartum. Concentrations of lactoferrin, LL-37, beta-defensins 1 and 2, and alpha-defensin 5 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The antimicrobial activity of breast milk samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae was compared to the activity of infant formula, alone or supplemented with physiological levels of AMPs. Samples of breast milk fed to infants with and without subsequent LOS were compared for levels of AMPs and inhibition of bacterial growth. RESULTS: Levels of most AMPs and antibacterial activity in preterm breast milk were higher at day 7 than at day 21. Lactoferrin was the only AMP that limited pathogen growth >50% when added to formula at a concentration equivalent to that present in breast milk. Levels of AMPs were similar in the breast milk fed to infants with and without LOS, however, infants who developed LOS consumed significantly less breast milk and lower doses of milk AMPs than those who were free from LOS. CONCLUSIONS: The concentrations of lactoferrin and defensins in preterm breast milk have antimicrobial activity against common neonatal pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of Citrus sinensis.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of Citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcesnces, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter amnigenus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Serratia odorifera. Methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. In vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. It was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of C. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of S. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). The potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. The order of antioxidant activity through ABTS.+ and DPPH free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. Phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. It was also found that Chloroform/Methanol (5:5) and Butanol/Ethanol/Water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. These findings reveal the potential use of C. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.
TI  - Temporal dynamics of the very premature infant gut dominant microbiota.
AB  - BackgroundThe very-preterm infant gut microbiota is increasingly explored due to  its probable role in the development of life threatening diseases. Results of high-throughput studies validate and renew the interest in approaches with lower resolution such as PCR-Temporal Temperature Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) for the follow-up of dominant microbiota dynamics. We report here an extensive longitudinal study of gut colonization in very preterm infants. We explored by 16S rDNA-based PCR-TTGE a total of 354 stool specimens sampled during routine monitoring from the 1st to the 8th week of life in 30 very pre-term infants born before 30 weeks of gestational age.ResultsCombining comparison with a diversity ladder and sequencing allowed affiliation of 50 Species-Level Operational Taxonomic Units (SLOTUs) as well as semi-quantitative estimation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Coagulase-negative staphylococci, mainly the Staphylococcus epidermidis, was found in all the infants during the study period and was the most represented (75.7% of the SLOTUs) from the first days of life. Enterococci, present in 60% of the infants were early, highly represented and persistent colonizers of the premature gut. Later Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Clostridium appeared and were found in 10 (33%) and 21 infants (70%), respectively. We showed a high representation of Veillonella in more than a quarter of the infants and being able to persistently colonize premature gut. The genera Anaerococcus, Aquabacterium, Bacillus, Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, Oceanobacillus, Propionibacterium, Pseudomonas, Rothia, Sarcina, Sneathia and Streptococcus were observed as transient or persistent colonizers, each genus being found in a minority of infants.ConclusionsDespite low resolution, PCR-TTGE remains complementary to high-throughput sequencing-based approaches because it allows the follow-up of dominant bacteria in gut microbiota in a large longitudinal cohorts of preterm neonates. We described the development of pre-term gut microbiota that should be now replaced regarding the functional role of major OTUs.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial analysis of aqueous humor after topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous humor in patients who had preoperative topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Twenty-nine eyes from 29 cataract surgery patients were included in this study. In the study group (n = 15 eyes), 3 topical applications of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% were administered preoperatively; in the control group (n = 14 eyes), no topical applications were administered. Aqueous humor samples were collected and stored in sterile microtubes at -80 degrees C until analysis. Antimicrobial analysis was performed using standard strains with standard sterile filter paper disks. Inhibition halos were measured in millimeters, and both bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects were analyzed. RESULTS: Inhibition halos were observed on most of the study group plates except those with Streptococcus pneumoniae: Escherichia coli (13.93 mm +/- 0.64 [SD]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.63 +/- 0.61 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (7.47 +/- 0.68 mm), and S epidermidis (4.20 +/- 3.33 mm) The differences between the mean inhibition halo diameters were statistically significant (P < .0001) in all samples. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: After topical application of moxifloxacin 0.5%, aqueous humor showed bacteriostatic effect against E coli, K pneumoniae, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms evaluated. No antimicrobial effect against S pneumoniae was observed.

TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  - The purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. Two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. In experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip A: 1% H2O2; dip B: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip C: 1% iodophor; and dip D: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. Four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma bovis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. In experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip A; dip D; and dip E: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. Experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Species differences were also found where Mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. Experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips D and E and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. No differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip A. It can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. Furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for H2O2 dips may be optimal in reducing pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. A reduction in premilking teat dip contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.
TI  - Synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. The treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 1% proteinase K and 2% CHX (with and without ultrasonics). 2% CHX was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (P < 0.05). The viable counts of the proteinase K and CHX group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu mL-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/- 1.36 log10 cfu mL-1 ) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) as compared with the untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu mL-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu mL-1 ). The CHX group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase K. CONCLUSION: The trypsin and CHX group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  - Current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. In line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated for their relative DNA binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. Encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against Gram-positive (including resistant MRSA, MRSE, VRE strains) and Gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. The bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with MIC of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of sensitive and resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest DNA binding affinity (DeltaTm of 15.4 degrees C). Asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. Molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with DNA, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. Herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial DNA binding agents.
TI  - Antibacterial compounds from Salvia adenophora Fernald (Lamiaceae).
AB  - From the aerial parts of Salvia adenophora Fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. Compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. The structures were established by extensive 1D, 2D NMR and HRESI-TOFMS spectroscopic methods. Finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ECD spectra. Despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on Gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, Staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against S. epidermidis. Interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. No action was reported on Gram-negative strains nor on Candida albicans. These results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.
TI  - Oral bacterial DNA findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial DNA can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. Some case reports describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with PCR; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial PCR has not been used as a diagnostic method before. OBJECTIVE: To find out whether bacterial DNA can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at Tampere University Hospital during 2009-2010. Of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (CAD), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe CAD. Bacterial DNA amounts were determined using real-time quantitative PCR with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (Streptococcus mitis group, Streptococcus anginosus group, Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatus, and Dialister pneumosintes). RESULTS: Of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. Only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. There was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial DNA in the pericardial fluid and the severity of CAD (p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Oral bacterial DNA was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of CAD and the total amount of bacterial DNA in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.
TI  - Infectious Keratitis Following Corneal Crosslinking: A Systematic Review of Reported Cases: Management, Visual Outcome, and Treatment Proposed.
AB  - Abstract Aim: To describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. Methods: A Medline (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) search from October 2000 to October 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. Nineteen articles were selected. Ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. Nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in German, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. Results: A total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. The infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus S. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (E. coli; P. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (Fusarium and Microsporidia) (20%), and Acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). Conclusions: Only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. The most virulent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acanthamoeba. Less virulent organisms were Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. Two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. The most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - DNA extraction methods for panbacterial and panfungal PCR detection in intraocular fluids.
AB  - PURPOSE: Three different methods of DNA extraction from intraocular fluids were compared with subsequent detection for bacterial and fungal DNA by universal PCR amplification. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three DNA extraction methods, from aqueous and vitreous humors, were evaluated to compare their relative efficiency. Bacterial (Gram positive and negative) and fungal strains were used in this study: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. The quality, quantification, and detection limit for DNA extraction and PCR amplification were analyzed. Validation procedures for 13 aqueous humor and 14 vitreous samples, from 20 patients with clinically suspected endophthalmitis were carried out. RESULTS: The column-based extraction method was the most time-effective, achieving DNA detection limits >/=10(2) and 10(3 )CFU/100 microL for bacteria and fungi, respectively. PCR amplification detected 100 fg, 1 pg and 10 pg of genomic DNA of E. coli, S. epidermidis and C. albicans respectively. PCR detected 90.0% of the causative agents from 27 intraocular samples collected from 20 patients with clinically suspected endophthalmitis, while standard microbiological techniques could detect only 60.0%. The most frequently found organisms were Streptococcus spp. in 38.9% (n = 7) of patients and Staphylococcus spp. found in 22.2% (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The column-based extraction method for very small inocula in small volume samples (50-100 microL) of aqueous and/or vitreous humors allowed PCR amplification in all samples with sufficient quality for subsequent sequencing and identification of the microorganism in the majority of them.
TI  - False negative beta-2 transferrin in the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak in the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objectives of this study were to examine the presence  of beta-2 transferrin (beta2TRNSF) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contaminated in vitro by various bacteria and explore the mechanism (passive or active) responsible for beta2TRNSF elimination. Early diagnosis of CSF leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. beta2TRNSF is a protein present exclusively in CSF. Its detection is highly useful in cases of CSF leakage, although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective patient analysis. METHODS: Sterile CSF drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta2TRNSF was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. Samples of CSF inoculated with S pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. For beta2TRNSF analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: CSF samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. beta2TRNSF was not detected following S pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. Quantitative analysis using ELISA demonstrated significant beta2TRNSF concentration decrease. The addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. CONCLUSIONS: CSF leak detection using beta2TRNSF may be deceiving in the presence of a S pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection. A passive process is suggested, as beta2TRNSF disappeared either immediately or following incubation with inactive bacteria.
TI  - Collagen barrier membranes may accelerate bacterial growth in vitro: a potential  clinical risk to regenerative procedures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the antibacterial properties of three commercial collagen membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR). METHOD AND MATERIALS: BioGide(R), OsseoGuard(R), and CopiOs(R) membranes were tested for antibacterial properties against Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a direct contact test (DCT). Samples of each membrane, sized 5 x 2 mm, were fixed to the side wall of 6 wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. Bacterial suspension was placed on each sample. The plate was incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hour to allow suspension fluid evaporation. Fresh medium was added to each well and the plate was mixed. Non-contaminated membrane samples served as negative control. Bacterial growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 650 nm for 24 hours. ANOVA and Tukey's comparison tests were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The presence of the membrane samples did not disrupt bacterial growth. However, the presence of OsseoGuard membrane accelerated bacterial growth rate of S sanguinis and S epidermidis as compared to the other two membranes and control samples (P < .001), and of S aureus as compared to the control alone (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The tested collagen membranes have no antibacterial properties. However, OsseoGuard presents a significant bacterial growth enhancement effect with possible significant clinical implications on the success of regenerative procedures around teeth and implants.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - A Study on the Nature of Association between Demodex Mites and Bacteria Involved  in Skin and Meibomian Gland Lesions of Demodectic Mange in Cattle.
AB  - The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.
TI  - Functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; PL-5, PL-31, PL-32, PL-18, PL-29 and PL-26), alone or in combination, against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and PL-5 against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. Traditional antibiotics and AMPs showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. A strong synergistic effect in the PL-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against Staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of AMPs and traditional antibiotics. The combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
TI  - A microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. METHOD: Included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. The children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental treatments during this trial. The distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. After performing a survey for the education, occupation, and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. The children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine) for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of each week. The 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. RESULTS: The decrease in the DMF-T index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. Of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Enterococcus spp, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Except for Candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. In the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. Moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.
TI  - Cyclic Hexapeptides from the Deep South China Sea-Derived Streptomyces scopuliridis SCSIO ZJ46 Active Against Pathogenic Gram-Positive Bacteria.
AB  - Three new cyclohexapeptides, desotamides B-D (2-4), and the known desotamide (1)  were isolated from marine microbe Streptomyces scopuliridis SCSIO ZJ46. The sequences and absolute configurations of 2-4 were elucidated on the basis of high-resolution spectroscopic data, Marfey's method, and chiral-phase HPLC data. Desotamide C (3) contains a unique N-formyl-kynurenine residue, whereas 4 lacks formylation at the same site. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed notable antibacterial activities against strains of Streptococcus pnuemoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and structure activity relationship studies revealed the indispensability of the Trp component for antibacterial activity within this new scaffold.
TI  - Fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  - Skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. Additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by Gram-negative species. Topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. In such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. However, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of sensitization are not uncommon. As a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. Fusidic acid (FA) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, FA reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that FA, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against S. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corinebatteria, Clostridia. Additionally, FA presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. Such feature makes FA particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. Finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, FA has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. Overall, data on FA efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.
TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Novel copper (II) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  - The incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. In this work, copper (II) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. In the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (II) (Cu(2+)) sulfate solution. In the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding Cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. Alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and Cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low pH provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior. An increase in either Cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption. The hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to the Cu(2+) ion concentration. Blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (II) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. Conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.
TI  - Nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria with different cell-wall properties adhering to surfaces under flow and static conditions.
AB  - Bacteria adhering to surfaces demonstrate random, nanoscopic vibrations around their equilibrium positions. This paper compares vibrational amplitudes of bacteria adhering to glass. Spring constants of the bond are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM-D). Experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. Vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. Under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower in the direction of flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. Under static conditions (0.57 mM), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated Streptococcus salivarius HB7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant HB-C12 (76 nm). Amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) producing Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly EPS producing S. epidermidis ATCC35984 (21 nm). No differences were found between Staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. High vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in QCM-D. In streptococci, the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium is formed by fibrillar surface appendages and spring constants derived from vibrational amplitudes decreased with increasing fibrillar density. In staphylococci, EPS constitutes the main network component, and larger amounts of EPS yielded higher spring constants. Spring constants increased with increasing ionic strength and strains with smaller electrophoretically derived bacterial cell surface softnesses possessed the highest spring constants.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Microbiological isolates and antibiotic sensitivities in culture-proven endophthalmitis: a 15-year review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe the microbiological spectrum and antibiotic sensitivities of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis in Queensland, Australia, and to compare results with similar studies from other parts of Australia and other countries. METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre, non-comparative, consecutive case series. Public hospital microbiology records from culture-positive endophthalmitis cases were reviewed over 15 years from June 1998 to June 2013. Outcome measures were type of endophthalmitis, vitreous isolates cultured and antibiotic sensitivities. RESULTS: 205 cases of culture-proven endophthalmitis were identified with a total of 229 isolates cultured. The most common organisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 23.1%, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 12.7%, Streptococcus viridans group in 10.0%, Candida species in 6.1%, fungal mold species in 5.7%. For gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were vancomycin 100%, cephazolin 79% and penicillin 47%. For gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were ceftazidime 100%, amikacin 100%, ciprofloxacin 100% and gentamicin 95.5%. For fungal isolates, sensitivities were voriconazole 93%, ketoconazole 89%, caspofungin 70% and amphotericin B 58%. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological spectrum and antibiotic sensitivities of endophthalmitis cases in Queensland, Australia, is similar to the spectrum of organisms causing endophthalmitis in other parts of Australia, North America and Europe. Empirical intravitreal vancomycin, ceftazidime and voriconazole are the most appropriate empirical antibiotics for suspected infective endophthalmitis.
TI  - Enzymatic treatment of specimens before DNA extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by DNA amplification techniques (PCR). Moreover the targeted DNA has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. The goal of the present work was to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make DNA available for further extraction and amplification. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase K; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase K. DNAs was manually extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit or the MagNA Pure Compact automate. DNA extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid Herpesvirus. Bacterial detection was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR and yeasts and filamentous Fungi with HRM (real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting analysis). RESULTS: Viral DNA was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. Either the manual or the automatic DNA extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for Fungi and Proteinase K for Bacteria. The addition of lyticase and proteinase K did not improve results. For Fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for Proteinase K, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. DISCUSSION: Columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting DNA and separate PCR inhibitors. Detection rates cannot be related to DNA-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.
TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Preparation of melt-spun antimicrobially modified LDH/polyolefin nanocomposite fibers.
AB  - Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized and organically modified with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and ciprofloxacin. The thermal stability of CSA was improved remarkably under LDH shielding. A minimal inhibitory concentration of free CSA against tested bacteria was determined in order to define the essential quantity in LDH modification. The modified LDHs were melt-compounded with high density polyethylene and the prepared nanocomposites were further melt-spun using a piston-type spinning device. The melt-spun fibers were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CSA integrated fibers show susceptibility against Gram-positive bacteria and ciprofloxacin integrated fibers showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with a substituted thiadiazole moiety as potent drug-resistant bacteria inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thiadiazole moieties were  synthesized via acylation reactions under mild conditions. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by the agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. The majority of the tested compounds displayed moderate antibacterial activities. Importantly, the three compounds with amino or tertiary amine groups in their side chains, 11, 13b, and 15c, were the most active antibacterial agents. Docking experiments carried out on the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA proved that there is a reasonable direct correlation between the binding free energy (DeltaGb, kcal/mol) and the antibacterial activity. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic profiles of 11 and 15c in rat were characterized by moderate clearance and oral bioavailability.
TI  - Phyllanthus wightianus Mull. Arg.: a potential source for natural antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phyllanthus wightianus belongs to Euphorbiaceae family having ethnobotanical importance. The present study deals with validating the antimicrobial potential of solvent leaf extracts of P. wightianus. 11 human bacterial pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens) and 4 fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor racemosus, and Aspergillus niger) were also challenged with solvent leaf extracts usingagar well and disc diffusion methods. Further, identification of the active component present in the bioactive extract was done using GC-MS analysis. Results show that all extracts exhibited broad spectrum (6-29 mm) of antibacterial activity on most of the tested organisms. The results highlight the fact that the well in agar method was more effective than disc diffusion method. Significant antimicrobial activity was detected in methanol extract against S. pneumoniae (29 mm) with MIC and MBC values of 15.62 mug/mL. GC-MS analysis revealed that 29 bioactive constituents were present in methanolic extract of P. wightianus, of which 9,12-octadecaenioic acid (peak area 22.82%; RT-23.97) and N-hexadecanoic acid (peak area 21.55% RT-21.796) are the major compounds. The findings of this study show that P. wightianus extracts may be used as an anti-infective agent in folklore medicine.
TI  - Control of microorganisms of oral health interest with Arctium lappa L. (burdock) extract non-cytotoxic to cell culture of macrophages (RAW 264.7).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Arctium lappa L. extract on Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. In addition, the cytotoxicity of this extract was analyzed on macrophages (RAW 264.7). DESIGN: By broth microdilution method, different concentrations of the extract (250-0.4 mg/mL) were used in order to determine the minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) in planktonic cultures and the most effective concentration was used on biofilms on discs made of acrylic resin. The cytotoxicity A. lappa L. extract MMC was evaluated on RAW 264.7 by MTT assay and the quantification of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha by ELISA. RESULTS: The most effective concentration was 250 mg/mL and also promoted significant reduction (log(1)(0)) in the biofilms of S. aureus (0.438 +/- 0.269), S. epidermidis (0.377 +/- 0.298), S. mutans (0.244 +/- 0.161) and C. albicans (0.746 +/- 0.209). Cell viability was similar to 100%. The production of IL-1beta was similar to the control group (p>0.05) and there was inhibition of TNF-alpha (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A. lappa L. extract was microbicidal for all the evaluated strains in planktonic cultures, microbiostatic for biofilms and not cytotoxic to the macrophages.
TI  - Nosocomial pathogens associated with the mobile phones of healthcare workers in a hospital in Anyigba, Kogi state, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phones of healthcare workers (HCWs) could be colonized by potential bacteria pathogens. The aim of this research is to evaluate the bacterial contamination and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of isolates from mobile phones of HCWs in Grimad hospital. METHOD: A total of 112 swab samples were collected from the mobile phones of HCWs and students in June 2012 in Anyigba. While 56 samples were from HCWs in Grimad hospital, 56 samples were obtained from non-healthcare workers (NHCWs) who served as the control. The samples were all screened for bacterial pathogens by standard bacteriological procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by the disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: The rate of bacterial contamination of mobile phones of HCWs was 94.6%. Bacteria isolated from mobile phones of HCWs were more resistant to antibiotics than NHCWs phones. Staphylococcus Epidermidis (42.9%) was the most frequently isolated bacteria followed by Bacillus spp. (32.1%), Staphylococcus Aureus (25%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (19.6%), Escherichia Coli (14.3%), Streptococcus spp. (14.3%), Proteus spp. (12.5%), Klebsiella spp. (7.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (5.3%). Cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and tetracycline showed high levels of resistance while gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited encouraging results. CONCLUSION: The presence of bacteria pathogens associated with nosocomial infection was identified. Transmission of pathogens can be reduced by hand hygiene and regular cleaning of mobile phones.
TI  - Clinical results of linezolid in arthroplasty and trauma MRSA related infections.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the management of patients treated with linezolid for orthopaedic infections. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with orthopaedic related infections receiving a course of linezolid were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were classified into either post trauma, post arthroplasty and non trauma related infections. A diagnosis of infection was based on clinical findings, positive microbiological specimens, and positive signs of infection on radiological imaging and raised inflammatory markers. Pathogens isolated, inflammatory markers both at presentation and at final follow up, length of linezolid treatment, adverse drug reactions, concomitant anti-microbial therapy, length of hospital stay and any surgical interventions were recorded. RESULTS: Infections were classified as post arthroplasty (n = 10), post trauma surgery (n = 8) or non-trauma related infections (n = 4). Twenty patients (91%) underwent surgical intervention as part of their treatment. The number of required surgical procedures ranged from 1 to 6 (mean = 2.56). Mean total length of stay per admission was 28.5 d (range 1-160 d). Furthermore, the mean duration of treatment with linezolid of patients who had resolution of symptoms was 31 d (range 10-84 d). All patients within this group were discharged on oral linezolid. Pathogens isolated included methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, coliforms, enterococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus and pseudomonas. An overall 77% of patients demonstrated resolution of infections at follow-up, with mean C-reactive protein reducing from 123 mg/L to 13.2 mg/L. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the use of linezolid offers excellent efficacy in orthopaedic related infections when used alongside appropriate surgical management.
TI  - Bacterial resistance of self-assembled surfaces using PPOm-b-PSBMAn zwitterionic  copolymer - concomitant effects of surface topography and surface chemistry on attachment of live bacteria.
AB  - Three well-defined diblock copolymers made of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(SBMA)) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) groups were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method. They were physically adsorbed onto three types of surfaces having different topography, including smooth flat surface, convex surface, and indented surface. Chemical state of surfaces was characterized by XPS while the various topographies were examined by SEM and AFM. Hydrophilicity of surfaces was dependent on both the surface chemistry and the surface topography, suggesting that orientation of copolymer brushes can be tuned in the design of surfaces aimed at resisting bacterial attachment. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli with green fluorescent protein (E. coli GFP) were used in bacterial tests to assess the resistance to bacterial attachment of poly(SBMA)-covered surfaces. Results highlighted a drastic improvement of resistance to bacterial adhesion with the increasing of poly(SBMA) to PPO ratio, as well as an important effect of surface topography. The chemical effect was directly related to the length of the hydrophilic moieties. When longer, more water could be entrapped, leading to improved anti-bacterial properties. The physical effect impacted on the orientation of the copolymer brushes, as well as on the surface contact area available. Convex surfaces as well as indented surfaces wafer presented the best resistance to bacterial adhesion. Indeed, bacterial attachment was more importantly reduced on these surfaces compared with smooth surfaces. It was explained by the non-orthogonal orientation of copolymer brushes, resulting in a more efficient surface coverage of zwitterionic molecules. This work suggests that not only the control of surface chemistry is essential in the preparation of surfaces resisting bacterial attachment, but also the control of surface topography and orientation of antifouling moieties.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - A multifunctional streptococcal collagen-mimetic protein coating prevents bacterial adhesion and promotes osteoid formation on titanium.
AB  - The major barriers to the clinical success of orthopedic and dental implants are  poor integration of fixtures with bone tissue and biomaterial-associated infections. Although multifunctional device coatings have long been considered a promising strategy, their development is hindered by difficulties in integrating biocompatibility, anti-infective activity and antithrombotic properties within a single grafting agent. In this study, we used cell adhesion assays and confocal microscopy of primary murine osteoblasts and human osteoblast cell lines MG-63 and Saos-2 to demonstrate that a streptococcal collagen-like protein engineered to display the alpha1 and alpha2 integrin recognition sequences enhances osteoblast adhesion and spreading on titanium fixtures. By measuring calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity, we also showed that selective activation of alpha2beta1 integrin induces osteoblast differentiation, osteoid formation and mineralization. Moreover, cell adhesion assays and scanning electron microscopy of clinical isolates Staphylococcus aureus Philips and Staphylococcus epidermidis 9491 indicated that streptococcal collagen-mimetic proteins inhibit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation irrespective of their interaction with integrins. Given that streptococcal collagenous substrates neither interact with platelets nor trigger a strong immune response, this novel bioactive coating appears to have desirable multifaceted properties with promising translational applications.
TI  - A safe and practical decontamination method to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of ultrasound transducers.
AB  - PURPOSE: Hospital-acquired infections is a major concern affecting patient management, in which medical instruments and devices play an important role. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of bacterial contamination of the sonographic probe and describe an effective, safe, and practical decontamination method. METHODS: The study's sample consisted of 50 patients. Cultures were taken from the probe surface both after each examination and after the probes had been wiped clean with a dry, nonsterile paper towel. Cultures were also taken randomly from the coupling gel. RESULTS: Initial cultures were positive in 49 cases (98%) for aerobic and in 26 cases (52%) for anaerobic bacteria. Cultures obtained after cleaning the probe were positive in only 21 cases (42%) for aerobic and in 12 cases (24%) for anaerobic bacteria. The most common bacteria isolated in the aerobic cultures were Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and in the anaerobic cultures were Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. All cultures taken from the coupling gel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic probes may act as a medium for bacterial contamination and transmission. Cleaning of the probe with a dry, nonsterile paper towel is an easy, effective, low-cost, and device-friendly method that can reduce this risk.
TI  - Biofilm-infected wounds in a dog.
AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 4-year-old spayed female Mastiff was evaluated for treatment  of chronic nonhealing pressure wounds over both elbow regions resulting from attempts at hypertrophic callus excision. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The wound bed granulation tissue was mottled red and yellow with hyperemic, rolled epithelial edges. The right wound communicated with a large fluid pocket along the thoracic wall. The dog had an inflammatory leukogram with a left shift. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The wounds were debrided, and tissue specimens were collected for histologic evaluation, microbial culture, and bacterial identification by means of molecular diagnostic techniques. The left wound was closed immediately. Calcium alginate rope with silver was packed into the right wound. Vacuum-assisted closure was applied for 6 days. Debridement was repeated, and a thoracodorsal axial pattern flap was used to cover the wound. Systemic treatment with antimicrobials was initiated, and pressure over the elbow regions was relieved. Bacterial biofilms were identified histologically in tissue specimens from both wounds. Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus canis were cultured and identified by 16S rRNA fragment sequencing. Pyrosequencing identified multiple bacterial species and no fungal organisms. Both wounds healed successfully. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biofilms are implicated in infected orthopedic implants in veterinary patients; however, this is the first report of a bacterial biofilm in chronic wounds in a dog. In human wound care, extensive debridement is performed to disrupt the biofilm; a multimodal treatment approach is recommended to delay reformation and help clear the infection. In this case, biofilm reformation was prevented by systemic treatment with antimicrobials, by reducing local pressure on the wounds, and by wound closure.
TI  - Evaluation of the extract of Zeyheria tuberculosa with a view to products for wound healing.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and healing activities of the ethanolic extract of the stems of Z. tuberculosa via topical use and/or oral ingestion. METHOD: antimicrobial assays in vitro using the disk diffusion method, the Artemia salina toxicity test, and in vivo assays with Wistar rats. From these was collected clinical, histological and biochemical data for evaluating the healing process. RESULTS: in vitro antimicrobial testing showed activity in relation to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with zones of inhibition of 18, 14 and 10 mm, respectively. The best minimum inhibitory concentration was 62.5 microg/ml for S. aureus, this bacteria being chosen for the in vitro assays. Animals treated with the ointments with the extract of Z. tuberculosa showed the best results in the reduction of the wound diameter, data confirmed by the presence of re-epithelialization in the histological samples. CONCLUSION: the extract was shown to be promising for the continuation of studies which may identify the active ingredients responsible for the pharmacological activity and its mechanism of action in the process of wound healing, so as to develop a product which may be used as an alternate means in the repair of infected cutaneous wounds.
TI  - gamma-Alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5H)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae Delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. We have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis. In the present Letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus mutans. Our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. In some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/mL (1.3 muM, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/mL (1.3 muM, 3f). Results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Impact of donor arm cleaning with different aseptic solutions for prevention of contamination in blood bags.
AB  - Transfusion associated sepsis cases are encountered occasionally and bacterial transmission remains the major cause. The goal of our study was to compare the efficacy of disinfectants in phlebotomy site preparation. After selection of donor the antecubital fossa area of the arm was disinfected with different types of disinfectants namely sprit (70% isopropyl alcohol), povidone iodine (0.5% w/v available iodine in distilled water), savlon (1.5% v/v chlorhexidine gluconate solution and 3.0% cetrimide solution) and combination of sprit and povidone iodine. Swabs were collected from 20 donors using a sterile forceps, after cleaning with different antiseptic solutions. Swab was streaked on blood agar plate aseptically and the plate was incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Colonies were counted and a single colony was re-cultured by growing on nutrient and Mac-Conkey agar. The biochemical characteristics were determined by performing Gram staining, Motility, Catalase and Oxidase tests. The mean values of colonies were significantly higher with savlon compared to other three solutions. The difference was statistically significant by "t" test (t values 1.7-3.0; P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus were the organisms identified. After completion of bleeding, samples from the bag were aseptically inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles to be tested on BacT/Alert system. The bag containing donor's blood did not show any contamination when three cleanings were carried out using sprit, povidone iodine and spirit respectively.
TI  - Combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. The gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. However, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. We found 3 patients with early-onset PVE cases and blood cultures yielding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of Streptococcus bovis, Candida albicans and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. In 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. After an adequate course of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. CONCLUSION: Our experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological activities of novel pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety.
AB  - Novel pleuromutilin derivatives designed based on the structure of valnemulin were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activities. These pleuromutilin derivatives with substituted amino moiety exhibited excellent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Compound 5b showed the highest antibacterial activities and even exceeded tiamulin. Moreover, the docking experiments provided information about the binding model between the synthesized compounds and peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of 23S rRNA.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - The effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  - AIM: To establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase K with or without ultrasonic activation. METHODOLOGY: Nutrient-stressed biofilms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces radicidentis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecalis OMGS 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. The treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase K, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (with and without ultrasonics). NaOCl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. The biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. RESULTS: Nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium pH became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. The CLSM showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. On the disc model, trypsin and proteinase K were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. NaOCl was the most effective agent (P < 0.001). In the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (P < 0.05). Chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase K (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (P < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/- 4.9). CONCLUSION: Trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.
TI  - Microbiological etiology of bacterial prostatitis in general hospital and primary care clinic in Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health classification of prostatitis reported the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially category II, at 3% to 10%. Because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis technique, chronic prostatitis syndrome (CPS) with a known bacterial origin has increased recently. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis in a general hospital and a primary care clinic (PCC) in addition to the distribution of the microorganism in chronic bacterial prostatitis in Korea. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and five patients in the general hospital and 188 patients in the PCC were enrolled in the study. Using a questionnaire, all patients were checked for symptoms of urinalysis, expressed prostate secretion (EPS), EPS or V3 culture and PCR of EPS or VB3 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genetalia, and Trichomatis vaginalis. RESULTS: In routine EPS or VB3 culture, 12 of 105 patients (11.4%) in the general hospital showed positive culture, but 77 of 188 patients (40.9%) in the PCC showed a positive culture. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas were isolated in routine culture. In the PCR diagnosis, 37 of 105 patients (35.2%) in the general hospital were PCR positive, and 65 of 188 patients (34.5%) in the PCC were PCR positive. In the general hospital, C. trachomatis was the most common (49%), followed by U. urealyticum (24%), M. genetalia (16%), M. hominis (10%), and T. vaginalis (2%). In the PCC, U. urealyticum was the most common (45%), followed by C. trachomatis (34%), M. hominis (13%), M. genetalia (7%) and T. vaginalis (1%). The proportions of chronic bacterial prostatitis were 46.6% (49/105) and 67.5% (127/188) in the general hospital and PCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The total portion of chronic bacterial prostatitis was 59.3% (174/293). Culture-positive patients in the PCC were significantly higher than in the general hospital, but the number of PCR positive patients in the PCC was the same as in the general hospital.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of traditional herbal plants and standard antibiotics against some human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Chloroformic and isoamyl alcohol extracts of Cinnnamomum zylanicum, Cuminum cyminum, Curcuma long Linn, Trachyspermum ammi and selected standard antibiotics were investigated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against six human bacterial pathogens. The antibacterial activity was evaluated and based on the zone of inhibition using agar disc diffusion method. The tested bacterial strains were Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aurues, Serratia marcesnces, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin showed highly significant action against K. pneumonia and S. epidermidis while Ampicillin and Amoxicillin indicated lowest antibacterial activity against tested pathogens. Among the plants chloroform and isoamyl alcohol extracts of C. cyminum, S. aromaticum and C. long Linn had significant effect against P. aeruginosa, S. marcesnces and S. pyogenes. Comparison of antibacterial activity of medicinal herbs and standard antibiotics was also recorded via activity index. Used medicinal plants have various phytochemicals which reasonably justify their use as antibacterial agent.
TI  - Photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based TiO2 nanocomposites after cessation of UV irradiation.
AB  - Photocatalysis induced by TiO2 and UV light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. The present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of UV irradiation. We show that resin-based composites containing 20% TiO2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post UV. For biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct UV illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of Indigofera trita Linn.
AB  - An in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of Indigofera trita L. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. A total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and 2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. Petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), Salmonella paratyphi A (12.80 mm), Streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, S. typhi and Burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). The chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (14.20 mm), S. typhimurium (12.60 mm), S. paratyphi A, S. brunei and Yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). The acetone extract of I. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against S. epidermidis (18.20 mm), S. typhimurium (14.60 mm), S. infantis (13.80 mm), S. aureus (13.40 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and Enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. Ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis (18.60 mm), S. paratyphi A (14.60 mm), Y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), S. typhi (12.40 mm), S. aureus, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium and S. infantis (12.00 mm). Aqueous extract of I. trita considerably inhibited S. epidermidis (13.80 mm), S. paratyphi A and Y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), E. aerogenes and Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). All the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. The result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of I. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.
TI  - Single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis treated with minimally invasive anterior debridement and fusion combined with posterior fixation via Wiltse approach.
AB  - The effect and safety of anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the Wiltse approach were assessed in the single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Seventeen patients from 2007 to 2009 underwent anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the Wiltse approach. Postoperative follow-up time was 24-41 months. Data included the patients' general information, microbiology, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, intervertebral fusion rate, and preoperative and final follow-up scores for American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment, visual analogue scale (VAS), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Ten patients had undergone a prior spinal invasive procedure, and 7 had hematogenous infection. The infected segments included L1-2, L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 in 1, 2, 5, and 9 cases, respectively. Thirteen bacterial cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4), Streptococcus (3), and Escherichia coli (1). The operative time was 213.8+/-45.6 min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 180.6+/-88.1 mL. Postoperative complications consisted of urinary retention (2 cases), constipation (3), and deep vein thrombosis (2). On the final follow-up, VAS scores and ODIs were significantly lower than those of preoperation, while the ASIA grades improved. All the cases achieved good intervertebral bony fusion. Anterior debridement and fusion with a minimally invasive approach combined with posterior fixation via the Wiltse approach can successfully treat single-level lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis, with less trauma and reliable immobilization. It is a viable option for clinical application.
TI  - Synergetic inactivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus mutansin  a TiO2/H2O2/UV system.
AB  - TiO 2 photocatalysis can be used to kill surface adherent bacteria on biomaterials, and is particularly interesting for use with percutaneous implants and devices. Its efficiency and safety, however, depend on the activation energy required. This in vitro study investigates synergetic effects against the clinically relevant strains S. epidermidis and S. mutans when combining photocatalytic surfaces with H2O2. After 20 min exposure to 0.1 wt% H2O2 and UV light on TiO2 surfaces, viabilities of S. epidermidis and S. mutans were reduced by 99.7% and 98.9%, respectively. Without H2O2 the corresponding viability reduction was 86% for S. epidermidis and 65% for S. mutans. This study indicates that low concentrations of H2O2 can enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic TiO2 surfaces, which could potentially improve current techniques used for decontamination and debridement of TiO2 coated biomedical implants and devices.
TI  - A distinguishable role of eDNA in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  - Bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. Biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. Next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. A Maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. Maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. Relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). Principal-component analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. The fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. An intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other EPSs, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact eDNA, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of EPS constituents. This implies that eDNA modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. IMPORTANCE: The protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. Mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. Maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. Here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other EPSs control a second, slower relaxation. Extracellular DNA, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other EPSs.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of 2% lidocaine and reduced rate of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the application of subconjunctival 2% lidocaine/0.1% methylparaben for anesthesia may reduce rates of endophthalmitis after intravitreal (IVT) injection. METHODS: We performed in vitro experiments to determine the antibacterial properties of 2% lidocaine/0.1% methylparaben (lidocaine) against causative organisms of endophthalmitis. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus viridans from patients with endophthalmitis were incubated with or without lidocaine. Aliquots (100 microL) were plated on Mueller-Hinton (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) or blood agar plates (S. viridans) at 0, 10, 30, 120, and 240 minutes, and colonies were counted after 24 hours. A retrospective review of 15,042 IVT injections was performed from January 2004 to February 2011 to determine the rate of endophthalmitis with or without application of subconjunctival lidocaine for anesthesia. RESULTS: Lidocaine demonstrated rapid bactericidal effects against all 3 organisms. After 10 minutes of exposure, there was approximately a 90% (P < 0.01), 95% (P < 0.001), and 92% (P < 0.001) reduction in colony forming units when compared with time 0 for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. viridans, respectively. Complete elimination of colony forming units occurred at subsequent time points for each organism in contrast to logarithmic increase for control plates. There were a total of 0 cases of endophthalmitis of 6,853 IVT injections performed with subconjunctival lidocaine and 8 cases of endophthalmitis of 8,189 (0.1%) IVT injections performed with other methods of anesthesia (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Application of subconjunctival 2% lidocaine/0.1% methylparaben for anesthesia may reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis after IVT injection.
TI  - New non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  - Hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. World health organization (WHO) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. In this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. The new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (CS) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MR S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant S. epidermidis (MDR S. epidermidis), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and three clinical isolates: MR S. aureus, MDR S. epidermidis, and an E. coli strain. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices were evaluated. Ethanol 70% V/V, isopropanol 60% V/V, and 4% w/V chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. Copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: The MIC and MBC for CS ranged from 781 mg/l against S. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against E. coli strains and C. albicans. In addition, PCA exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. The combination of CS and PCA showed a strong synergistic effect and all FIC indices were </=0.500. The combination of CS and PCA were more effective than ethanol 70% V/V and isopropanol 60% V/V. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. This work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - The bacterial adhesion on and the cytotoxicity of various dental cements used for implant-supported fixed restorations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial adhesion on and cytotoxicity of eight luting agents used for implant-supported restorations were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Surface roughness (Ra), surface free energy (SFE) values and three-dimensional images by atomic-force microscopy of circular specimens were determined. Bacterial suspensions of Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus epidermidis were incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 h. Adhering bacteria were examined with fluorescence dye CytoX-Violet, stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and visualized by fluorescence-microscopy. Cytotoxicity-testing was done with WST-1-tests (water soluble tetrazolium). No significant differences, neither with regard to Ra nor regarding SFE were determined. RESULTS: Adherence of S. sanguinis was less on titanium, TempBondNE and TempBond. TempBond, TempBondNE, RelyX Unicem and Implantlink Semi Classic presented low amounts of S. epidermidis. WST-testing showed high cytotoxic potential of Harvard, Aqualox, TempBondNE and TempBond. No combination of low adherent bacteria with low cytotoxicity was found. CONCLUSION: From a biological in-vitro perspective, none of the cements may be recommended for implant-supported restorations.
TI  - Spectrum of bacterial keratitis at a tertiary eye care centre in India.
AB  - AIM: To report the aetiological spectrum and susceptibility patterns of bacteria  isolated from patients with corneal ulceration. METHOD: The microbiological data of all patients with suspected infectious corneal ulceration who presented to the ocular microbiology service at this centre between 2005 and 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULT: Microorganisms were recovered from 1665 (77%) of the 2170 ulcers. Bacterial isolates accounted for 1205 of the organisms isolated. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were various species of Staphylococcus, representing 777 (64.5%), followed by Staphylococcus spp. (148; 12.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (117; 9.7%). High percentages of Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to gatifloxacin (>94%), followed by ofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Almost 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sixty-two (44%) of 140 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 79 (14.8%) of 534 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 33 (14%) of 234 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to three or more antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus spp. were the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with keratitis in this setting. High percentages of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively. Interestingly, a high percentage of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be resistant to three or more antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in Ganzi autonomous prefecture.
AB  - AIM: To compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of Tibetan, Yi and Han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. METHODS: The test subjects were selected from 2 Tibetan, 2 Yi and 3 Han populated places, respectively. Total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P>0.05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. The incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in Tibetan population was significantly lower than that of Han and Yi population. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of Tibetan, Yi and Han people. All of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of Candida-associated stomatitis.
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the short-term efficacy and safety of probiotics as an aid in the treatment of Candida-associated stomatitis in a randomised controlled trial. A total of 65 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral local antifungal agents alone (gargle 2% sodium bicarbonate solution for 30 s, wait 10 min and then apply 2% nystatin paste) or these agents plus local probiotics (the mixture of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) three times per day for 4 weeks. Parameters related to hyperaemia, visual analogue scale scores, culture of resting saliva and a lingual dorsum swab and adverse reactions were assessed or recorded in the beginning, middle and end of treatment. Although the baseline characteristics of the participants were similar, both groups showed a significant reduction in pain level and hyperaemia on the tongue mucosa (P = 0.000) after 4-week application. However, despite the reduction in hyperaemia in the probiotic group, these improvements did not display statistically significant differences. The detection rate of Candida spp. was 100% before treatment and 8.21% in the experimental group and 34.6% in the control group after treatment. The detection rate of Candida spp. decreased (P = 0.000) in both groups and was significantly lower in the probiotic group than the control group (P = 0.038). Other analysed micro-organisms, including the decreased detection rate for Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.049) and the increased detection rate for Staphylococcus epidermidis (P = 0.019), did not display consistent change trends in the probiotics group. Compared with conventional antifungal therapies for oral candidiasis, the inclusion of locally administered probiotics helped improve certain clinical conditions and reduced the prevalence of Candida spp., although the impact of probiotics on oral bacterial species remains to be further studied.
TI  - Cytotoxicity of Brazilian plant extracts against oral microorganisms of interest  to dentistry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emergence of strains resistant to conventional antibiotics,  it is important to carry studies using alternative methods to control these microorganisms causing important infections, such as the use of products of plant origin that has demonstrated effective antimicrobial activity besides biocompatibility. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts of Equisetum arvense L., Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Punica granatum L. and Stryphnodendron barbatimam Mart. against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata, and to analyze the cytotoxicity of these extracts in cultured murine macrophages (RAW 264.7). METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of plant extracts was evaluated by microdilution method based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), M7-A6 and M27-A2 standards. The cytotoxicity of concentrations that eliminated the microorganisms was evaluated by MTT colorimetric method and by quantification of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) using ELISA. RESULTS: In determining the minimum microbicidal concentration, E. arvense L., P. granatum L., and S. barbatimam Mart. extracts at a concentration of 50 mg/mL and G. glabra L. extract at a concentration of 100 mg/mL, were effective against all microorganisms tested. Regarding cell viability, values were 48% for E. arvense L., 76% for P. granatum L, 86% for S. barbatimam Mart. and 79% for G. glabra L. at the same concentrations. About cytokine production after stimulation with the most effective concentrations of the extracts, there was a significant increase of IL-1beta in macrophage cultures treated with S. barbatimam Mart. (3.98 pg/mL) and P. granatum L. (7.72 pg/mL) compared to control (2.20 pg/mL) and a significant decrease of TNF-alpha was observed in cultures treated with G. glabra L. (4.92 pg/mL), S. barbatimam Mart. (0.85 pg/mL), E. arvense L. (0.83 pg/mL), and P. granatum L. (0.00 pg/mL) when compared to control (41.96 pg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: All plant extracts were effective against the microorganisms tested. The G. glabra L. extract exhibited least cytotoxicity and the E. arvense L. extract was the most cytotoxic.
TI  - Peritonitis due to uncommon gram-positive pathogens in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Peritonitis is still the main complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in children. Staphylococcus, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, are the predominant species isolated, followed by Streptococcus spp. and by far by gram-negative bacteria and fungi. We describe three cases of PD-related peritonitis in pediatric patients due to uncommon gram-positive pathogens, which were treated with intraperitoneal antibiotic agents.
TI  - [Application of pyrosequencing in detection of common pathogens in sepsis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply pyrosequencing technique in the detection of the common pathogens in sepsis. METHODS: The primers for amplification and sequencing in pyrosequencing were designed according to alignment of the bacterial 16S rRNA sequence. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted for pyrosequencing, and the pathogen species were determined according to the sequencing data obtained. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing effectively yielded the sequencing data of the 28 bp sequences of the pathogens and clearly distinguished the pathogen species of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Neisseria meningitides, and Salmonella, but failed to distinguish Staphylococcus epidermidis from Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing technique can effectively distinguish the common pathogens in sepsis at the species level.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of plant-derived diterpenes against bovine mastitis bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antibacterial activity of three diterpenes isolated from natural sources against a panel of microorganisms responsible for bovine mastitis. ent-Copalic acid (CA) was the most active metabolite, with promising MIC values (from 1.56 to 6.25 microg mL-1) against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC and clinical isolate), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. We conducted time-kill assays of CA against S. aureus, a commensal organism considered to be a ubiquitous etiological agent of bovine mastitis in dairy farms worldwide. In the first 12 h, CA only inhibited the growth of the inoculums (bacteriostatic effect), but its bactericidal effect was clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). In conclusion, CA should be considered for the control of several Gram-positive bacteria related to bovine mastitis.
TI  - Combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. Synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro in minimal media. Pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular CoA depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. In spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. In the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. To address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. We found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like N5-Pan and N7-Pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. These results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The performance of 4 different supplements and 5 blood culture bottles types in detection of bacteria and Candida spp. in simulated sterile body fluid cultures.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the performance of 4 supplements: horse blood, fastidious organisms supplement (FOS), haemin isovitalex albumine (HIA), and brain heart infusion-haemin isovitalex albumine (BHI-HIA) and 5 blood culture bottles: Bactec Mycosis IC/F, Plus Aerobic/F, Peds Plus/F from the Bactec 9240 system, and BacT/Alert FA and BacT/Alert PF from the BacT/Alert 3D system, in detection of bacteria and Candida spp. in simulated sterile body fluids other than blood models. In total, 8 reference strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, and Candida parapsilosis) and 11 clinical bacteria and yeast isolates (6 isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and 5 isolates from blood) were included in this study. Horse blood, FOS, and HIA were significantly better than no supplements (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0002, and P = 0.05, respectively) in detection of bacteria. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between BHI-HIA and bottles without any supplements. Sixty bottles analyzed of which 59 (98.33%) bottles with horse blood, 53 (88.33%) with FOS, 45 (75.00%) with HIA, and 43 (71.67%) with BHI-HIA signaled positive. The positivity rates with horse blood were significantly higher than with HIA and BHI-HIA (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Similarly, the blood culture bottles with horse blood had shorter time to detection (TTD) compared to bottles with FOS and HIA (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). When yeasts were analyzed, almost all (124/125) blood culture bottles with Candida spp. signaled positive even in the absence of supplements. Bactec Mycosis IC/F had significantly shorter TTD compared to Bactec Peds Plus/F, Bactec Plus Aerobic/F, BacT/Alert FA, and BacT/Alert PF bottles in detection of Candida spp. (P < 0.005, P < 0.05, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). The present study showed that horse blood was the most effective supplement in growth of bacteria in the blood culture bottles that were analyzed in the study.
TI  - Duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. This disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of CD. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of CD patients and control children. Duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, Wilkins-Chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, Casitone, and fatty acid agar. The isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active CD patients, followed by nonactive CD patients and control individuals. Members of the phylum Proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active CD than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum Firmicutes were less abundant. Members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, particularly the species Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. In contrast, members of the family Streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active CD than in controls. Furthermore, isolates of the Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both CD patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. The findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Bacteria in the nose of young adults during wellness and rhinovirus colds: detection by culture and microarray methods in 100 nasal lavage specimens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with viral respiratory infections/viral rhinitis/common colds are often treated with antibiotic; however, there is little information on whether or how bacterial microbiota in the nose and nasopharynx might influence the course of viral illnesses. METHODS: To initiate investigation of possible interaction between viral respiratory illness and microbiota of the nose/nasopharynx, we used microarray technology to examine 100 nasal lavage fluid (NLF) samples for bacterial species and recorded the bacterial titer of culturable bacteria. Rhinovirus illnesses were induced by self-inoculation using the "finger to nose or eye natural transmission route" in 10 otherwise healthy young adults. NLF samples were collected during wellness and at specific time points following experimental rhinovirus inoculation. RESULTS: The rhinovirus infection rate was 70%. There were no consistent changes in the prevalence of different bacterial species determined by microarray and bacterial titer by culture methods during rhinovirus infection. The bacterial profile in NLF samples showed high variability between volunteers but low variability in multiple NLFs obtained before and following infection from the same volunteer. Streptococcus epidermidis/coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) were identified in all 10 subjects. One or more bacterial sinus/otitis pathogens were identified by microarray in 6 of the 10 volunteers. The microarray identified a few bacteria not included in traditional bacterial cultures. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study showed that each of the 10 volunteers had a unique bacterial profile in the nose by microarray analysis and that bacterial load did not change during experimental rhinovirus colds. Larger scale studies are warranted.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - Oral microflora and their relation to risk factors in HIV+ patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of oral microflora and association of oral candidiasis and multiple risk factors in HIV(+) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study included 100 HIV-infected patients participated in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran for Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and HIV. We assessed the presence or absence of OPC, and samples were obtained from the oral cavity and direct microscopic examination, gram staining and culture on standard microbiological media were performed in all patients. CD4(+) cell count/CD4(+) percentage were also calculated. RESULTS: The demographic characteristics showed that the patients had a mean age of 32.3 years old, 78% male and 22% female. Patients belonging to 'O(+)' blood group (27%) were more prone to develop OPC. A total of 460 bacterial colonies were obtained and Streptococcus mutans (15.4%) was the most frequently isolated species in the HIV(+) patients, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.8%) and Corynebacterium (8.7%). In addition, 254 yeasts (from four different genera) were isolated from the patient under study. Candida species (94.4%) were the most frequently obtained genera, followed by Saccharomyces (2.4%), Kluyveromyces and Cryptococcus (1.6% for both) species. Candida albicans (37.2%) was the most common species isolated from HIV(+) patients with OPC and its frequency was significantly higher than that of other Candida species (P<0.05). Candida glabrata, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii and C. norvegensis were also identified. Forty percent of the patients had angular cheilitis as the most frequent clinical variant. The mean CD4(+) cell counts were 154.5 cells/muL, with a range of 8 to 611 cells/muL. Thirty percent patients had a CD4(+) cell count between 101 and 200 cells/muL (28.7% of total yeasts isolated). Yeast and bacteria counts did not differ statistically among HIV(+) patients' subgroups with different levels of CD4(+) cells counts. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that yeasts of the genus Candida were isolated at a comparable rate from the oral cavity of HIV(+) patients and there was no significant difference of the variables CD4(+) cell count and yeast counts. The findings of this study would be helpful in any further study, which, if done prospectively on a large cohort, can be confirmatory.
TI  - Clinical experience with the surgicel family of absorbable hemostats (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in neurosurgical applications: a review.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oxidized regenerated cellulose has a long history of safe and effective use in the surgical setting. Surgicel Original, Fibrillar and Nu-Knit absorbable hemostats are composed of oxidized regenerated cellulose and are sterile, absorbable knitted fabrics that are flexible and adhere readily to bleeding surfaces. The purpose of this paper is to discuss neurosurgical applications for these absorbable hemostatic agents. METHODS: The authors reviewed the literature and described their clinical experience with Surgicel hemostatic products. RESULTS: Neurosurgical applications of the hemostatic products include the management of diffuse capillary oozing following bipolar cautery in brain tumor resection beds and the control of epidural oozing during spinal surgery. As an adjunct to standard hemostatic procedures, these products facilitate rapid hemostasis and have bactericidal activity that extend to antibiotic-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumonia, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although generally safe and well-tolerated, these hemostatic agents should be removed when used around, in, or in proximity to, foramina in bone, areas of bony confine, the spinal cord, and/or the optic nerve or chiasm because it may otherwise swell and cause unwanted pressure. CONCLUSION: The physical, hemostatic, and bactericidal characteristics of this material makes it a useful adjunct for conventional hemostatic and controlling capillary, venous, and small arterial hemorrhage during neurosurgery. .
TI  - Streptococcus sanguinis isolate displaying a phenotype with cross-resistance to several rRNA-targeting agents.
AB  - This study describes a clinical case of a 71-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and a rare linezolid-resistant Streptococcus sanguinis strain (MIC, 32 mug/ml). The patient received courses of several antimicrobial agents, including linezolid for 79 days. The S. sanguinis strain had mutations in the 23S rRNA (T2211C, T2406C, G2576T, C2610T) and an amino acid substitution (N56D) in L22 and exhibited cross-resistance to ribosome-targeting agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Biochemical Activities of Iranian Cymbopogon olivieri (Boiss) Bor. Essential Oil.
AB  - Cymbopogon olivieri essential oil from aerial parts was analyzed by gas chromotography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and led to the identification of 38 compounds. Piperitone (72.8%), 4-carene (11.8%) and beta-himachalene (7.6%) were found as the major components of the oil. The antimicrobial activity was achieved using disc-diffusion and microbroth dilution assays and microbicidal kinetics of oil was screened against different microorganisms. The possible antioxidant activity of oil was evaluated by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free-radical scavenging system. The oil had excellent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil exhibited inhibitory effect against Bacillus subtilis and fungi. Dvalues of oil were 12.5, 10 and 2.4 min for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, respectively. The IC50 value of Cymbopogon olivieri oil was 35 mg/ml and its antioxidant activity was lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. Cymbopogon olivieri oil possesses compounds with antimicrobial properties that can be used as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens from the cerebrospinal fluid of 116 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with bacterial meningitis (BM) and to provide a basis for the timely and effective treatment of childhood BM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on pathogens isolated from 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children in Kunming Children's Hospital between January 2008 and June 2012, as well as drug sensitivity test results. Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing was used to analyze the sensitivity of these pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 116 pathogen strains were detected from the 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 77 (66.4%) Gram-positive strains, 30 (25.9%) Gram-negative strains, and 9 (7.8%) fungal strains, with a positive rate of 2.28%. The six most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 strains, 27.6%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains, 12.9%), Escherichia coli (15 strains, 12.9%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (9 strains, 7.8%), Cryptococcus neoformans (8 strains, 6.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 5.2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in neonates and young infants with BM, and its sensitivity rates to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were lower than 40%. Streptococcus pneumoniae had a penicillin sensitivity rate of 13.4%, while sensitivity rates to erythromycin and clindamycin reached 60.0%. No Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. Gram-negative bacilli had relatively high sensitivity rates to imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens for childhood BM over the past five years. The detected pathogens develop high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. To prevent misdiagnosis, careful attention should be paid to BM caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.
TI  - Evaluation of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. The detection of resistance genes (mecA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and vanA or vanB in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) by the BC-GP assay also was assessed. A total of 186 positive blood cultures (in BacT/Alert FA bottles) with Gram-positive cocci observed with Gram staining were analyzed using the BC-GP assay. The BC-GP results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. Discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat BC-GP testing. The initial BC-GP organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. Only 40% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. The detection of the mecA gene for 69 blood cultures with only S. aureus or S. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. For 3 of 6 cultures with multiple Staphylococcus spp., mecA detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than S. aureus or S. epidermidis. The detection of vanA agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with E. faecalis or E. faecium. Comparison of the mean times to results for each organism group showed that BC-GP results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - Effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  - In many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. A longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of CNS and a recently described CNS-species, Staphylococcus rostri, in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. Twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. The CNS (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing IMI, followed by Corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and Streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than Stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). Thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be Staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer DNA-intergenic spacer-PCR and rpoB-gene sequencing because they were coagulase-negative. Thirty-three of those isolates were identified as Staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis. None of the Staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. Mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qSCC) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/mL. The qSCC at sampling of quarters infected with Staph. rostri (34,466 cells/mL) and CNS other than Staph. rostri (34,813 cells/mL) were significantly higher than the qSCC of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/mL), yet not significantly different from each other. These findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of Staph. rostri compared with other CNS species causing IMI in water buffaloes. Further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of Staph. rostri, as well as other CNS in water buffaloes.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic susceptibilities: a 10-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobial agents over 10 years. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all cases with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution from 2002 through 2011. The outcome measures included all intravitreal isolates identified as well as antibiotic susceptibilities. RESULTS: A total of 448 organisms were isolated during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 30.1% (135/448), Streptococcus viridians group in 10.9% (49/448), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.8% (35/448), Candida albicans in 5.8% (26/443), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6.0% (27/448), Propionibacterium acnes in 4.7% (21/448), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3.1% (14/448). Overall, 327 (72.9%) of 448 isolates were gram-positive organisms, 48 (10.7%) of 448 isolates were gram-negative organisms, 71 (15.8%) of 448 isolates were fungi, and 2 (0.4%) of 448 isolates were viruses. For gram-positive organisms, susceptibilities were the following: vancomycin, 100%; gentamicin, 88.0%; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 77.5%; levofloxacin, 58.5%; oxacillin, 54.7%; ciprofloxacin, 51.0%; gatifloxacin, 51.0%; and moxifloxacin, 47.0%. For gram-negative organisms, susceptibilities were the following: ceftazidime, 100%; levofloxacin, 100%; ciprofloxacin, 95.0%; tobramycin, 90.6%; gentamicin, 80.6%; and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 59.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy generally is the recommendation as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may guide the use of initial antifungal agents.
TI  - Polymicrobial endophthalmitis: prevalence, causative organisms, and visual outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence, causative organisms, and visual acuity outcome in patients with culture-proven polymicrobial endophthalmitis. The method used in this study is the non-comparative, consecutive case series using a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with polymicrobial endophthalmitis for the period 2000 to 2010. RESULTS: Polymicrobial endophthalmitis was identified in 43/1,107 (3.88%) patients. Forty-two patients had two isolates, and one patient had grown three isolates, yielding a total of 87 isolates. Gram-positive cocci were the most common isolate (n = 53; 60.9%) including Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 14/53; 16.1%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 13/53; 13.8%). The etiologies included posttraumatic (n = 31/43; 72.1%) and postoperative (n = 9/43; 20.9%) endophthalmitis. Antibiotic susceptibilities among Gram-positive bacteria were vancomycin (100%) and chloramphenicol (96%). Susceptibilities among Gram-negative bacteria were ciprofloxacin (86.4%) and ofloxacin (81.2%). A maximum number of secondary interventions were done in traumatic cases (38.7%) and cases having coinfection with Gram-negative bacteria and fungus (66.7%). Visual acuity (VA) < 20/200 was more frequently observed in posttraumatic cases (n = 27/31; 87.1%) as compared with postoperative cases (n = 4/9; 44.4%). Of the 43 patients, only 9 patients (20.9%) achieved a VA >/= 20/200 on final follow-up. Four out of twelve patients (33.3%), with fungus as one of the isolates, had a VA >/= 20/200. CONCLUSIONS: Although polymicrobial infection in endophthalmitis is uncommon, it is generally associated with poor visual acuity outcomes especially in eyes with open-globe injuries. Coinfection with Gram-negative bacteria or fungi was associated with most unfavorable visual outcome.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel pleuromutilin derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel pleuromutilin derivatives possessing thioether moiety has been  synthesized via acylation reaction under mild conditions. Their in vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae were tested by agar dilution method and Oxford cup assay. Among the 17 compounds screened, 14-O-[(4-methoxybenzamide-2- methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 4i, 14-O-[(2-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5a and 14-O-[(4-aminobenzamide-2-methylpropane-2-yl) thioacetate] mutilin 5c were resulted as most active antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibiotic selection for the treatment of infectious complications of implant-based breast reconstruction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection requiring explantation remains the most devastating complication associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. There are many treatment algorithms to prevent reconstructive failure in face of infection using both oral and intravenous antibiotics. In the absence of patient-specific culture data, antibiotic selection is generally directed toward broad-spectrum coverage based on historical data. We hypothesize that reviewing our institution's microbiology data obtained from explanted implant-based breast reconstructions would provide a rational basis for antibiotic selection in the future. METHODS: A retrospective review of 902 consecutive immediate implant-based breast reconstructions at a single institution from November 2007 to May 2011 was conducted. Implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology were identified. Patient demographics, implant characteristics, presence of skin necrosis, microbiological data, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-three (4.76%) implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology met the inclusion criteria for this study. Five patients (11.6%) had round, smooth silicone implants, and 36 (88.4%) had textured tissue expanders. Twenty-six implants were explanted because of infection; 3, because of exposure from skin necrosis; and 11, because of the combination of flap necrosis and infection; and 1, secondarily because of cancer invasion into the skin. Reconstruction was salvaged in 21 breasts (51.2%): 12 (57.1%) by implant reconstruction, 5 (23.8%) by pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps, and 4 (19.1%) with a microvascular free flap. Thirty explants had microbiology data available. The most common organism isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis (10), followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (5), Serratia marcescens (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), enterococcus (3), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter (2), group B streptococcus (1), and Morganella morganii (1). Forty percent of the organisms were resistant to cefazolin; however, 86% were sensitive to gentamicin, 80% were sensitive to Levaquin, and 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Infection associated with implant-based breast reconstructions continues to threaten explantation and reconstructive failure. Based on our microbiological data, initial cellulitis amenable to oral antibiotics should be treated with oral fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment. If this regimen fails, intravenous imipenem or gentamicin and vancomycin should be initiated. Obviously, clinical judgment regarding specific patient risk factors and compliance should play a role in decision making, but these data provide an evidence-based rationale for first-line oral antibiotic selection.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Verigene(R) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. A key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. However, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. During the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of BSIs and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. This review focuses on the properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the Verigene((R)) Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria associated with BSIs, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp., and Enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (mecA, vanA, and vanB). Based on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between BC-GP test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree of agreement for identification of mecA-mediated meticillin resistance in S. aureus and S. epidermidis organisms and vanA- or vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium organisms.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Gene identification and recombinant protein of a lysozyme from freshwater mussel  Cristaria plicata.
AB  - Lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. A new LYZ1 from the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and nested PCR method. The full-length cDNA sequence of CpLYZ1 was 763 bp. The cDNA contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 21 bp, a 3'- terminal UTR of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(A) tail, a tailing signal (AATAAA) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. The CpLYZ1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with LYZs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. The mRNA transcript of CpLYZ1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression levels of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The expression level of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. Furthermore, the recombinant CpLYZ1 was induced to be expressed as an inclusion body form by IPTG at 37 degrees C for 4 h, and then was purified by using the Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. The relative enzyme activity of the recombinant CpLYZ1 was influenced on pH and temperature. The optimal pH and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Against Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant CpLYZ1 had bacteriolytic activity.
TI  - Identification of the hydroxyapatite-binding domain of salivary agglutinin.
AB  - The salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (SAG) is present in saliva but is also part  of the salivary pellicle, playing a seemingly paradoxical role with regard to bacterial homeostasis. On the one hand, SAG aggregates bacteria in solution, thereby preventing bacterial colonization. On the other hand, when bound to the tooth surface, SAG facilitates bacterial colonization and microbial growth. The protein part of SAG is predominantly composed of conserved scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains. Previously it was found that bacterial binding and aggregation is mediated via a single peptide loop, designated SRCRP2 (P2), within the SRCR domains of SAG. The current data suggest that the SRCR domains also harbour a hydroxyapatite (HA)-binding moiety, SRCRP3 (P3). The observation that P2 and P3 individually play unique roles in the function of SAGs contributes to our understanding of the dual role of SAGs in bacterial binding. Inspired by the bacterial-modulating capacity of SAGs, we created a P3-polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugate. It was found that a P3 coating resulted in an increased antifouling activity of 20% compared with the uncoated surface in vitro. An additional PEG moiety resulted in an antifouling activity of up to 40% and 30% for Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively.
TI  - [Vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis that were treated in Peking Union Hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. Twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. Pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. Hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. Severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. The fundus could not be observed in all 20 eyes. B-Scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. At the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and Gram stained. To eyes that showed a positive result in Gram staining, 1 mg of Vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (balanced salt solution, BSS) in the eyes. To eyes that showed a negative result in Gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of Ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (BSS) in the eyes, respectively. Additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. The antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. The follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). RESULTS: Thirteen eyes presented with a positive Gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. Bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. The detection rate of pathogen was 75%. The result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. The bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and Bacillus spp in 2 eyes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Loffi Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. The remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. The intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. The visual acuity was significantly elevated. Postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 3 eyes and LP in 1 eye. The retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. We obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by Gram staining. It is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.
TI  - Periodontal status and bacteremia with oral viridans streptococci and coagulase negative staphylococci in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients: a prospective observational study.
AB  - AIM: This study was aimed to investigate whether any association could be found between the presence of an inflamed and infected periodontium (e.g., gingivitis and periodontitis) and the development of bacteremia during neutropenia following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent a periodontal examination before HSCT. Patients were classified as periodontally healthy [all periodontal pocket depths (PPD) </= 4 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) </= 10%) or as having gingivitis/periodontitis (PPD >/= 4 mm and BOP > 10%]. Oral mucositis (OM) was scored using the daily mucositis score. Blood cultures were taken at least twice weekly. RESULTS: Five patients were periodontally healthy, while 13 patients had gingivitis or periodontitis. Twelve patients (67%) developed bacteremia during neutropenia, of which 11 patients (61%) had one or more episodes of bacteremia due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS, most often Staphylococcus epidermidis) or to oral viridans streptococci (OVS), or both. Patients with gingivitis/periodontitis more often had bacteremia than those with a healthy periodontium (p = 0.047), and BOP was associated with bacteremia (p = 0.049). All patients developed ulcerative OM, but its severity and duration were not associated with bacteremia. OM duration and the length of stay in the hospital were strongly correlated (R = 0.835, p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that periodontal infections may contribute to the risk of developing OVS and CONS bacteremia during neutropenia following HSCT. While our results point to the importance of periodontal evaluation and management before HSCT, further studies on periodontal contribution to systemic infectious complications are warranted.
TI  - Organism isolation in corneal ulcer: utility of different techniques.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various techniques are available for isolation of microorganism in  cases of microbial keratitis including conventional methods of scraping, re-scraping inoculation in different media and corneal biopsy. METHODS: This was a cross sectional descriptive study conducted from February 2002 to July 2003. A total of 161 eyes of corneal ulcers were evaluated with scraping inoculation. Re-scraping and corneal biopsy were performed in those cases which did not grow any organism in the first scraping or which did not respond to initial treatment. RESULTS: Microorganisms were isolated in 116 patients (72.04%) after first scraping. S pneumoniae was seen in 50(42%), Fusarium in 21(18%) and Aspergillus in 16(14%) cases. Re-scraping was done in 22 culture negative and non improving cases of which 14 (63.63%) showed isolation of organisms. After re-scraping, Fusarium and Aspergillus were isolated in four patients each (18% each) followed by S. pneumoniae in 3 (14%), S. aureus in 2 (9%), and Penicillium in 1(5%) case. Corneal biopsy was done in 10 cases with isolation of microbial agents in 7 (70%) with Aspergillus and S. aureus in three each, and S. epidermidis in 1(10%). CONCLUSIONS: Apart from conventional scraping, other isolation techniques should be considered in the treatment of non-responding and culture negative cases of corneal ulcers. Compared to bacteria, fungi are difficult to isolate in the first scraping and requires more frequent repeat scraping and corneal biopsy.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - ZAAPS Program results for 2010: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 75 medical centres in 24 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for Gram-positive organisms in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific. For the 2010 Program a total of 6305 Gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: Staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (855), enterococci (787), Streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). Linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. Of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (China, Thailand, Germany, and Brazil). Eight CoNS (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 mug/ml). Two strains from Mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from Italy and Brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. MRSA rates varied by region and between nations, as did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for MRSA therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In summary, the 2010 ZAAPS Program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel modified 5-O-desosamine ketolides.
AB  - A series of novel modified 5-O-desosamine-ketolides were synthesized. The 5-O-desosamine fragment was removed from ketolide by an efficient and mild manipulation. 4-O-substituted desosamine was introduced into the ketolide aglycon and various coupling methods were essayed for the glycosylation. Three novel ketolides were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of susceptible and resistant pathogens. Compound 26 showed potent activity against all the methicillin-sensitivity and resistant pathogens.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Daptomycin concentrations in valve tissue and vegetation in patients with bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - In a patient with mitral-aortic native-valve Streptococcus oralis endocarditis, daptomycin concentrations in aortic and mitral valves were 8.6 and 30.8 mug/g, respectively, and 26 mug/g in the mitral vegetation. In the case of porcine-aortic-valve Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis, the daptomycin concentrations were 53.1 mug/g in the valve and 18.1 mug/g in perivalvular tissues. Daptomycin achieved apparently adequate tissue concentrations. S. epidermidis was eradicated, whereas Streptococcus oralis persisted, and its daptomycin MIC displayed a 4-fold increase.
TI  - Paediatric bacterial keratitis cases in Shanghai: microbiological profile, antibiotic susceptibility and visual outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the microbiological profile, in  vitro antibiotic susceptibility and visual outcomes of paediatric microbial keratitis in Shanghai, China over the past 6 years. METHODS: Medical records of patients aged </=16 years were reviewed, who were diagnosed as having bacterial keratitis between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Bacterial culture results and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility were analysed. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between visual impairment and possible risk factors. RESULTS: Eighty consecutive cases of paediatric bacterial keratitis cases were included, among which 59 were identified as having positive culture. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated organism (n=23; 39.0%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=11; 18.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=6; 10.2%). Antibiotic sensitivities revealed that tested bacteria had low resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (8.3-18.4% and 12.5-24.4%, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis proved that visual impairment was significantly associated with Gram-negative bacterial infection (odds ratio (OR)=7.626; P=0.043) and an increasing number of resistant antibiotics (OR=0.385; P=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: S. epidermidis was the most common isolated organism in Shanghai paediatric keratitis. The fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides remained good choices for treating these patients. Gram-negative bacterial infection and an increasing number of resistant antibiotics were associated with worse visual prognoses in paediatric keratitis.
TI  - Ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 Pasteurella species isolates.
AB  - More than 5 million Americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. Bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is FDA approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs), including those containing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida and Pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other Pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. We therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. MICs were determined using the broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines. Comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP). Ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 Pasteurella species, including P. multocida subsp. multocida and P. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum MIC of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (MIC(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and SMX-TMP (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml). Ceftaroline was also very active against all S. aureus isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, with a maximum MIC of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. Ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving P. multocida, other Pasteurella species, and aerobic Gram-positive isolates, including S. aureus.
TI  - Aerobic vaginitis and mixed infections: comparison of clinical and laboratory findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and mixed infections with AV to achieve efficient diagnosis. METHODS: From April 2008 to August 2009, 657 consecutive outpatients with vaginal symptoms in gynecology clinic in the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University were investigated. Samples were taken for examination of vaginal discharge and fresh wet mount microscopy. AV, bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomonal vaginitis (TV) were diagnosed according to standardized definitions. Sixty patients with single AV were randomly selected over the same period. Each patient accepted moxifloxacin therapy. Two kinds of treatment course (400 mg qd, 6 days or 400 mg qd, 12 days) were given. Clinical features and laboratory test results in the first visit and follow-ups were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULT: Among the 657 cases, AV was found in 23.74 % of the cases (156/657). AV mixed infections were diagnosed in 53.85 % (84/156): the mixed infections included VVC (32/84, 38.10 %), BV (31/84, 36.90 %), and TV (21/84, 25.00 %). Common symptoms of AV were a change in the characteristics of the discharge (44/72, 61.11 %) and increased discharge (30/72, 41.67 %). Vaginal pH was usually higher than 4.5 (63/72, 87.50 %). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated. There is no statistically significant difference between two moxifloxacin treatment groups (p > 0.05). Cure rate was 89.7 % in 6-day group, and 71.4 % in 12-day group. CONCLUSIONS: AV is a common vaginal infection, and it is often mixed with other infections, especially VVC, BV and TV. The symptoms and signs of AV mixed infections are atypical. If a patient has vaginal complaints, it is necessary to determine whether AV or mixed infections are present. Oral moxifloxacin is effective in treating AV, and an appropriate course should be selected taking the severity of AV into consideration.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand.
AB  - The vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand have been suggested as rich sources of beneficial phytochemicals. In this study, vegetables and fruits native to the Northeast region of Thailand were evaluated for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. For vegetables, the extracts of Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr. (extracted by 80% ethanol) and Sauropus androgynus (Linn.) Merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by DPPH scavenging (IC5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively) and FRAP antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and 74.00+/-0.04 mmol FeSO4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of vegetable). For fruits, the extracts derived from Terminalia chebula Retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of DPPH scavenging (IC50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively), FRAP antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol FeSO4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). The antibacterial assays showed that Moringa oleifera Lam., Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr., Terminalia chebula Retz. and Phyllanthus emblica Linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Propionibacterium acnes. The results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to Thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from western European countries in 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western Europe. METHODS: Forty-one centres in Spain (8), Italy (9), Germany (8), France (8) and the UK (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 101 VRE, 193 Streptococcus agalactiae and 191 Streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. These were re-identified and susceptibilities to oritavancin and comparators were determined. RESULTS: Oritavancin was very active against MRSA (MIC(50)/MIC(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/L), MRCoNS (0.06/0.12 mg/L), VRE (0.03/0.06 mg/L), S. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/L). The highest oritavancin MIC observed was 0.25 mg/L (species were S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis). CONCLUSIONS: These data from recently collected Gram-positive bacteria in western Europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant MRSA, MRCoNS and VRE isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of platelets and cases of septic reactions associated with transfusion of contaminated samples.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: For years, platelet transfusion therapy has been playing an important role in controlling patients with hematological and oncological diseases. However, platelet transfusion represents a serious risk for bacterial sepsis. This study aimed to verify the bacterial contamination index in platelet concentrates (PCs) obtained from the Blood Center of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (HEMORGS). METHODS: All 612 samples of PCs from HEMORGS were analyzed in August 2009 and January 2010. We used a qualitative methodology which was modified manually in order to detect bacterial contamination. The patients who received the platelet units with confirmed positive cultures had their medical records analyzed. After the prospective study, a retrospective analysis of the samples of PCs checked by the bacteriological control from HEMORGS since its foundation (2008) until 2010 was made. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty samples (10 monthly samples of plateletpheresis and 10 of whole blood-derived platelets) were analyzed in order to compare the contamination index for both studies. Of 1092 samples, 15 were found to be contaminated (6 of retrospective analysis and 9 of prospective). In prospective study, isolated microorganisms were nine Staphylococcus epidermidis, but in retrospective two Staphylococcus sp., two glucose non-fermenting gram negative bacilli, one Streptococcus sp. and one Proteus mirabilis. We report 3 feasible cases of bacterial sepsis associated with the transfusion of CPs analyzed by prospective study. CONCLUSION: Bacterial sepsis associated with platelet transfusion is today the most frequent infectious complication of transfusion medicine. Although complex, it is important to recognize transfusion sepsis in patients to reduce morbidity and mortality.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Evaluation of silicon oil on bacterial growth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of silicon oil (Oleo de Silicone(R), Ophthalmos, Brazil) on in vitro bacterial growth of different microorganisms related to endophthalmitis. METHODS: The following microorganisms were analyzed: (1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27583); (2) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); (3) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); (4) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228); (5) Candida albicans (ATCC 10231); (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883); and (7) Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 masculineC and its growth examined after 24 hours. An empty disk was placed in the center of each plate as a control. RESULTS: No inhibition halos were verified in any of the plates containing the four different concentrations of the bacterial inocula. CONCLUSIONS: The silicon oil 1000 cps does not have any effect on bacterial growth of any of the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Structural basis for nucleotide binding and reaction catalysis in mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase.
AB  - Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes the final step of the mevalonate pathway, the Mg(2+)-ATP dependent decarboxylation of mevalonate 5-diphosphate (MVAPP), producing isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Synthesis of IPP, an isoprenoid precursor molecule that is a critical intermediate in peptidoglycan and polyisoprenoid biosynthesis, is essential in Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus spp.), and thus the enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are ideal antimicrobial targets. MDD belongs to the GHMP superfamily of metabolite kinases that have been extensively studied for the past 50 years, yet the crystallization of GHMP kinase ternary complexes has proven to be difficult. To further our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of GHMP kinases with the purpose of developing broad spectrum antimicrobial agents that target the substrate and nucleotide binding sites, we report the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant (S192A and D283A) ternary complexes of Staphylococcus epidermidis MDD. Comparison of apo, MVAPP-bound, and ternary complex wild-type MDD provides structural information about the mode of substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Structural characterization of ternary complexes of catalytically deficient MDD S192A and D283A (k(cat) decreased 10(3)- and 10(5)-fold, respectively) provides insight into MDD function. The carboxylate side chain of invariant Asp(283) functions as a catalytic base and is essential for the proper orientation of the MVAPP C3-hydroxyl group within the active site funnel. Several MDD amino acids within the conserved phosphate binding loop ("P-loop") provide key interactions, stabilizing the nucleotide triphosphoryl moiety. The crystal structures presented here provide a useful foundation for structure-based drug design.
TI  - Report: Studies on antibacterial activity of some traditional medicinal plants used in folk medicine.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of eight medicinal plants commonly used in folk medicine were  tested for their antibacterial activity against four Gram positive strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and six Gram negative strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis. Salmonella typhi para A, Salmonella typhi para B and Shigella dysenteriae) that were obtained from different pathological laboratories located in Karachi, Pakistan. Disc diffusion method was used to analyze antibacterial activity. Out of eight, five medicinal plants showed antibacterial activity against two or more than two microbial species. The most effective antimicrobial plant found to be Punica granatum followed by Curcuma zedoaria Rosc, Grewia asiatica L and Carissa carandas L, Curcuma caesia Roxb respectively. From these results, it is evident that medicinal plants could be used as a potential source of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by Gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. Lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. However, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of Gram positive pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. It is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. Here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.
TI  - Microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. Since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. METHODS: A total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the United States with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. Species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards. RESULTS: The most prevalent species was Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, the Streptococcus mitis group, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. One species identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was Dolosigranulum pigrum. Ampicillin resistance was common among H. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among S. pneumoniae, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. The latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, D. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. The topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage for empiric treatment of ocular infections.
TI  - Bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species.
AB  - Human symbiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) in the intestines, Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) in skin and Streptococcus salivalis (SS) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (DH-DG) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), together with mono- to tetrahexaosyl DGs. The molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the DG moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for LR, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for SE, and 16:0 and 18:1 for SS, respectively. The carbohydrate structures of DH-DGs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being Galalpha1-2Glcalpha for LR, Glcbeta1-6Glcbeta for SE, and Glcalpha1-2Glcalpha for SS, respectively. Also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. Anti-L. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl DGs, in which Galalpha was bound to DH-DG through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with DH-DG from LR. Although anti-SE antiserum preferentially reacted with DH-DG from SE, anti-SS antiserum reacted with DH-DG from SS and, to a lesser extent, with DH-DGs from LR and SE. But, both anti-SE and anti-SS antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl DG or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. In addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the ABO blood group, were found to contain IgM to tri- and tetrahexaosyl DGs from LR, but not to DH-DGs from LR, SE and SS.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Mondor's disease affecting the superficial dorsal vein of the penis.
AB  - A case of the thrombophlebitis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis (Mondor's disease of the penis) is reported. Two possible causes have been identified: a urogenital infection and a muscular strain (strength training). The first one was probably the underlying cause, the second one triggered the disease.
TI  - Low nasal carriage of drug-resistant bacteria among medical students in Vienna.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant bacteria are increasing and remain a major public health challenge worldwide. In order to understand the potential role of medical students as a reservoir for circulating pathogenic bacteria and their transmission, we analysed the nasal colonisation among 86 clinically exposed medical students of the Medical University of Vienna, which is integrated into General Hospital of Vienna. METHODS: Nasal swabs obtained from 79 students were eligible for further analysis. Nasal swabs were analysed for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with special emphasis on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: 25.3% of participants were positive for Staphylococcus aureus colonization; none of the isolates showed methicillin-resistance or expression of Pantoin-Valentine-leukocidin. However, 2.5% were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. No participant showed Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation. Furthermore, 10.1% of the samples displayed growth of Gram-negative bacteria, yet none showed any relevant drug-resistance. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our investigation did not reveal any clinically relevant multi-drug resistant bacterial colonisation among clinically exposed medical students in Vienna. This might be explained by well-established hygienic precautions or comparably low circulation of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Childhood microbial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate risk factors for pediatric microbial keratitis and to describe the clinical picture, microbial spectrum, treatment modalities, posttreatment sequelae, and visual outcome in cases with pediatric microbial keratitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of microbial keratitis that occurred in children 16 years or younger who had an initial examination between January 2000 and December 2010 at a tertiary referral eye hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were identified. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted using a computer-based diagnosis code. Demographic data, predisposing factors, clinical course, microbial culture results, and visual outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes were included in this study. Predisposing factors were identified in 63 eyes (92.6%). All patients had unilateral microbial keratitis. The mean+/-SD age was 4.5 +/- 4.8 years and 57.4% were male. Trauma was the leading cause [27 eyes (39.7%)], followed by systemic diseases [14 eyes (20.6%)], contact lens wear [11 eyes (16.1%)], and ocular diseases [11 eyes (16.1%)]. Corneal scraping was performed in all cases. Five patients needed general anesthesia to carry out the corneal scraping. Thirty-four (50.0%) eyes showed positive cultures. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 67.8% and gram-negative bacteria for 38.2% of isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated organism [8 eyes (25.8%)], followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis [7 eyes (22.7%)]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated gram-negative [6 eyes (17.6%)] organism. One eye had corneal perforation and required surgical intervention. Forty-five of 68 eyes (66.2%) had a best-corrected visual acuity evaluation at the last follow-up and 28 eyes (62.2%) of them had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better. CONCLUSION: Children with suspected microbial keratitis require comprehensive evaluation and management. Early recognition, identifying the predisposing factors and etiological microbial organisms, and instituting appropriate treatment measures have a crucial role in outcome. Ocular trauma was the leading cause of childhood microbial keratitis in our study.
TI  - Infection risk from surgeons' eyeglasses.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess bacterial contamination of 20 eyeglasses from surgeons. METHODS: 40 samples were taken from the nose pad (n=20) and earpiece (n=20) of 20 eyeglasses from orthopaedic surgeons using a sterile swab stick soaked in sterile distilled water. Swabs were incubated and inoculated onto 3 plates: Staphylococcus/Streptococcus agar plate, Mannitol salt plate, and Chromogenic agar plate. Organisms isolated were identified. RESULTS: Of 20 eyeglasses, 19 were contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (3 of them additionally grew S haemolyticus or S xylosus) and the remaining one grew S aureus . CONCLUSION: Eyeglasses are a source of surgical infection. Contamination can be caused by direct contact of the eyeglasses to the wound and indirect contact by the surgeon's fingers, splashes from saline irrigation, and through air. Therefore, disinfection should be performed for eyeglasses of surgeons. The use of surgical visor masks or filtered exhaust helmets (space suits) are alternatives.
TI  - Inhibitory and antimicrobial activities of OGTI and HV-BBI peptides, fragments and analogs derived from amphibian skin.
AB  - A series of linear and cyclic fragments and analogs of two peptides (OGTI and HV-BBI) isolated from skin secretions of frogs were synthesized by the solid-phase method. Their inhibitory activity against several serine proteinases: bovine beta-trypsin, bovine alpha-chymotypsin, human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G from human neutrophils, was investigated together with evaluation of their antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive species isolated from patients (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp.). The cytotoxicity of the selected peptides toward an immortal human skin fibroblast cell line was also determined. Three peptides: HV-BBI, its truncated fragment HV-BBI(3-18) and its analog [Phe(8)]HV-BBI can be considered as bifunctional compounds with inhibitory as well as antibacterial properties. OGTI, although it did not display trypsin inhibitory activity as previously reported in the literature, exerted antimicrobial activity toward S. epidermidis. In addition, under our experimental conditions, this peptide did not show cytotoxicity.
TI  - Bacterial flora concurrent with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach of patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the non-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial flora concurrent with H. pylori infection. METHODS: A total of 103 gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori positive patients were selected for bacterial culture. All the non-H. pylori bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: A total of 201 non-H. pylori bacterial isolates were cultivated from 67 (65.0%) of the 103 gastric samples, including 153 isolates identified successfully at species level and 48 at genus level by MALDI-TOF MS. The dominant species were Streptococcus, Neisseria, Rothia and Staphylococcus, which differed from the predominantly acid resistant species reported previously in healthy volunteers. The prevalence of non-H. pylori bacteria was higher in non-ulcer dyspepsia group than in gastric ulcer group (100% vs 42.9%, P < 0.001). Six bacterial species with urease activity (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Brevibacterium spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of the non-H. pylori bacteria concurrent with H. pylori infection, and the non-H. pylori bacteria may also play important as-yet-undiscovered roles in the pathogenesis of stomach disorders.
TI  - Bacterial survival in the radiographic processes.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial contamination in  hand-operated and automatic radiographic solutions and on contact surfaces during radiographic procedures such as X-ray cone and button and surface of hand-operated and automatic radiographic solution tanks in dental clinics. METHODS: A 10 mL liquid solution was taken with syringe at 5, 10, 24, and 48 hour time intervals from freshly prepared hand-operated and automatic processing solution. The swab samples were taken from the surfaces of radiographic solution tanks, X-ray cone and its button. The specimens were inoculated into blood agar and Eosin Methylene-Blue (EMB) agar. The plates were incubated in an incubator for 48 hours at 37 degrees C. Becton Dickinson Phoenix Automated Microbiology System was used for determining the microorganisms. RESULTS: Although the microbiologic analyses of the samples revealed no microbial growth in the hand-operated and automatic radiographic solutions in all observation periods, the microbial growth on the contact surfaces was observed. Staphylococcus epidermidis, metisillin resistant from the surface of radiographic solution tanks, X-ray cone and switch. Streptococcus mitis was found on the X-ray switch. CONCLUSION: Radiographic procedures can cause cross contamination; clinicians should therefore apply disinfection protocols in all radiographic procedures.
TI  - Outbreak of bacterial meningitis among patients undergoing myelography at an outpatient radiology clinic.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate an outbreak of bacterial meningitis at an outpatient radiology clinic (clinic A) and to determine the source and implement measures to prevent additional infections. METHODS: A case was defined as bacterial meningitis in a patient undergoing myelography at clinic A from October 11 to 25, 2010. Patients who underwent myelography and other procedures at clinic A during that period were interviewed, medical records were reviewed, and infection prevention practices were assessed. Case-patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, oral specimens from health care personnel (HCP), and opened iohexol vials were tested for bacteria. Bacterial isolates were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A culture-negative CSF specimen was tested using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: Three cases were identified among 35 clinic A patients who underwent procedures from October 11 to 25, 2010. All case-patients required hospitalization, 2 in an intensive care unit. Case-patients had myelography performed by the same radiology physician assistant and technician on October 25; all patients who underwent myelography on October 25 were affected. HCP did not wear facemasks and reused single-dose iohexol vials for multiple patients. Streptococcus salivarius (a bacteria commonly found in oral flora) was detected in the CSF of 2 case-patients (1 by culture, 1 using real-time polymerase chain reaction) and in HCP oral specimens; 1 opened iohexol vial contained Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles from the case-patient S salivarius and the radiology physician assistant were indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial meningitis likely occurred because HCP performing myelography did not wear facemasks; lapses in injection practices may have contributed to transmission. Targeted education regarding mask use and safe injection practices is needed among radiology HCP.
TI  - The effect of various topical peri-implantitis antiseptics on Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although peri-implantitis has presented an ever increasing problem in  modern dentistry, satisfying therapeutic strategies or scientifically based treatment recommendations are still not available. The main object of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of six different topical antiseptics on three test microorganisms attached to titanium implant specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For biofilm formation, plane titan specimens were incubated either in Candida albicans, Streptococcus sanguinis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis for 2h. The specimens were then treated with different topical antiseptics for 60s (sodium hypochlorite 1.0%, hydrogen peroxide 3.0%, chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2%, citric acid 40.0%, Plax, or Listerine) and with sterile saline as control. Remaining vital fungi were quantified by means of a bioluminometric assay and the bacterial load and the viability of adhering S. epidermidis and S. sanguinis by live or dead cell labelling in combination with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Sodium hypochlorite was effective against all three species, whereas hydrogen peroxide was solely effective against C. albicans. CHX and Listerine showed antimicrobial activity against S. sanguinis and C. albicans and citric acid and Plax against both tested bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: None of the tested antimicrobial agents, except for sodium hypochlorite, showed a significant in vitro effect on all three test microbes. Considering the possible toxicity of sodium hypochlorite, none of the tested - and so far widely used - antiseptics showed any broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect and could therefore not be recommended for the topical disinfection and detoxification of infected implant surfaces.
TI  - Protection against Staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Type 1 lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against LTA have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated Enterococcus faecalis strains. In the present study, we show that antibodies against E. faecalis LTA also bind to type 1 LTA from other gram-positive species and opsonized Staphylocccus epidermidis and Staphylcoccus aureus strains as well as group B streptococci. Inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. Passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against E. faecalis LTA promoted the clearance of bacteremia by E. faecalis and S. epidermidis in mice. Furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine S. aureus peritonitis model. The effectiveness of rabbit antibody against LTA suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.
TI  - A multicentre prospective study of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Study the clinical and microbiological characteristics and the prognostic factors of post-traumatic endophthalmitis. METHODS: Seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. Conventional cultures and panbacterial PCR were performed on aqueous and vitreous samples. RESULTS: Clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1.5 +/- 2.5 days). Laceration with an intraocular foreign body (IOFB) was noted in 53% of the patients. At admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71%) and/or vitreous (53%) samples. Fifteen patients (88%) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. Bacteria were identified in 77% of the cases: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Streptococcus (n = 4), Bacillus (n = 2), Pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and Streptococcus salivarius and Gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). Progression toward phthisis was observed in 35% of the cases; 41% of the patients recuperated visual acuity (VA) >/=20/40. A good final visual prognosis (>/=20/40) was significantly associated with initial VA better than light perception (0% versus 70%, p = 0.01) and absence of pupillary fibrin membrane (80% versus 20%, p = 0.05). There was no correlation between visual prognosis and age, the type of laceration (corneal or scleral) or presence of an IOFB. We found a statistical trend toward an association between bacterial virulence and poor final VA. CONCLUSION: This series showed that better final VA outcomes were associated with initial VA better than light perception, S. epidermidis or culture-negative cases and absence of retinal detachment during the clinical course.
TI  - Temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) has long been associated with Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization or infection and is typically managed with regimens that include antimicrobial therapies. However, the role of microbial communities in the pathogenesis of AD is incompletely characterized. To assess the relationship between skin microbiota and disease progression, 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene sequencing was performed on DNA obtained directly from serial skin sampling of children with AD. The composition of bacterial communities was analyzed during AD disease states to identify characteristics associated with AD flares and improvement post-treatment. We found that microbial community structures at sites of disease predilection were dramatically different in AD patients compared with controls. Microbial diversity during AD flares was dependent on the presence or absence of recent AD treatments, with even intermittent treatment linked to greater bacterial diversity than no recent treatment. Treatment-associated changes in skin bacterial diversity suggest that AD treatments diversify skin bacteria preceding improvements in disease activity. In AD, the proportion of Staphylococcus sequences, particularly S. aureus, was greater during disease flares than at baseline or post-treatment, and correlated with worsened disease severity. Representation of the skin commensal S. epidermidis also significantly increased during flares. Increases in Streptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Corynebacterium species were observed following therapy. These findings reveal linkages between microbial communities and inflammatory diseases such as AD, and demonstrate that as compared with culture-based studies, higher resolution examination of microbiota associated with human disease provides novel insights into global shifts of bacteria relevant to disease progression and treatment.
TI  - Vitreous cultures and antibiotic analysis in Puerto Rican endophthalmitis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze positive vitreous cultures and their respective antibiotic  sensitivities in patients with endophthalmitis in Puerto Rico. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of vitreous cultures from all of the patients with a clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis at the Puerto Rico Medical Service Administration Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from August 2009 to July 2010. Positive isolates were selected for analysis. A retrospective chart review was performed to establish the mechanism involved in the development of endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Forty-three patients underwent vitreous cultures for a diagnosis of endophthalmitis, of which 16 patients had positive cultures. Seventy-eight percent of the isolates were bacterial and 22% fungal. Staphylococcus genus was identified in 38% of patients. All of the Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumonia isolates were resistant to oxacillin; 66% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also resistant to oxacillin. All of the Gram-positive isolates in our study were sensitive to vancomycin. All of the gram-negative isolates were sensitive to ceftazidime. Twenty-nine percent of the post-traumatic endophthalmitis cases were fungal in origin. CONCLUSION: The majority of endophthalmitis cases in our study were bacterial in origin, and the Staphylococcus genus was the most common type of organism identified. In our cohort, post-traumatic endophthalmitis was the most common mechanism leading to infection. Vancomycin in combination with ceftazidime appears to be adequate for the empiric treatment of all cases of bacterial endophthalmitis in our population. Anti-fungal agents should be considered as adjuvant empiric treatment in patients with post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of conformationally restricted mutilin 14-carbamates.
AB  - We report herein the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of conformationally restricted mutilin 14-carbamates based on the structure of SB-222734. The antibacterial activities of these newly synthesized compounds were also evaluated and compared with linezolid and retapamulin. Results showed that most of the target compounds exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria including Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus MSSA (MIC: 0.0625-2mug/mL), Methicillin-resistant S. aureus MRSA (MIC: 0.0625-2mug/mL), Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis MSSE (MIC: 0.0625-2mug/mL), Methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MRSE (MIC: 0.0625-2mug/mL), and Streptococcus pneumonia (MIC: 0.0625-4mug/mL). In particular, three remarkable compounds of this series (12l, 12m, and 21l) exhibited comparable in vitro antibacterial profiles to that of retapamulin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  - Nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and activity of these molecules was outlined. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or N(6)-positions and bearing N-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. The data obtained, MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the N(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive group with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). The intact sugar moiety seemed to be not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in N(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, N-1 proved to be non-crucial and the 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an MIC of 32 mg l(-1) against Staph. aureus and Strep. pneumoniae. None of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. Hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the N(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Bacteremia following dental implant surgery: preliminary results.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the incidence of bacteremia, bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility against to causative bacteria associated with dental implant installation. STUDY DESIGN: 30 generally healthy patients were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 30 minutes after dental implant installation and 24 hours after dental implant surgery. Blood samples were cultured in a BACTEC system. The isolated bacteria were identified using conventional methods. Antimicrobial sensitivity tests were performed by disc diffusion. RESULTS: No bacteria were isolated at the baseline and 24 hours after surgery, whereas the prevalence of bacteremia at 30 minutes after dental implant installation was 23%. The isolated bacteria species were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Eubacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp. and Streptococcus viridans. The Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was isolated in three patients, was found to be resistant to penicillin which is first choice of many clinicians. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that installation of dental implants can produce bacteremia. Within the limitations of this study, it can be speculated that the resistance of antibiotics may compromise the routine prophylaxis against infective endocarditis. Therefore use of blood cultures and antibiograms may be suggested in risky patients. The outcome of the present study should be verified using a larger patient group with varying conditions.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of TD-1792, a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer antibiotic used against Gram-positive bacteria, in a neutropenic murine thigh model.
AB  - TD-1792 is a novel glycopeptide-cephalosporin heterodimer investigational antibiotic that displays potent bactericidal effects against clinically relevant Gram-positive organisms in vitro. The present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of TD-1792 in the neutropenic murine thigh infection animal model. TD-1792, dosed subcutaneously (SC), produced dose-dependent reduction in the thigh bacterial burden of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSA, MRSA, MSSE, MRSE, respectively), penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). In single-dose efficacy studies, the 1-log(10) CFU kill effective dose (ED(1-log kill)) estimates for TD-1792 ranged from 0.049 to 2.55 mg/kg of body weight administered SC, and the bacterial burden was reduced by up to 3 log(10) CFU/g from pretreatment values. Against S. aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), the total 24-h log(10) stasis dose (ED(stasis)) and ED(1-logkill) doses for TD-1792 were 0.53 and 1.11 mg/kg/24 h, respectively, compared to 23.4 and 54.6 mg/kg/24 h for vancomycin, indicating that TD-1762 is 44- to 49-fold more potent than vancomycin. PK-PD analysis of data from single-dose and dose-fractionation studies for MRSA (ATCC 33591) demonstrated that the total-drug 24-h area under the concentration-time curve-to-MIC ratio (AUC/MIC ratio) was the best predictor of efficacy (r(2) = 0.826) compared to total-drug maximum plasma concentration of drug-to-MIC ratio (Cmax/MIC ratio; r(2) = 0.715) and percent time that the total-drug plasma drug concentration remains above the MIC (%Time>MIC; r(2) = 0.749). The magnitudes of the total-drug AUC/MIC ratios associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log(10) CFU reduction from baseline and near maximal effect, were 21.1, 37.2, and 51.8, respectively. PK-PD targets based on such data represent useful inputs for analyses to support dose selection decisions for clinical studies of patients.
TI  - Bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. The purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. Nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. The most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. The most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and Streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). The insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. Every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. Chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. In case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
TI  - A ten-year review of neonatal bloodstream infections in a tertiary private hospital in Kenya.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neonatal mortality in developing countries is usually due to an infectious cause. The gold standard of investigation in developing countries is a positive blood culture. It is important to know the aetiology of neonatal bloodstream infections so that empiric treatment can be effective. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a retrospective clinical audit over ten years between January 2000 until December 2009, looking at the aetiology of both early and late onset neonatal sepsis. We analysed data from 152 (23%) patient isolates out of 662 suspected cases of neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: Our study revealed that Gram-positive organisms were the predominant cause of both early and late onset sepsis; the common isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (34%) and Staphylococcus aureus (27%). There were no isolates of group B Streptococcus. Candida species was isolated only in patients with late onset sepsis (6.9%). Bacterial isolates were relatively sensitive to the commonly used first- and second-line empiric antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive organisms remain the major cause of neonatal bloodstream infections in our setup. The findings of this study will guide clinicians in prescribing the right empiric therapy in cases of suspected neonatal sepsis before the definitive culture results are obtained.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility to different topical ophthalmic antibiotics of bacterial  isolates from patients with conjunctivitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To test in vitro the susceptibility to different commercially-available  topical antibiotics of isolates from patients with conjunctivitis, evaluated at the Microbiology Service of Turin Ophthalmic Hospital between January 2005-February 2007. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were cultured using both liquid and solid media. The four most frequent isolates were analyzed and their in vitro susceptibility to levofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, tobramycin, netilmycin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol was tested, using the Kirby-Bauer diffusion method and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) serum standards. RESULTS: The four most common bacteria isolates were: Staphylococcus aureus (27%), viridians Streptococci (22%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). The in vitro susceptibility to levofloxacin was highest (p<0.01) for all bacterial isolates. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro susceptibility tests showed that levofloxacin had the highest cumulative efficacy against bacterial isolates. Netilmycin showed the highest efficacy against staphylococcus aureus, the most common bacterial isolate in this study.
TI  - Extracellular DNA in biofilms.
AB  - Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. Its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, then Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. Autolysis is the common mechanism by which eDNA is released. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. In E. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. In Staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. In S. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in S. epidermidis by the autolysin protein AtlE. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is located primarily in the stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. In S. aureus the crucial role of eDNA in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of DNase I. eDNA represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. eDNA and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the TLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
TI  - Microbiological profile of peritoneal dialysis peritonitis and predictors of hospitalization.
AB  - Peritonitis, the major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), is associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is a major cause of hospitalization and transfer to hemodialysis. In the present study, we aimed to identify predictors of hospitalization in PD-related peritonitis and to examine its microbiology profile over time in our unit to determine the best therapeutic approach. We studied all peritonitis episodes that occurred in a 6-year period (January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2009), evaluating whether adequate treatment could be delivered on an outpatient basis. During the study period, 411 patients were on PD, and 229 peritonitis episodes were recorded in 91 patients. Peritonitis were treated according to unit protocol. The average hospital stay was 11.6 +/- 6.6 days. We observed an increase of Streptococcus (to 19.4% from 7.7%) and a stabilization of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus (from 9.5%, 22.6%, and 3.2% to 7.7%, 30.8%, and 3.8% respectively) peritonitis episodes. The main risk factors for hospitalization were fungal infection, poor 72-hour outcome, inability to perform self-care, and age greater than 80 years. We observed a decline in the incidence of peritonitis, and despite changes in its microbiology profile, no loss of sensitivity to antibiotics used was observed.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
AB  - Gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. To investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. Gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for St. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Bacitracin showed activity for St. pyogenes only. The strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aacA-aphD. The growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of P. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. Furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using S. aureus, S. epidermidis, St. pyogenes, and P. aeruginosa. At doses of more than 32 microg/ml of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. The concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. Therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections in the community.
TI  - Integrated analysis of three bacterial conjunctivitis trials of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%: etiology of bacterial conjunctivitis and antibacterial susceptibility profile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to report on the bacterial species isolated from patients with bacterial conjunctivitis participating in three clinical trials of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, and their in vitro antibacterial susceptibility profiles. METHODS: Microbial data from three clinical studies, conducted at multiple clinical sites in the US and Asia were integrated. Species were identified at a central laboratory, and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for various antibiotics, including beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. RESULTS: A total of 1324 bacterial pathogens representing more than 70 species were isolated. The most common species were Haemophilus influenzae (26.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.4%). H. influenzae was most frequently isolated among patients aged 1-18 years, while S. aureus was most prevalent among those >65 years. Drug resistance was prevalent: Of H. influenzae isolates, 25.3% were beta-lactamase positive and 27.2% of S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-intermediate/ resistant; of S. aureus isolates, 13.7% were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and of these, 65.4% were ciprofloxacin-resistant, while 45.9% of S. epidermidis isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSE), and, of these, 47.1% were ciprofloxacin-resistant. Besifloxacin was more potent than comparator fluoroquinolones overall, and particularly against Gram-positive bacteria. Against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA and MRSE, besifloxacin was four-fold to >/= 128-fold more potent than other fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: While the pathogen distribution in bacterial conjunctivitis has not changed, drug resistance is increasing. Patient age and local antibiotic resistance trends should be considered in the treatment of this ocular infection. Besifloxacin showed broad-spectrum in vitro activity and was particularly potent against multidrug-resistant staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed lung cancer samples.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental data suggest an association between the presence of bacterial and/or fungal infection and the development of different types of cancer, independently of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. This has also been postulated for the development of lung cancer, however the prevalence and the exact species of the bacteria and fungi implicated, have not yet been described. AIM: To determine the presence of bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically extracted samples of patients with lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center prospective, observational study, tissue samples were surgically extracted from 32 consecutive patients with lung cancer, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to identify the presence of bacteria and fungi strains. RESULTS: The analysis of the electrophoresis data pointed out diversity between the samples and the strains that were identified. Mycoplasma strains were identified in all samples. Strains that appeared more often were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis and Bacillus strains, followed in descending frequency by Chlamydia, Candida, Listeria, and Haemophilus influenza. In individual patients Legionella pneumophila and Candida tropicalis were detected. CONCLUSIONS: A diversity of pathogens could be identified in surgically extracted tissue samples of patients with lung cancer, with mycoplasma strains being present in all samples. These results point to an etiologic role for chronic infection in lung carcinogenesis. Confirmation of these observations and additional studies are needed to further characterize the etiologic role of inflammation in lung carcinogenesis.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for species identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop and evaluate a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneous detection of 10 bacterial species causing bovine mastitis namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus simulans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli in milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A two-tube mPCR assay was developed. The accuracy of the mPCR was evaluated using 56 standard reference strains and 705 strains comprising of E. coli (n = 99), staphylococci (n = 522) and streptococci (n = 84). The threshold of detection of the mPCR assay was 10 fg of genomic DNA and <10(3) CFU ml(-1). A comparative evaluation of mPCR with culture method using 115 milk samples from subclinical mastitis showed mPCR to be more efficacious. Subsequently, the mPCR showed successful detection of target bacteria, when applied directly for the assessment of 36 bulk milk samples. CONCLUSION: The developed mPCR assay was found to be simple, rapid, reliable and specific in species identification of 10 bacteria at a time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay will be useful for the detection of mastitis, testing bacteriological safety of milk and for species level differentiation. The assay will be of value in the dairy sector for diagnosis and research. The early and accurate identification of pathogens will enable timely interventions for the treatment and control of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - Electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on Titanium Grade 2 and Ti6Al4V alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  The aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure Grade 2 Ti and Ti Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. Ti Grade 2 and Ti Grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130V for pure titanium; 100 and 120V for Ti6Al4V alloy. Surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS probe, laser profilometry and X-ray diffractometry. Bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. Osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. The higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130V) and Ti6Al4V alloy (120V) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and Ti6Al4V and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. The observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.
TI  - [The characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. The bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various Gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from June 2005 to December 2006. There were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (S.epidermidis, S. xylosus, S.capitis, S.saccharolyticus), Propionobacterium acnes, Streptococcus spp. (S.agalactiae, S.pyogenes) i Corynebacterium spp. (C. striatum, C. amycolatum, C. aquaticum). In the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. The resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives.
AB  - A series of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives was synthesized. Antimicrobial activity assessment indicates that compounds 1, 26, 27 and 28 exhibit strong activity against gram-positive bacterial strains, including Beta-hemolytic streptococcus CMCC32210, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212 and methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300 (MRSA). Compound 27 shows the best anti-MRSA activity with an MIC value of 0.031 mug/ml. To assess the mechanism of action, the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV were also measured. The results indicate that compound 1 has strong inhibitory effects on the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supercoiling activity and S. aureus Topo IV relaxing activity.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Fibrin- and collagen-based matrices attenuate inflammatory and procoagulant responses in human endothelial cell cultures exposed to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a serious complication after heart valve replacement. Autologous valves constructed by matrix-based tissue engineering are under investigation to increase biocompatibility. The impact of the underlying matrix on the risk to develop IE is not known. The IE is characterized by bacterial adhesion and subsequent interactions of disseminating bacteria with endothelial cells (ECs) and monocytes, evoking endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant activity, leading to heart valve destruction. In the current study, we, therefore, have seeded human ECs on a fibrin versus collagen gel matrix and, at confluence, infected them with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Especially Sta. aureus infected ECs grown on fibrin (4.2% of the inoculum) and collagen (3.7%) matrices, more than on ECs grown on noncoated plates (1.2%; p<0.01). This was associated with higher monocyte adhesion (61%; p<0.01 on fibrin and 43%; p<0.05 on collagen) versus control cultures (30%), even at comparable EC surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. The collagen matrix attenuated the Sta. aureus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression 2.0-fold, compared with the noncoated control ECs. This reduction coincided with a 4.2-5.0-fold reduction of the procoagulant activity, triggered in ECs grown on noncoated wells, as a consequence of tissue factor (TF) expression by ECs, further stimulated by EC-bound monocytes. Overall, moderate responses were seen on infection with Str. sanguis and Sta. epidermidis for both gel matrices. Thus, even when fibrin and collagen gel matrices equally increase bacterial adhesion, and subsequent monocyte adhesion to infected ECs, these matrices modulate EC responses to these stimuli, thus resulting in attenuated cytokine production and attenuated adherent monocyte-dependent TF production by the ECs. Further investigations will need to confirm whether also in vivo, EC-matrix interactions can attenuate EC responses to bacteria and inflammatory cells to reduce IE at infected endovascular sites.
TI  - Characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-Lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  - Anti-Lactobacillus johnsonii (LJ) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with LJ reacted with glyceroglycolipids in LJ, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (DH-DG), trihexaosyl DG (TH-DG) and tetrahexaosyl DG (TetH-DG), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. Structural analyses of glycolipids from LJ revealed that DH-DG was Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG, and TH-DG and TetH-DG were novel derivatives of it with alpha-Gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG and Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG, respectively. DH-DG was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but TetH-DG was restricted to LJ, L. intestinalis and L. reuteri, while the TH-DGs from L. casei were Glc1-6Galalpha1-2Glcalpha1-3'DG and an esterified derivative of it, Glc1-6Galalpha1-2Glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'DG, as reported in the literature. Anti-LJ antisera reacted with TH-DG and esterified TH-DG from L. casei to lesser extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl DG from Staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl DG from Streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-Gal residues. The major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. Also, human IgM antibodies against TH-DG and TetH-DG from LJ were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, TH-DG and TetH-DG.
TI  - Establishment of the first international repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains: ISBT working party transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (WP-TTID), subgroup on bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still remains  a significant problem in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. The International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases, Subgroup on Bacteria, organised an international study on Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria References to be used as a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four Bacteria References (Staphylococcus epidermidis PEI-B-06, Streptococcus pyogenes PEI-B-20, Klebsiella pneumoniae PEI-B-08 and Escherichia coli PEI-B-19) were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in PCs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in PCs after low spiking (0.3 and 0.03 CFU/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. RESULTS: Bacteria References were correctly identified in 98% of all 52 identifications. S. pyogenes and E. coli grew in PCs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. The results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95% confidence intervals were for S. epidermidis: 1.19-1.32 x 10(7) CFU/ml, S. pyogenes: 0.58-0.69 x 10(7) CFU/ml, K. pneumoniae: 18.71-20.26 x 10(7) CFU/ml and E. coli: 1.78-2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: The study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in PCs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. These aims were successfully fulfilled. The WHO Expert Committee Biological Standardisation has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first Repository for Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria Reference Strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repository.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - [Main pathogens and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility in bacterial keratitis: 5-year study, 2005-2009].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of bacterial keratitis at the Sorocaba Ophthalmological Hospital and the in vitro susceptibility of main antimicrobial used in the treatment of this pathology. METHODS: Retrospective study of all patients suspected of infectious keratitis that underwent microbiological exam at the Sorocaba Ophthalmological Hospital, between 2005 and 2009. To test susceptibility of antimicrobial drugs, antibiograms were made through the standard method of discs diffusion and interpretation following the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, Villanova, PA, USA). RESULTS: 963 samples were obtained in this period and 278 (28.86%) were positive for some pathogen. Among the positive for bacteria, the most common were Staphylococcus aureus (30.56%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (30.56%), Streptococcus sp (9.43%) and Pseudomonas sp (9.43%). Dividing in Gram's method, 191 (72.08%) were Gram-positive and 74 (27.92%) were Gram-negative. Analyzing in vitro antimicrobial effectiveness, the majority presented good susceptibility rates, beyond 85%, except cephalotin which presented 53.13%. At the same analysis, higher resistance rates with cephalotin (33.47%) and ciprofloxacin (11.36%) were noted. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria were the most common pathogen isolated at microbiologic exams, especially staphylococci. despite the increasing number of isolated Gram-negative bacteria, meanly represented by Pseudomonas, related with the widespread use of contact lenses. Laboratorial exam revealed high sensibility values for most of antibiotics (more than 85%), except for cephalotin (53.13%). Higher resistance values were observed with cephalotin (33.47%) and ciprofloxacin (11.36%). With all these important variability of antibiotic susceptibility and pathogens involved in bacterial keratitis etiology, it is very important to know the specific characteristics of each infection for a better patient care.
TI  - LEADER Program results for 2009: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using 6,414 clinical isolates from 56 medical centers in the United States.
AB  - The LEADER Program monitors the in vitro activity of linezolid in sampled U.S. medical centers using reference broth microdilution methods with supporting molecular investigations in a central laboratory design. This report summarizes data obtained in 2009, the 6th consecutive year of this longitudinal study. A total of 6,414 isolates from 56 medical centers in all nine Census regions across the United States participated in 2009. For the six leading species/groups, the following linezolid MIC(90) values were observed: Staphylococcus aureus, 2 mug/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 1 mug/ml; Enterococcus spp., 2 mug/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 mug/ml; viridans group streptococci, 1 mug/ml; and beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 mug/ml. Linezolid resistance was only 0.34% overall, with no evidence of significant increase in the LEADER Program since 2006. The predominant linezolid resistant mechanism found was a G2576T mutation in the 23S rRNA. L3/L4 riboprotein mutations were also found. The mobile multidrug-resistant cfr gene was found in four strains (two S. aureus strains and one strain each of S. epidermidis and S. capitis) from four different states, suggesting persistence but a lack of dissemination. Linezolid continues to exhibit excellent activity and spectrum, and this study documents the need for continued monitoring of emerging mechanisms of resistance over a wide geographic area.
TI  - Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Bignoniaceae) as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - This study evaluated, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of the hexane extract  (JCHE), methanol extract (JCME), and chloroform fraction (JCCF) of bark from Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Family Bignoniaceae), a Brazilian medicinal plant, traditionally used as anti-syphilis and anti-gonorrhea treatment. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion method followed by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. JCHE was not active against the bacteria evaluated. JCME presented antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 16.3 mg/mL, 9.1 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. JCCF was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, S. pyogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and N. gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 18.3 mg/mL, 9.3 mg/mL, 6.3 mg/mL, 6.1 mg/mL, 9.2 mg/mL, 6.2 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. Phytochemical analysis of JCME and JCCF gave positive results for saponins, coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, quinones, alkaloids, triterpenes, and steroids. Verbascoside was isolated and identified as a major peak in JCME and JCCF high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and might contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Foam sclerotherapy: investigating the need for sterile air.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerotherapy with foam is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of varicose veins. There is no consensus on the necessity of sterile air or other gases to produce foam. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential risk of bacterial inoculation of polidocanol (POL) foam using room air and the antimicrobial properties of polidocanol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The amount of airborne microorganisms was quantitatively measured. Four bacterial strains were tested for susceptibility to polidocanol: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Air measurements varied as a result of air movement and the number of people in the room. Although the risk of introducing one colony-formin unit can be calculated as less than 1 in 330, the clinical relevance is still to be determined. No inhibition of bacterial growth was achieved with POL in of any of the tested strains. CONCLUSIONS: Foam sclerotherapy with POL prepared in a standard treatment room is a safe procedure without the risk of introducing a severe bacterial complication. The use of sterile air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide is unnecessary and will make foam sclerotherapy with POL more elaborate and more expensive to use.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of MX-2401, an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide active in the presence of lung surfactant.
AB  - MX-2401 is an expanded-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic selective for Gram-positive bacteria that is a semisynthetic analog of the naturally occurring lipopeptide amphomycin. It was active against Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus (VSE), vanA-, vanB-, and vanC-positive vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), linezolid- and quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant isolates (MIC(90) of 4 mug/ml), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml), and Streptococcus spp. including viridans group streptococci, and penicillin-resistant, penicillin-sensitive, penicillin-intermediate and macrolide-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) of 2 mug/ml). MX-2401 demonstrated a dose-dependent postantibiotic effect varying from 1.5 to 2.4 h. Furthermore, MX-2401 was rapidly bactericidal at 4 times the MIC against S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, with more than 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial attained at 4 and 24 h, respectively. The MICs of MX-2401 against MRSA, MSSA, VSE, and VRE strains serially exposed for 15 passages to sub- to supra-MICs of MX-2401 remained within three dilutions of the original MIC. In contrast to that of the lipopeptide daptomycin, the antibacterial activity of MX-2401 was not affected in vitro by the presence of lung surfactant, and MX-2401 was active in vivo in the bronchial-alveolar pneumonia mouse model, in which daptomycin failed to show any activity. Moreover, the activity of MX-2401 was not as strongly dependent on the Ca(2+) concentration as is the activity of daptomycin. In conclusion, MX-2401 is a promising new-generation lipopeptide for the treatment of serious infections with Gram-positive bacteria, including hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Endophthalmitis and wound dehiscence following late removal of penetrating keratoplasty sutures.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The patient characteristics, risk factors, and outcome  of penetrating keratoplasty (PK) wound dehiscence following late suture removal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 207 cases of PK performed between 2005 and 2007 in Beilinson Hospital, Israel. RESULTS: Analysis of 207 patients who underwent PK revealed 4 cases (an incidence of 1.93%) that developed spontaneous wound dehiscence with severe endophthalmitis following late suture removal. Mean time from transplantation to suture removal was 22.18 months (range: 18 to 26 months). The time from suture removal to endophthalmitis was on average 2.25 weeks. All patients underwent vitrectomy with injection of intraocular antibiotics. The causative microorganism was found to be Streptococcus species in three patients and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one patient. One patient retained a clear corneal graft, another patient is scheduled for repeat PK, and the last two patients lost sight (50%). CONCLUSION: Endophthalmitis and wound dehiscence following late suture removal after PK are rare complications, but the end result can be devastating to the transplanted eye when they do occur. Careful monitoring and close follow-up can aid in early identification and treatment of such complications and may prevent loss of sight. Newer methods of corneal transplantation, such as Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty, should be considered as a better alternative to PK whenever the case qualifies as such.
TI  - Crystal structures of Staphylococcus epidermidis mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase bound to inhibitory analogs reveal new insight into substrate binding and catalysis.
AB  - The polyisoprenoid compound undecaprenyl phosphate is required for biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycans in gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus spp. In these organisms, the mevalonate pathway is used to produce the precursor isoprenoid, isopentenyl 5-diphosphate. Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes formation of isopentenyl 5-diphosphate in an ATP-dependent irreversible reaction and is therefore an attractive target for inhibitor development that could lead to new antimicrobial agents. To facilitate exploration of this possibility, we report the crystal structure of Staphylococcus epidermidis MDD (1.85 A resolution) and, to the best of our knowledge, the first structures of liganded MDD. These structures include MDD bound to the mevalonate 5-diphosphate analogs diphosphoglycolyl proline (2.05 A resolution) and 6-fluoromevalonate diphosphate (FMVAPP; 2.2 A resolution). Comparison of these structures provides a physical basis for the significant differences in K(i) values observed for these inhibitors. Inspection of enzyme/inhibitor structures identified the side chain of invariant Ser(192) as making potential contributions to catalysis. Significantly, Ser --> Ala substitution of this side chain decreases k(cat) by approximately 10(3)-fold, even though binding interactions between FMVAPP and this mutant are similar to those observed with wild type MDD, as judged by the 2.1 A cocrystal structure of S192A with FMVAPP. Comparison of microbial MDD structures with those of mammalian counterparts reveals potential targets at the active site periphery that may be exploited to selectively target the microbial enzymes. These studies provide a structural basis for previous observations regarding the MDD mechanism and inform future work toward rational inhibitor design.
TI  - Expression of plectasin in Pichia pastoris and its characterization as a new antimicrobial peptide against Staphyloccocus and Streptococcus.
AB  - Recombinant plectasin, the first fungus defensin, was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified, and its physical, chemical and antimicrobial characteristics were studied. Following a 120 h induction of recombinant yeast, the amount of total secreted protein reached 748.63 mug/ml. The percentage of recombinant plectasin was estimated to be 71.79% of the total protein. After purification with a Sephadex G-25 column and RP-HPLC, the identity of plectasin was verified by MALDI-TOF MS. Plectasin exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphyloccocusaureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis. At a concentration of 2560 mug/ml, this peptide showed approximately equal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. suis, and S. pneumoniae, when compared to 320 mug/ml vancomycin, 640 mug/ml penicillin, 320 mug/ml vancomycin and 160 mug/ml vancomycin, respectively. In addition, plectasin showed anti-S. aureus activity over a wide pH range of 2.0 and 10.0, a high thermal stability at 100 degrees C for 1h and remarkable resistance to papain and pepsin. The expression and characterization of recombinant plectasin in P. pastoris has potential to treat Streptococcus and Staphyloccocus infections when most traditional antibiotics show no effect on them. Our results indicate that plectasin can be produced in large quantities, and that it has pharmaceutical importance for the prevention and clinical treatment of Staphyloccocus and Streptococcus infections.
TI  - Effects of intramammary infections on somatic cell score and milk yield in Sarda  sheep.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effects of intramammary infections (IMI) on somatic cell score (SCS) and milk yield in dairy ewes. METHODS: Monthly milk samples were collected from a flock of 202 Sarda sheep, over a period of 7 months, for bacteriological culture and measurement of somatic cell counts (SCC). During the same period, milk yield was measured daily using electronic milk meters connected to each half-udder cluster of the milking machine. SCC was transformed to SCS using a base-2 log transformation. One SCS is equivalent to a SCC of 25,000 cells/ml, and each increase of 1 in SCS is associated with doubling of the SCC. IMI was defined by the presence of five or more colonies of similar morphology isolated from a milk sample (>/=500 cfu/ml). The effect of IMI on SCS and milk yield was assessed using a generalised estimating equation (GEE). RESULTS: There were 1,186 udder halves with IMI from 2,828 milk samples, a prevalence of 41.9%. The distribution of bacterial species within the 1,186 culture-positive samples was comprised of 476 (40.1%) Staphylococcus epidermidis, 172 (14.5%) Staph. chromogenes, 38 (3.2%) Staph. caprae, 134 (11.3%) Staph. simulans, 114 (9.6%) Streptococcus uberis, 123 (10.4%) Strep. dysgalactiae, and 129 (10.9%) Strep. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. SCS was greater in udder halves with IMI (mean 7.71; SD 0.82) than in udder halves without IMI (mean 5.53; SD 1.02) (p<0.01). IMI due to streptococcal species were associated with greater SCS (mean 8.24; SD 0.62) than those due to staphylococcal species (mean 7.48; SD 0.79) (p<0.01). Milk yield from udder halves with IMI was lower (mean 439 (SD 162) ml/half udder/day) than from udder halves without IMI (mean 602 (SD 170) ml/half udder/day) (p<0.01). IMI due to staphylococcal species was associated with a lower milk yield (mean 399 (SD 167) ml/half udder/day) than IMI due to streptococcal species (mean 427 (SD 156) ml/half udder/day) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide sheep milk producers with information on the losses associated with subclinical mastitis, which can be used to evaluate the economics of prevention and treatment protocols concerning udder health in ovine dairy flocks.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - CONTEXT: Development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. Twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. Eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. Powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Water extract of Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of Ficus carica L. (Moraceae) and Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) leaves and Peganum harmala L. (Nitrariaceae) seeds had MIC ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. S. aromaticum inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. F. carica and O. europaea inhibited growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. pyogenes whereas P. harmala was effective against S. aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Candida albicans. Ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had MIC >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(3-alkoxyimino-4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(3-alkoxyimino-4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. All of the target compounds have potent antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, and exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs: 0.125-4 mug/mL). Compound 22, with the best activity against Gram-positive strains, is 4-16 fold more potent than gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin against Enterococcus faecalis, and 16- and 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against S. epidermidis 09-6 and S. pneumoniae 08-4, respectively.
TI  - Antagonistic bacteria from live corals, Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India.
AB  - The objective of this study is to isolate and production of secondary metabolites with bioactive substances by coral reef (Acropora formosa and Favia palida) associated bacteria was carried out from the Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India. The isolated coral associated bacteria were found to have an antagonistic effect against 10 human pathogens. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aerogenosa, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. faecalis and Bacillus cereus. It was observed that, out of the total 689 bacterial strains isolated, 10 and 13% of isolates from A. formosa and Favia palida, respectively were found to have antagonistic activity against the pathogens, A higher percentage of antagonistic strains were conferred from Favia palida with 13%. It was observed that all antagonistic strains were able to inhibit at least two of the human pathogens.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(3-amino-6,7-dihydro-2-methyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c] pyridin-5(4H)-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(3-amino-6,7-dihydro-2-methyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin- 5(4H)-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by 1H-NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Results reveal that most of the target compounds exhibit good growth inhibitory potency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (MIC: 0.25-4 mug/mL) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC: 0.25-1 mug/mL). In addition, compound 8f is 8-128 fold more potent than the reference drugs gemifloxacin (GM), moxifloxacin (MX), ciprofloxacin (CP) and levofloxacin (LV) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 10-05 and Streptococcus hemolyticus 1002 and 2-64 fold more active against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 10-03 and 10-04.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. However, with the exception of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. METHODS: We cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with THP-1 monocyte-like cells. We performed 16S rDNA analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCR analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether THP-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. RESULTS: We recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with THP-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. On average, tissue homogenates incubated with THP-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (P = 0.02). We recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, and confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qPCR demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) P. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. Our results suggest revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of dalbavancin and telavancin against staphylococci and streptococci isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - Two novel lipoglycopeptides, dalbavancin and telavancin, and relevant comparative agents were tested for in vitro activity against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci collected in the cross-Canada surveillance study, CANWARD, in 2007-2009. The rank order of potency (based on MIC(90) [mug/mL], i.e., the concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit the growth of 90% of isolates tested) of glycopeptides against both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was dalbavancin (0.06 mug/mL) >telavancin (0.5 mug/mL) > vancomycin (1-2 mug/mL); concurrent susceptibility or resistance to oxacillin in staphylococci did not affect potency of glycopeptides. Dalbavancin and telavancin also demonstrated potent activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates (MIC(90), </= 0.03 mug/mL; </= 0.06 mug/mL), and Streptococcus pyogenes (</= 0.03 mug/mL; 0.06 mug/mL). Based on their robust in vitro activities, dalbavancin and telavancin have the potential to treat Gram-positive infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Effective of metronidazole to bacterial flora in vagina and the impact of microbes on live birth rate during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of bacterial vaginal flora on life-birth rate during ICSI and influence of metronidazole as antibiotic treatment course before ICSI. METHOD: We enrolled 71 women who were undergoing ICSI. At embryo transfer (ET), all of the women had quantitative vaginal culture, ET catheter-tip culture, and vaginal Gram stain scored for bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: The overall live birth rate (LBR) was 36.6% (26/71), and the rate of early pregnancy loss was 13% (4/30). In women with bacterial vaginosis, intermediate flora and normal flora, the conception rates were 35% (9/26), 42% (14/33) and 58% (7/12), respectively (p = 0.06 for trend). Metronidazole effect to bacterial flora in vaginal. The predominant species isolated from the tip of the embryo transfer catheter in negative pregnancy was Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 vs. 15.2%), and Streptococcus viridians (11 vs. 24%). CONCLUSIONS: Woman with bacterial vaginosis and with a decreased vaginal concentration of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli may have decreased conception rates and increased rates of failed pregnancy. A larger prospective treatment trial designed to evaluate the impact on ICSI outcomes of optimizing the vaginal flora prior to ICSI may be warranted.
TI  - Evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant Lunasan produced by Candida sphaerica UCP 0995.
AB  - Different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. Candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees C and 150 rpm. The cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). The critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mN m(-1). Several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus oralis (68%), Candida albicans (57%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. Furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus sanguis12. Inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. Results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.
TI  - Use of daptomycin in complicated cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious form of infection with a high mortality. Medical management can be a challenge because of organ dysfunction, lack of clinical response or allergy to the recommended antibiotics. Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with a potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. There are limited data on the use of daptomycin in complicated cases of IE. We aim to report our experience of daptomycin use in complicated cases of IE through a prospective observational study (from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009). Daptomycin was prescribed for cases that were either unresponsive or allergic to the standard therapy. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. Success was defined as clinical improvement accompanied with the resolution of laboratory markers of sepsis and continuation of the above findings for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy. Eight cases were evaluable. Native and prosthetic valves were involved in equal proportions. The range of organisms was wide: Staphylococcus aureus, two cases; S. epidermidis, two cases; streptococci, two cases; and Enterococcus faecalis, two cases. The median duration of therapy was 42 days. All patients were successfully treated. Daptomycin was well tolerated. Daptomycin is useful in the management of complicated cases of IE.
TI  - Chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. This study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the PDI efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by coincubation with hematoporphyrin (Hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the PDI effect or by addition after PDI and further incubation for 30 min. Under conditions in which Hp-PDI killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8) CFU/ml). Similar results were also found with toluidine blue O (TBO)-mediated PDI in planktonic and biofilm cells. However, without PDI treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by PDI. Further studies indicated that the potentiated PDI effect of chitosan was related to the level of PDI damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. These results indicate that the combination of PDI and chitosan is quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(3-alkoxyimino-5-amino/methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - We report herein the design and synthesis of novel 7-(3-alkoxyimino-5-amino/methylaminopiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives based on the structures of new fluoroquinolones IMB and DZH. The antibacterial activity of these newly synthesized compounds was also evaluated and compared with gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. Results revealed that all of the target compounds 10-27 have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus including MSSA (MIC: 0.125-8 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.25-16 mug/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC: 0.125-4 mug/mL), and Escherichia coli (MIC: 0.25-0.5 mug/mL). In particular, some compounds showed useful activity against several fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the most active compound 15 was found to be 16-128, 2-32, and 4-8-fold more potent than the three reference drugs against fluoroquinolone-resistant MSSA, MRSA, and MRSE.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of 102 blood disease patients with gram positive cocci infection treated with Linezolid.]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy and safety of linezolid for the treatment of gram positive coccus infections in hematological disease patients. METHODS: One hundred and two hematological disease patients with suspected or proven gram positive coccus bacteria infection were enrolled in this study. Linezolid was given at a dosage of 600 mg, iv, q12h. The mean treatment period was (10.82 +/- 5.12) days (1 to 51 days) with 74.5% over 7 d and 51.0% over 10 d. RESULTS: Among 102 patients, 57 were male, 45 female aged 11 to 81 years, with a mean of (45.26 +/- 19.15) years. Ninety four cases were nosocomial infection (92.2%) and 8 community infection (7.8%); There were pneumonia in 80 (78.4%), septicemia in 11 (10.8%), and infection of other organsin 11 (10.8%); Forty five cases were proven gram positive coccus bacteria infection, and 57 were suspected infection; Fifty one bacteria strains were isolated from cultivated samples of proven patients, in which 22 were staphylococcus aureus with 19 methicillin resistant 13 hemolytic streptococcus, 9 staphylococcus epidermidis with 7 methicillin resistant 6 enterococcus faecom, and 1 enterococcus hirae. Seven cases were mixed with one kind gram negative bacillus infection, 4 mixed with two kinds of gram negative bacillus infection, and 12 mixed with fungal infection; Total clinical response rates by ITT (intention to treatment) analysis was 69.6%, in which 40 (39.2%) were curative and 31 (30.4%) obviously effective; PP (per-protocol) analysis was 70.9%, in which 39 (41.9%) were curative and 27 (29.0%) obviously effective. Bacteria clearance rate was 70.6%, and in this group the clinical effective rate was 88.9%; Adverse effect rate was 2.9%, being transient thrombocytopenia and increased transaminase. CONCLUSION: Linezolid is a safe and effective antibiotic used in hematological disease patients complicated with infections of gram positive coccus.
TI  - Bacteriological aetiology and antimicrobial treatment of pleural empyema.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aims were to describe the aetiologies of culture-positive pleural infections and to evaluate the choice of empiric antimicrobial treatment regimens according to antimicrobial sensitivity, and to evaluate the possible influence of this on outcome. METHODS: All cases over a 9-y period were identified from 3 hospitals using the laboratory databases of the clinical microbiology departments, and were verified by evaluating the medical records. RESULTS: We identified 291 isolates in pleural fluid cultures from 158 patients. These included viridans streptococci (25%), Staphylococcus aureus (18%), anaerobic bacteria (17%), Enterobacteriaceae (12%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7%), with differences between nosocomial and community-acquired infections. The mortality (overall 27%) was highest among the patients with Enterobacteriaceae (50%) and S. aureus (36%) infections, and in patients with mixed infections (34%). The actual empiric treatment or the recommended penicillin plus metronidazole had low antimicrobial coverage (49%) compared to the proposed cefuroxime plus metronidazole (78%). Thoracentesis was often delayed (median 2 days). The adequacy of empiric antimicrobial therapy was independently correlated with mortality (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.62). CONCLUSIONS: The early diagnosis of pleural infection could be optimized. In this North-European patient population, we suggest that the recommended empiric antimicrobial treatment be changed to cefuroxime plus metronidazole for community-acquired and nosocomial infections.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis secondary to spinal analgesia and anaesthesia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although rare, infectious complications from spinal analgesia and anaesthesia (SA) can have serious morbidity and mortality. This study describes the clinical features and outcome of SA-associated bacterial meningitis in adults seen in a hospital over a 25 yearperiod. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients (aged >/=14 years) diagnosed with SA-associated bacterial meningitis between 1982 and 2006. RESULTS: Eight cases of SA-associated bacterial meningitis were diagnosed (3.3% bacterial meningitis), with a median age of 62 years (range, 35-80). SA procedures were: morphine infusion pumps with epidural (3 cases) or intrathecal (3) catheters, spinal cord stimulation with epidural neuroelectrode (1), and epidural anesthesia (1). Site of spinal insertion was: cervical (2 cases), thoracic (3), and lumbar (3). The median time to onset of meningitis was 26 days (range, 7-101) after AE. The most common clinical findings were fever (8 cases, 100%), headache (7 cases, 87.5%), and neck stiffness (4 cases, 50%). CSF abnormalities were pleocytosis (8 cases, 100%), elevated protein level (8 cases, 100%), and hypoglycorrhachia (5 cases, 62.5%). The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), and S. epidermidis and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1); one patient had a negative CSF culture. Treatment included antibiotics and to remove the analgesia device in all patients. There was one death (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: SA is a rare predisposing condition to bacterial meningitis but, due to the seriousness of the infection, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops fever or headache in this setting.
TI  - Bacterial growth kinetics in ACD-A apheresis platelets: comparison of plasma and  PAS III storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our objective was to determine the growth kinetics of bacteria in leukoreduced apheresis platelets (LR-AP) in a platelet (PLT) additive solution (PAS; InterSol, Fenwal, Inc.) compared to LR-AP stored in plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hyperconcentrated, double-dose LR-AP were collected from healthy donors with a separator (AMICUS, Fenwal, Inc.). LR-AP were evenly divided, InterSol was added to half (65% InterSol:35% plasma [PAS]), and PLTs in autologous plasma were used for a paired control (PL). Bacteria were inoculated into each LR-AP PAS/PL pair (0.5-1.6 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL), and bacterial growth was followed for up to 7 days. Time to the end of the lag phase, doubling times, maximum concentration (conc-max), and time to maximum concentration (time-max) were estimated. RESULTS: Streptococcus viridans did not grow to detectable levels in either PAS or PL units. The other bacteria had no significant overall difference in the conc-max (p = 0.47) or time-max (p = 0.7) between PL and PAS LR-AP; PL had a 0.14 hours faster doubling rate (p = 0.023); and PAS had a 4.7 hours shorter lag time (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: We observed that five index organisms will grow in LR-AP stored in a 35%:65% ratio of plasma to InterSol where initial bacterial concentrations are 0.5 to 1.6 CFUs/mL. The more rapid initiation of log-phase growth for bacteria within a PAS storage environment resulted in a bacterial concentration up to 4 logs higher in the PAS units compared to the plasma units at 24 hours, but with no difference in the conc-max. This may present an early bacterial detection advantage for PAS-stored PLTs.
TI  - [Comparative research of the efficacy of the gatifloxacin and levofloxacin for bacterial conjunctivitis in human eyes].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the different efficacy and safety to the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis between the fluoroquinolone antibiotics gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. METHODS: A multi-centre, random, double-blind and control trial was performed in six centers including Eye Ear Nose and Throat Hospital of Fudan University, Henan Eye Institute, Eye Hospital Affiliated to Wenzhou Medical College, the First Affiliated Hospital Of Nanjing Medical University, Xijing Hospital Affiliated to the Fourth Military Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University between August 2006 and October 2007. The levofloxacin was set as the efficient control. Two hundred and thirty-five patients (235 eyes) that diagnosed as bacterial conjunctivitis were randomly divided into two groups by the method of randomized blocks, the test group (gatifloxacin) had 118 eyes and the control (levofloxacin) group had 117 eyes. The drug delivery into conjunctival sac was performed at a 7-day period (two drops per time, eight times per day at the first two days and two drops per time, four times per day at the following 5 days). All participants were given the conjunctival sac germ culture and drug sensitive test before and after the study. The combination score of signs and symptoms and evaluation of safety were conducted at the pre-delivery day, the (4 +/- 1) and (7 +/- 1) delivery day. The statistic analysis was conducted by CMH chi(2) test, Pearson chi(2) test and Fisher's exact probabilities test. RESULTS: The efficacy of the two groups was 94.0% (110/117 eyes) in gatifloxacin group and 93.8% (106/113 eyes) in levofloxacin group with no significant difference (chi(2) = 0.052, P = 0.8201). There was also no difference in the bacteria clearance between the two groups [gatifloxacin versus levofloxacin, 94.1% (80/85 eyes) versus 92.5% (74/80 eyes), P = 0.3470]. The decrease of combination score of signs and symptoms at the (4 +/- 1) delivery day was 4.436 +/- 2.310 in the gatifloxacin group and 3.814 +/- 1.962 in the levofloxacin group, the difference of which was significant (F = 7.280, P = 0.0075). This trend was also proved at the (7 +/- 1) delivery day (gatifloxacin versus levofloxacin, 7.487 +/- 2.821 versus 6.912 +/- 2.911, F = 4.060, P = 0.0452). The visual acuity and the tolerance after local application of the eye drops between the two groups had no difference (the visual acuity F = 1.04, P = 0.3080; the tolerance after local admission chi(2) = 0.1372, P = 0.7111). According to the result of the germ culture, the major pathogenic bacteria were Gram-positive bacteria (totally 20 kinds of Gram-positive bacteria and 8 kinds of Gram-negative bacteria). The MIC and drug resistance of gatifloxacin to the Gram-positive bacteria was lower than that of the levofloxacin (Staphylococcus Epidermidis, Staphylococcus Aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus). CONCLUSIONS: The gatifloxacin eye drop has a good therapeutic effect to the bacterial conjunctivitis. It can effectively clear the pathogen with fast and strong effect. Moreover, it has a low MIC in vitro, advance a prospect in drug resistance, safety and ocular tolerance.
TI  - Maxillary sinuses microbiology from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - There isn't definitive and consistent data concerning the distribution of bacterial species in patients with Chronic Sinusitis (CS). The variability of the results from studies in CS may be due to the different techniques used as collection method, variations in culture methods, previous antibiotic use, and difficulty in distinguishing bacterial flora from pathogenic agents. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical prospective. AIM: To identify the incidence of microorganisms in patients with CRS by growing bacteria from the secretion of the maxillary sinus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 62 patients that had undergone FESS for treatment of chronic sinusitis; cultures from the maxillary sinus were obtained. RESULTS: 62 samples, 33 (53.2%) had no growth; 29 (45.2%) counts of aerobic bacteria; one case (1.6%) of fungus growth; we did not find anaerobic bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the one more frequently found - 8 samples (27.6%), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 samples each; Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 samples (10.4%); other Gram negative agents in 17 samples (31%). CONCLUSION: In the present study we concluded that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Gram negatives bacteria and Staphylococcus spp were the representatives of the bacterial flora found in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CS.
TI  - Limitations of current antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  - Bacterial conjunctivitis is a common ocular infection that is generally treated empirically with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The more common pathogens causing bacterial conjunctivitis include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Moraxella species. Several antibiotics traditionally used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis are no longer widely prescribed because of increased bacterial resistance and/or safety concerns. The introduction of the fluoroquinolone class of anti-infectives offered effective and better tolerated treatment options. Nonetheless, successful therapy for bacterial conjunctivitis continues to be limited by several factors. A primary concern is the development of bacterial resistance that may be impacted not only by widespread antibiotic use but also by antibacterial pharmacokinetics, such as maintenance of insufficient bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection. In addition, poor adherence to prescribed regimens that require frequent administration, along with undesirable adverse events, affects the development of bacterial resistance and the success of treatment regimens. This article reviews current antibacterial agents used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, factors that limit their successful use in treatment, and options for future development of more effective topical ophthalmic anti-infective agents.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of novel fluoroquinolone derivatives containing substituted piperidines.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-aminomethyl-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated and correlated with their physicochemical properties. Results reveal that all of the target compounds have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.125-4 microg/mL). Compounds 12, 13 are more potent than or comparable to levofloxacin against MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella sonnei. Compound 17 is more active than or comparable to levofloxacin against S. aureus including MRSA, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  - The tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. The goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. Tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. Samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. Aerobic cultivation identified Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. For culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16S rRNA sequences using the Ribosomal Database Project Pipeline programs developed at Michigan State University. Dominant genera identified by 16S rRNA analysis in pigs from both herds included Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. These genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. In contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. In addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. Our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. This is the first analysis using 16S rRNA sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in the porcine upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to define the limit of detection (LOD), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. METHODS: A PCR algorithm consisting of initial broad-based detection of Eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or Gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. The 16S rRNA gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. Pathogen-specific probes were designed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. The LOD and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. A total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clinical samples obtained from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. RESULTS: The LOD of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. Time to detection was 3 hours. In clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or Gram-typing probes. Adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% CI = 65.3% to 98.6%). The universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A broad-based multiprobe PCR assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. Findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Bacteriology of occluded nasolacrimal ducts in infants].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Connatal lacrimal duct stenosis (cLDO) commonly causes purulent bacterial dacyrocystitis. The recommended treatment of choice is up to the sixth month of life a conservative antimicrobiological therapy. After the sixth month lacrimal duct irrigation with silicone tube intubation remains the gold standard. Our purpose was to analyse the current bacterial spectrum in cLDO and to compile a bacterial resistogram in order to specify antimicrobiological therapy. METHODS: 66 samples from the lacrimal duct of 6- to 16-month-old children (41 female, 25 male) were obtained by collecting the refluxing liquids with cotton wool swabs after irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system with sterile saline during lacrimal duct surgery. Cultures were incubated aerobically and anaerobically and the infectious agents were isolated. Sensitivity testing was performed for each isolate, testing 8 different commonly used local antibiotics. Data were statistically analysed using SPSS. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in cLDO in 97 %, showing co-colonisation in 87 % with up to five bacterial strains. Gram-positive bacteria were seen in 72 % of the isolates in cLDO with Streptococcus pneumoniae (31 %) being the most abundant strain, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (13 %) and S. epidermidis (13 %). In 85 % of the samples at least one Gram-negative rod was present, most often Branhamella (12 %), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (11 %). Sensitivity testing revealed chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin to be the most effective drugs in cLDO, whereas erythromycin and gentamycin turned out to be insufficient in treating cLDO. CONCLUSION: Bacterial colonisation plays a crucial role in cLDO, showing a positive culture in 97 % with frequent co-colonisation of several bacterial strains (often in combination with at least one Gram-negative strain). The sampling of a microbiological probe of the lacrimal duct is recommended at least in therapy-refractory cases. Current bacteria in cLDO can be effectively treated with chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin. The commonly used antibiotics erythromycin and gentamicin are inappropriate as monotherapeutics.
TI  - Prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in central part of Croatia.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of SBP. This prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of SBP: SBP group (n=23) and non-SBP group (n=85). Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. The pathogens responsible for SBP were analyzed in SBP group. The prevalence of SBP was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. Statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; P=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; P=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; P=0.05). The incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5% vs. 50%; P=0.892). The following pathogens were responsible for SBP: Escherichia coli (n=7), MRSA (n=2), Acinetobacter spp. (n=2), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1), Streptococcus spp. (n=1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). As indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of SBP were high. Patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven SBP. The pathogens responsible for SBP were mostly gram-negative microorganisms; however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of thymol and carvacrol derivatives.
AB  - Fourteen esters of thymol and carvacrol were synthesized and characterized on the basis of spectral data. The NMR data for some of these are being given for the first time. The antibacterial activity screening of thymol, carvacrol and their esters were carried out against four Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 121, Staphylococcus epidermidis MTCC 435) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli MTCC 723) bacteria. The enhancement in activity was noticed in the thymyl ester derivatives 4a-c (against S. mutans, B. subtilis and S. epidermidis) in comparison to thymol, whereas the carvacrol derivatives were found to be much less active than carvacrol.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - [The role of microflora in etiology of chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Analysis of the results of a bacteriological study involving 218 patients with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (CT) has demonstrated that they were significantly different in terms of the seeding rate of beta-hemolytic group A Streptococci (BHAS). Specifically, these microorganisms were detected in patients with paratonsillar abscess 2.5 times as frequently as in those with uncomplicated forms of chronic tonsilitis. In other words, the former group is at risk of developing such concomitant diseases as post-streptococcal rheumocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis. It was shown that BHAS are capable of forming a biological film at the surface of abiogenic carriers in vitro which may be a principal cause of chronic and recurring tonsillitis.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Periorbital and orbital cellulitis: a 10-year review of hospitalized children.
AB  - PURPOSE: Periorbital cellulitis is often difficult to distinguish from orbital cellulitis, which is a potentially lethal infection involving the contents of the orbit. A delay in diagnosis and appropriate treatment may result in serious complications. We studied the predisposing factors, microbiologic data, clinical features, complications, and treatment of periorbital and orbital cellulitis in childhood. METHODS: Eighty-three medical records of patients (mean age 3.7 +/- 3.1 years) admitted to the Department of Pediatrics with a diagnosis of periorbital or orbital cellulitis during the 10-year period January 1997 to December 2007 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: In this series, periorbital cellulitis occurred more frequently (83%) than orbital cellulitis (17%). Of the children with periorbital cellulitis, 85% were younger than 5 years of age, while 62% of the children with orbital cellulitis were older than 5 years of age. The most common predisposing factors in periorbital cellulitis were upper respiratory infection (68%) and trauma to the eyelids (20%), while sinusitis was more frequently associated with orbital cellulitis (79%). Blood and skin cultures were usually negative. The most common isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Forty-five of the 83 children were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone + clindamycin (mean duration 8.6 +/- 5.5 days). Intravenous antibiotics alone was an effective management in most of the patients, but a small proportion (6%) required surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Upper respiratory infection and sinusitis are the most important predisposing factors for periocular infection. Streptococcus species are the predominant causative agents. Both diseases can usually be successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics, but some patients may require surgery to control extensive infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. Corticosteroid formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. The hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. Clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on C. albicans. In contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. Fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against S. pyogenes and no activity against C. albicans or E. coli. In summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. In limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. With the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.
TI  - Activation of TLR2 by a small molecule produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis increases antimicrobial defense against bacterial skin infections.
AB  - Production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelia is an essential defense against infectious pathogens. In this study we evaluated whether the commensal microorganism Staphylococcus epidermidis may enhance production of antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes and thus augment skin defense against infection. Exposure of cultured undifferentiated human keratinocytes to a sterile nontoxic small molecule of <10 kDa from S. epidermidis conditioned culture medium (SECM), but not similar preparations from other bacteria, enhanced human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) and hBD3 mRNA expression and increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit the growth of group A Streptococcus (GAS) and S. aureus. Partial gene silencing of hBD3 inhibited this antimicrobial action. This effect was relevant in vivo as administration of SECM to mice decreased susceptibility to infection by GAS. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was important to this process as a TLR2-neutralizing antibody blocked induction of hBDs 2 and 3, and Tlr2-deficient mice did not show induction of mBD4. Taken together, these findings reveal a potential use for normal commensal bacterium S. epidermidis to activate TLR2 signaling and induce antimicrobial peptide expression, thus enabling the skin to mount an enhanced response to pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of besifloxacin against staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that was recently approved for topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. The compound was shown to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including isolates resistant to other antibacterials. Here, the bactericidal activity of besifloxacin was evaluated against the most common bacterial conjunctivitis pathogens. METHODS: MIC, MBC and time-kill experiments with besifloxacin and comparators were performed according to CLSI guidelines. Quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were sequenced using standard PCR-based techniques. RESULTS: MIC and MBC data indicated that besifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 30), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 15) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 35), while all fluoroquinolones were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (n = 40). Besifloxacin MBC:MIC ratios were < or = 4 for 97.5% of all isolates tested (n = 120). All fluoroquinolones tested, as well as tobramycin, were bactericidal, while azithromycin was bactericidal against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, but bacteriostatic against the staphylococci. Time-kill assays with all four species showed that besifloxacin caused > or = 1000-fold killing within 2 h for 11 of 12 isolates. Only one isolate treated with moxifloxacin and three ciprofloxacin-treated isolates achieved the same level of bactericidal activity under the same conditions. Unlike the comparator fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin maintained a high potency and bactericidal activity even against strains that contained multiple mutations in the genes encoding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, besifloxacin demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against the four major human pathogens tested here, including isolates that showed in vitro resistance to other fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides or aminoglycosides.
TI  - New lipoglycopeptides: a comparative review of dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin.
AB  - Dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin are semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides that  demonstrate promise for the treatment of patients with infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Each of these agents contains a heptapeptide core, common to all glycopeptides, which enables them to inhibit transglycosylation and transpeptidation (cell wall synthesis). Modifications to the heptapeptide core result in different in vitro activities for the three semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides. All three lipoglycopeptides contain lipophilic side chains, which prolong their half-life, help to anchor the agents to the cell membrane and increase their activity against Gram-positive cocci. In addition to inhibiting cell wall synthesis, telavancin and oritavancin are also able to disrupt bacterial membrane integrity and increase membrane permeability; oritavancin also inhibits RNA synthesis. Enterococci exhibiting the VanA phenotype (resistance to both vancomycin and teicoplanin) are resistant to both dalbavancin and telavancin, while oritavancin retains activity. Dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin exhibit activity against VanB vancomycin-resistant enterococci. All three lipoglycopeptides demonstrate potent in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis regardless of their susceptibility to meticillin, as well as Streptococcus spp. Both dalbavancin and telavancin are active against vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), but display poor activity versus vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA). Oritavancin is active against both VISA and VRSA. Telavancin displays greater activity against Clostridium spp. than dalbavancin, oritavancin or vancomycin. The half-life of dalbavancin ranges from 147 to 258 hours, which allows for once-weekly dosing, the half-life of oritavancin of 393 hours may allow for one dose per treatment course, while telavancin requires daily administration. Dalbavancin and telavancin exhibit concentration-dependent activity and AUC/MIC (area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio) is the pharmacodynamic parameter that best describes their activities. Oritavancin's activity is also considered concentration-dependent in vitro, while in vivo its activity has been described by both concentration and time-dependent models; however, AUC/MIC is the pharmacodynamic parameter that best describes its activity. Clinical trials involving patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) have demonstrated that all three agents are as efficacious as comparators. The most common adverse effects reported with dalbavancin use included nausea, diarrhoea and constipation, while injection site reactions, fever and diarrhoea were commonly observed with oritavancin therapy. Patients administered telavancin frequently reported nausea, taste disturbance and insomnia. To date, no drug-drug interactions have been identified for dalbavancin, oritavancin or telavancin. All three of these agents are promising alternatives for the treatment of cSSSIs in cases where more economical options such as vancomycin have been ineffective, in cases of reduced vancomycin susceptibility or resistance, or where vancomycin use has been associated with adverse events.
TI  - Drug susceptibility and clonality of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in hospitalized patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clonal relatedness and drug susceptibility of Streptococcus epidermidis isolated from hematological patients. METHODS: All S. epidermidis isolated from hematological patients who developed bloodstream infections between June 2005 and December 2007 were included. The clonal relationship was tested by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) isolates were examined from patients' blood culture samples. Two subgroups that differed approximately by 40% in their PFGE banding were identified. In clinical practice, two cases were cured with cephalosporin only, thus demonstrating sensitivity of the strains to beta-lactam antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent two significant findings. One is the major capability of MRSE to colonize patients. The other is that some MRSE isolates proved to be sensitive to clindamycin, minocycline, and cephalosporin, so that using antibiotics to which MRSE is sensitive as first-line therapy can avoid the need for vancomycin in clinical settings.
TI  - A survey of veterinary hospitals in Nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the Sokoto metropolis of north-western Nigeria. A total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. Bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: Bacillus sp. (27.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), Listeria sp. (13.6%), Streptococcus sp. (11.4%), Salmonella sp. (6.8%), Escherichia coli (4.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), Citrobacter sp. (2.3%), Klebsiella sp. (2.3%), Lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), Micrococcus sp. (2.3%), Pasteurella sp. (2.3%), Proteus sp. (2.3%), and Yersinia sp. (2.3%). A higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. Some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. In this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the Sokoto region of north-western Nigeria. Of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in Nigeria. It was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.
TI  - Microbiology and visual outcome of bleb-associated endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the microbiological spectrum and visual outcome of bleb-associated endophthalmitis. METHODS: The medical records of patients treated for bleb-associated endophthalmitis were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were identified. Vitreous cultures were positive in 48 (64%) patients. The most common isolates were Streptococcus species in 24 (50%) eyes, gram-negative bacteria in 10 (20.8%) eyes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 7 (14.6%) eyes. Good visual outcome was achieved in 33 (44%) patients. On univariate analysis, shorter interval from onset of symptoms and treatment (p = .005), better initial visual acuity (p = .004), clear cornea at presentation (p = .048), isolation of less virulent organisms (p < .001), and absence of diabetes mellitus (p = .048) were significant positive predictors for good visual outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Bleb-associated endophthalmitis is associated with severe visual impairment. Clinical features associated with better visual outcome include early presentation, better presenting visual acuity, clear cornea at presentation, culture of a less virulent organism, and absence of diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Changing patterns of blood borne sepsis in special care baby unit, khoula hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infection is a frequent and important cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal units all over the world. Over the years, there has been a shift in the microorganisms responsible for neonatal septicemia. This study aims to analyze the changing patterns of blood borne organisms in the neonatal unit. METHODS: This retrospective study was undertaken at the neonatal intensive care unit of Khoula Hospital in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman to analyze the incidence of blood borne sepsis and its changing pattern from 1997-2000. RESULTS: Out of a total 2181 admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, 71 (3.25%) babies had positive blood culture. A reduction in the incidence of blood borne sepsis with changing patterns of organisms was seen over the period of four years with incidence of Group B Streptococcus declining from 34% in 1997-1998 to 17.8% in 1999-2000 and the incidence of CONS (Staphylococcus epidermidis) increasing from 20% in 1997-1998 to 35% in 1999-2000. CONCLUSION: Overall, due to survival and prolonged hospitalization of extremely low birth weight babies who need frequent invasive procedures, and the use of powerful antibiotics, the incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis which was previously thought to be non pathogenic has increased over the years in neonatal intensive care units.
TI  - Common wound colonizers in patients with epidermolysis bullosa.
AB  - One of the major morbidities of patients with epidermolysis bullosa is the tendency to develop chronic wounds, which predisposes them to multiple complications including life-threatening infections, failure to thrive, and squamous cell carcinomas. Chronic wounds frequently become colonized with bacteria, and we sought to identify the most common microorganisms isolated on cultures from patients with epidermolysis bullosa. We conducted a retrospective review of positive wound, nasal, and blood cultures, including bacterial, fungal and viral, in 30 patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., diptheroids, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida sp. were the most commonly isolated microorganisms in wound cultures from our epidermolysis bullosa patients. Two patients had viral cultures that grew herpes simplex virus type-1. Bacterial colonization of chronic wounds can lead to infections and may also impact wound healing. Results from this study provide data on which to base empiric antibiotic choice in patients with epidermolysis bullosa when needed and may be useful in planning strategies for decolonization and improved wound healing in this population.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of compounds from the isodon species].
AB  - We investigated antibacterial activities of ten compounds from Isodon species against five strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus mutans, and Helicobacter pylori. The compounds with the MIC values of 25 microg/ml were isodocarpin against Sta. epidermidis, Str. mutans, and H. pylori, nodosin against Sta. epidermidis and Str. mutans, oridonin against Ser. marcescens, and pedalitin against H. pylori.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of a biosurfactant isolated from Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei A20 against several micro-organisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities were determined using the microdilution method in 96-well culture plates. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against all the micro-organisms assayed, and for twelve of the eighteen micro-organisms (including the pathogenic Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were achieved for biosurfactant concentrations between 25 and 50 mg ml(-1). Furthermore, the biosurfactant showed antiadhesive activity against most of the micro-organisms evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities of biosurfactants obtained from lactobacilli against such a broad group of micro-organisms. Although the antiadhesive activity of biosurfactants isolated from lactic acid bacteria has been widely reported, their antimicrobial activity is quite unusual and has been described only in a few strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained in this study regarding the antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of this biosurfactant opens future prospects for its use against micro-organisms responsible for diseases and infections in the urinary, vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in the skin, making it a suitable alternative to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - CEM-101 activity against Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CEM-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against Gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. Experiments for determination of the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (PAE), and drug interactions were performed for CEM-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. The MBCs of CEM-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and CEM-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. Timed-killing curve testing showed that CEM-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-CFU/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. The propensity of CEM-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). In multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were USA300 isolates) resistant to CEM-101 emerged. That number was comparable to the number resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. Erythromycin induced CEM-101 resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, CEM-101 resistance induction was not observed. CEM-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent PAE against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for Gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). No antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with CEM-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Overall, this new antimicrobial agent (CEM-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that CEM-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.
TI  - Speciation of Gram-positive bacteria in fresh and ambient-stored sub-tropical marine fish.
AB  - This study identified Gram-positive bacteria in three sub-tropical marine fish species; Pseudocaranx dentex (silver trevally), Pagrus auratus (snapper) and Mugil cephalus (sea mullet). It further elucidated the role played by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage on the composition of the Gram-positive bacteria. A total of 266 isolates of Gram-positive bacteria were identified by conventional biochemical methods, VITEK, PCR using genus- and species-specific primers and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolates were found to fall into 13 genera and 30 species. In fresh fish, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus were the most frequent isolates. After ambient storage, S. epidermidis, S. xylosus and Bacillus megaterium were no longer present whereas S. warneri, B. sphaericus, Brevibacillus borstelensis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus uberis increased in frequency. Micrococcus luteus and S. warneri were the most prevalent isolates from P. dentex, while E. faecium and Strep. uberis were the most frequent isolates from P. auratus and M. cephalus. With respect to different parts of the fish body, E. faecium, Strep. uberis and B. sphaericus were the most frequent isolates from the muscles, E. faecium, Strep. uberis from the gills and M. luteus from the gut. This study showed a diversity of Gram-positive bacteria in sub-tropical marine fish; however, their abundance was affected by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis antimicrobial delta-toxin (phenol-soluble modulin-gamma) cooperates with host antimicrobial peptides to kill group A Streptococcus.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in host defense against pathogens.  Recently, phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) were shown to interact with lipid membranes, form complexes, and exert antimicrobial activity. Based on the abundance and innocuity of the cutaneous resident S. epidermidis, we hypothesized that their PSMs contribute to host defense. Here we show that S. epidermidis delta-toxin (PSMgamma) is normally present in the epidermis and sparsely in the dermis of human skin using immunohistochemistry. Synthetic delta-toxin interacted with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and colocalized with cathelicidin while also inducing NET formation in human neutrophils. In antimicrobial assays against Group A Streptococcus (GAS), delta-toxin cooperated with CRAMP, hBD2, and hBD3. In whole blood, addition of delta-toxin exerted a bacteriostatic effect on GAS, and in NETs, delta-toxin increased their killing capacity against this pathogen. Coimmunoprecipitation and tryptophan spectroscopy demonstrated direct binding of delta-toxin to host antimicrobial peptides LL-37, CRAMP, hBD2, and hBD3. Finally, in a mouse wound model, GAS survival was reduced (along with Mip-2 cytokine levels) when the wounds were pretreated with delta-toxin. Thus, these data suggest that S. epidermidis-derived delta-toxin cooperates with the host-derived antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune system to reduce survival of an important human bacterial pathogen.
TI  - [Antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections of the central nervous system].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of antimicrobial treatment of infections in the central nervous system (CNS) is to eradicate the bacterial cause. The choice of antibiotics should take into account its activity, pharmacokinetic properties, results of clinical trials, side effects and total treatment cost. Despite the fact that pharmacokinetics affects the ability of antibiotics to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) significantly, the most important factor is that meningeal inflammation increases the permeability barrier. The selected antibiotic should have a bactericidal action and the achieved liquor concentration should be high above the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY: Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started immediate after taking the sample to make the etiological diagnosis, taking into account the patient ' age. previous diseases and immune status. The specific or targeted antibiotic treatment is carried out according to the microbiological sensitivity test of antimicrobial agents isolated. Whenever possible, the preference should be given to a monotherapy except when it comes to a cause requiring synergistic combination of antibiotics. The length of treatment is individually assessed and is mainly based on experience. Numerous studies have shown that it is possible to reduce inflammatory response in subarachnoid space and thus improve the outcome of meningitis by using anti-inflammatory agents, along with the antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Today the increase in resistance to antibiotics is a leading medical problem in the 21st century. The most common micro organisms isolated from CSF (liquor) in our region are: Staphylococcus spp. coagulase negative. Haemophilus infuenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, serogroup B. Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus beta haemoliticus. The resistance to antimicrobial drugs most frequently used in the treatment of bacterial meningitis is still not alarmingly. high in our country. Since there is a real possibility of development of high resistance in our area, the main recommendation is to rationalize the use of antibiotics.
TI  - Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6%.
AB  - Besifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone that, like other fluoroquinolones, acts by inhibiting the essential bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topical besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% is indicated for use in patients with bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria. Besifloxacin had in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria that commonly cause ocular infections (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae), including drug-resistant strains. In two randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% administered at the recommended dose for 5 days in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than vehicle in terms of clinical resolution and microbial eradication rates (coprimary endpoints) at study visit two (day 5+/-1) or three (day 8 or 9) [primary timepoints]. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was noninferior to moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% in patients aged > or =1 year with bacterial conjunctivitis with regard to clinical resolution (58.3% vs 59.4%) and microbial eradication (93.3% vs 91.1%) rates on day 5 +/- 1 of treatment (coprimary endpoints) in a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial; both drugs were administered at a dosage of one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily for 5 days. Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with most adverse events being mild in severity. The tolerability profile of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was similar to that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%.
TI  - [Problem of infections at ENT Department of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections at ENT wards constitute an essential clinical, organizational and economic issue. AIM: The purpose of this work was to present the problem of infections at ENT Clinic of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2006-2007 in The Department of Otolaryngology in Poznan there were treated 7052 patients. During that time 476 biological samples were taken to carry out a bacteriological examination. They came from: 74 postoperative wounds, 43 tracheotomy areas, 29 tracheoesophageal fistulas, 9 salivary fistulas, 105 ears, 71 noses, pharynxes and oral cavities, 44 body fluids, 18 paranasal sinuses, 11 central venous catheter areas, 23 urine samples, some constituted BAL, sputum, cyst content, materials from decubitus ulcer and gastrostomies areas. 21 materials were taken from abscesses and phlegmons, 32 from patients with purulent complications of chronic otitis media, 18 from patients with complications of chronic sinusitis and in 1 case there was taken in hospital conditions peritonsillar abscess content. RESULTS: 119 biological samples were aseptic, in 43 samples there were no pathological cultures, in 314 samples pathological bacterial flora was found. The most often isolated pathogens constituted: in postoperative wounds-Staphylococcus epidermidis, in tracheotomy areas-Enterococcus faecalis, in tracheoesophagal fistulas-Streptococcus viridans, in ears-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in materials from noses, pharynxes and oral cavities-Staphylococcus aureus, while in materials from abscesses, paranasal sinuses and central venous catheter areas-Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: All cases were analyzed in detail. There was made a correlation between isolated pathogens and: a kind of pathology, surgical procedure, general patient condition, length of hospitalization.
TI  - Purulent thyroiditis--a clinical study of 5 cases.
AB  - Between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2006, 13,279 patients were operated on due to various forms of goitre, of which five cases were diagnosed with purulent thyroiditis--one child aged 8, three women and one man all between 35 and 81 years of age. The course of the disease was unusual. In three of the patients cancer was suspected. In all of the patients hard nodules were discovered within the thyroid gland, ultrasonographically heterogeneous and hypo-echogenic, although scintigraphic examination showed "cold" nodules. The child presented regional lymph node enlargement. Except in one case, all patients were apyretic. The rapid growth of the thyroid gland and symptoms of compression were observed in 2 cases. In one of them, tracheostomy was required. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland revealed the presence of profuse purulent infiltration in one case. Neither thyroid dysfunction nor autoimmune changes were detected. A subtotal thyroidectomy was performed in all patients. In the paediatric case, the enlarged lymph nodes were also resected. In 3 cases, thyroid abscess was diagnosed and drained and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes were found. Microscopic examination proved the presence of aspergillus fumigatus in one case. Antibiotic therapy was applied postoperatively and all the patients recovered. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The clinical course of purulent thyroiditis leads to a diagnostic challenge. The surgical treatment of purulent thyroiditis allows for a faster recovery for the patient.
TI  - Evaluation of safety for bilateral same-day intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the incidence of complications after bilateral same-day intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapies in this retrospective interventional case series. METHODS: An electronic review of billing records was performed to identify all bilateral same-day intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections performed within a single group retina practice between January 6, 2006 and June 1, 2009. The charts were reviewed to identify the complications of endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, retinal tear, and retinal detachment. RESULTS: A total of 1,534 bilateral intravitreal injections (326 bevacizumab and 1,208 ranibizumab: 3,068 injections total) were performed in 367 patients. Three complications were identified. Two cases of unilateral culture-proven endophthalmitis occurred after bilateral intravitreal ranibizumab, and one case of unilateral acute intraocular inflammation occurred after bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab. In all three of these eyes, visual acuity returned to its preinjection level. No cases of retinal tear or retinal detachment were identified. The incidence of culture-proven endophthalmitis was 0.065%, and the incidence of acute intraocular inflammation was 0.033%. CONCLUSION: The complication rates after bilateral same-day intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections seem to be similar to those after unilateral injections. Severe acute intraocular inflammation can occur unilaterally after same-day bilateral injections of bevacizumab.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis in Northern  India and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. METHODS: Laboratory records of all consecutive cases of clinically suspected bacterial corneal ulcers were retrospectively reviewed. Data noted included microorganism isolated and antibiotic culture sensitivity to cefazolin, tobramycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. In vitro susceptibility toward individual antibiotics was determined and compared with the potential in vitro susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin, cefazolin-gatifloxacin, and cefazolin-moxifloxacin combinations. RESULTS: A total of 292 bacterial isolates were identified. Of these, 255 (87.3%) were Gram-positive and 37 (12.7%) were Gram-negative. Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=227, 77.7%) was the most common organism. Overall susceptibility of isolates was 95.52% to gatifloxacin, 92.83% to moxifloxacin, 90.07% to tobramycin, and 83.56% to cefazolin (p<0.000). Organisms which showed resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were comparable with each other (p=0.312) and with potential susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin (p=0.479), gatifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.134), and moxifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.412) combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin can be an effective alternative to cefazolin-tobramycin combination as a first-line empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis. The addition of cefazolin to a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is of limited value.
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  - The seventh year of the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against Gram-positive pathogens in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.
TI  - Linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (LEADER Program for 2008).
AB  - The LEADER Program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers. This report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. A total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 856), enterococci (901), Streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). Only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The nonsusceptible strains (22) were Staphylococcus aureus (3), CoNS (14), and Enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (G2576T in 19 strains; T2504A in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain Staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in LEADER 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. The mobile cfr resistance found in a Staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility levels). The nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. However, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the S. epidermidis strain. The LEADER Program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich Rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
AB  - Rhinacanthins-rich Rhinacanthus nasutus (RRn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. In this study, antimicrobial activities of the RRn extract as well as rhinacanthin-C against Streptococcus mutans, Propionibacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. It was found that the RRn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against S. mutans with MIC and MBC of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against S. epidermidis, P. acnes and S. aureus with the MICs of 8-16 microg/ml. However, the RRn extract was not active against C. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activities of the RRn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-C. Stability evaluations of the RRn extract through a period of 4 months found that the RRn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees C or 30+/-2 degrees C. The RRn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. Under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees C with 75% relative humidity, the RRn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. Study on the effect of pH on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the RRn extract found that the solutions were not stable at pH 5.5, pH 7.0, and pH 8.0. However, the rhinacanthin solution at pH 5.5 was more stable than those at pH 7.0 and pH 8.0.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Bacteriological profile and antimicrobial resistance patterns of clinical bacterial isolates in a University Hospital.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the patterns of bacterial isolates found in blood culture of patients with bactermia in King Abdul Aziz University Hospital in addition to determination of antibiotic resistance. A retrospective analysis of the 672 positive samples collected over the period of December 2006-December 2008. The observed mean age was 40 years with comparable distribution in both genders. 65.2% of the population were Non-Saudi. 65.5% of isolates were Gram positive, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis, on the other hand Klebsiella was the common Gram negative bacteria. Diabetes has been observed in 38.5%. Mortality was 32.4 (P-value 0.001) in diabetic patients versus non-diabetics. Benzyl penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, oxacillin caused resistance to more than 50% of Gram positive organisms whereas antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, levofloxacin, piperacillin, cefuroxime and cefuroxime was found in Gram negative isolates. To conclude vancomycin, teicoplanin, linizolid, and piperacillin/tazobactam, were effective antimicrobial agents against the majority of bacterial isolates. Gram positive organisms are the common cause of bactermia. The highest risk of mortality is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - [Etiology, resistance and diagnostic techniques in skin and skin structure infections].
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are common and, generally, uncomplicated at the time of initial presentation. However, these infections can worsen quickly when there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. The clinical presentation of most SSTI is the culmination of a microbial three-step process as follow: i) bacterial adherence to host cells; ii) invasion of tissue with evasion of host defences, and iii) elaboration of toxins. Even if the microbiology of wounds has been actively investigated in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the microbial mechanisms that induce infection and prevent wound healing. There are also several means by which bacteria penetrate the skin barrier. The most common route is through a break in the barrier (lacerations, bite wounds, scratches, instrumentations, pre-existing skin conditions, wounds or ulcers, burns and surgery); other routes of penetration include contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g. osteomyelitis), entry of water into the skin pores, and, rarely, haematogenous seeding (i.e septic emboli). From what it was said, many microorganisms, above all from the normal skin microbiota, can be involved in these often polymicrobial infections, with Gram-positives such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp being predominant. Many other aerobic and anaerobic species, including Gram-negative bacilli, can also be involved. Even if the diagnosis of most SSTI is based on clinical examination, laboratory investigations, guided by clinical information, can help to confirm the diagnosis and elucidate the characteristics of specific pathogens. These microbiological investigations may include blood cultures, tissue swabs with culture, and needle aspiration. In rapidly progressing infections, empirical therapy is essential, although microbiological data are important in confirming subsequently that the chosen regimen is appropriate. Furthermore, the number of microorganisms becoming resistant to many usual drugs and the changing microbial epidemiology of these infections, such as the emergence of CA-MRSA, required a constant cooperation between the microbiology lab and the clinician in order to address microbiological aspects that can be critical to the successful management of SSTI.
TI  - Selective antimicrobial action is provided by phenol-soluble modulins derived from Staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal resident of the skin.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of innate immune defense against invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses. In this study, we hypothesized that peptides produced by a normal microbial resident of human skin, Staphylococcus epidermidis, might also act as an antimicrobial shield and contribute to normal defense at the epidermal interface. We show by circular dichroism and tryptophan spectroscopy that phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) gamma and delta produced by S. epidermidis have an alpha-helical character and a strong lipid membrane interaction similar to mammalian AMPs such as LL-37. Both PSMs directly induced lipid vesicle leakage and exerted selective antimicrobial action against skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. PSMs functionally cooperated with each other and LL-37 to enhance antimicrobial action. Moreover, PSMs reduced Group A Streptococcus (GAS) but not the survival of S. epidermidis on mouse skin. Thus, these data suggest that the production of PSMgamma and PSMdelta by S. epidermidis can benefit cutaneous immune defense by selectively inhibiting the survival of skin pathogens while maintaining the normal skin microbiome.
TI  - Simultaneous surgery of the aortic valve and sternal osteomyelitis.
AB  - A 64-year-old man was referred for aortic valve replacement due to severe stenosis. He also suffered chronic sternal osteomyelitis with skin fistula subsequent to radiation therapy. Both pathologies were approached simultaneously by sternal resection, omental plasty, and valve replacement, which led to favorable primary and mid-term result.
TI  - Distribution of bacterial keratitis and emerging resistance to antibiotics in China from 2001 to 2004.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study on the distribution of bacterial keratitis isolates and the resistance to antibiotics in China from 2001 to 2004. METHODS: 1985 specimens from the bacterial keratitis at the Beijing Tong Ren Eye Center were cultured and identified. In vitro susceptibility testing of positive isolates to antibiotics was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Out of 1985 specimens, 279 were culture positive. The percentage of positive culture was 14.06%. Gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli represented 42.65% (119/270) and 35.13% (98/279) respectively. Pseudomonas sp. was the most common organism (20.07%), followed by Corynebacterium sp.(16.85%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (13.98%). Resistance to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and tobramycin was 20.2%, 35.9%, 15.5%, and 29.4% respectively. Gram-negative bacilli showed higher resistance to ciprofloxacin. Staphycoccus sp. revealed significant resistance to ciprofloxacin. Streptococcus sp. showed high resistance to tobramycin. The resistance of isolates from older patients (>/=60Y) to ciproloxacin, levofloxacin, and tobramycin was higher than that from adult patients (>14 to 59Y). CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Corynebacterium sp. were the most common bacterial keratitis isolates in China. Attentions should be paid to the increase of the resistance to levofloxacin.
TI  - Clinical course and predictors of death in prosthetic valve endocarditis over a 20-year period.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare early and late outcome of patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis treated medically versus surgically and to determine predictors of in-hospital death. We retrospectively reviewed patient's clinical records, including laboratory findings, surgery, and pathologic files, in an acute-care, 1200-bed teaching hospital. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three episodes of definite prosthetic valve endocarditis as defined by the Duke University diagnostic criteria occurred in 122 patients from January 1986 to December 2005. Logistic regression model was used to identify prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Long-term follow-up was made to assess late prognosis. RESULTS: Bioprostheses were involved in 52% of cases and mechanical valves in 48%. The aortic valve was affected in 45% of patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 23% of cases, Streptococcus spp in 21%, S aureus in 13%, and Enterococcus in 8%. Cultures were negative in 18% of cases. Twenty-six patients were treated medically and 107 with combined antibiotics and valve replacement. The operative mortality was 6.5% and the in-hospital mortality, 29%. Presence of an abscess at echocardiography, urgent surgical treatment, heart failure, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure were significant predictors of in-hospital death. Kaplan-Meier survival at 12 months was 42% in patients treated medically and 71% in those treated surgically (P = .0007). Freedom from endocarditis was 91% at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Prosthetic valve endocarditis is a serious condition with high mortality. Patients with perivalvular abscess had a worse prognosis, and combined surgical and medical treatment could be the preferred approach to improve outcome.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% compared with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% for treating bacterial conjunctivitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical and antimicrobial efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% with that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled, noninferiority study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 1 year of age or older with clinical manifestations of bacterial conjunctivitis. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to either besifloxacin suspension or moxifloxacin solution, instilled in the infected eye(s) 3 times daily for 5 days, and participated in study visits on days 1, 5 (+/-1 day), and 8 (+1 day). Assessments included clinical evaluation of signs and symptoms, visual acuity, biomicroscopy, and culture of the infected eye(s) at each visit, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy on days 1 and 8. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy end points were clinical resolution and microbial eradication of baseline bacterial infection on day 5 in patients with culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis. Secondary end points included clinical resolution and microbial eradication on day 8, individual clinical outcomes, microbial and clinical outcomes by bacterial species, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 1161 patients (533 with culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis) were randomized. Based on the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference, besifloxacin was noninferior to moxifloxacin for clinical resolution on day 5 (58.3% vs. 59.4%, respectively; 95% CI, -9.48 to 7.29) and day 8 (84.5% vs. 84.0%, respectively, 95% CI, -5.6% to 6.75%) and for microbial eradication on day 5 (93.3% vs. 91.1%, respectively, 95% CI, -2.44 to 6.74) and day 8 (87.3% vs. 84.7%; 95% CI, -3.32 to 8.53). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups for either efficacy end points on days 5 or 8 (P>0.05). Besifloxacin and moxifloxacin were well tolerated. The cumulative frequency of ocular adverse events was similar between treatments (12% and 14% with besifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively). However, eye irritation occurred more often in moxifloxacin-treated eyes (0.3% for besifloxacin vs. 1.4% for moxifloxacin; P = 0.0201). CONCLUSIONS: Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension was non inferior to moxifloxacin ophthalmic suspension and provided similar safety and efficacy (clinical and microbiological) outcomes when used for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  - [Investigation of the situation of vaginal microflora in healthy women population].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the distribution of vaginal microflora in healthy women and  investigate their cognition of lower reproductive tract infection-related knowledge as well as personal hygiene habits and character of behavior in seeking medical treatment. METHODS: Total of 1660 healthy women who had physical check-ups at the Medical Center of Renji Hospital were selected and received gynecologic examination, as well as routine examination, pH examination and bacterial culture of the vaginal discharge. In addition, 860 of them were randomly selected for questionnaire survey, in which reproductive tract infection -related knowledge and personal hygiene habits as well as behavior in seeking medical treatment were involved. RESULTS: Among the 1660 censused women, vaginal average pH was 4. 16 +/- 0.21. The positive rate of Candida in vaginal discharge routine examination was 3.86% (64/1660), which was lower than that in aerobes culture 7.71% (128/1660). Candida albicans was the most populous species 78.9% (101/128), followed by 7.8% (10/128) and 7.0% (9/128) for the Candida glabrata and Candida krusei respectively. The most populous species of vaginal microflora were hemolytic streptococcus A (63.80%, 1059/1660), Staphylococcus epidermidis (14.28%, 237/1660), and Enterococcus faecalis (D) group (11.44%, 190/1660). The questionnaire survey showed that 88.4% (760/860) of 860 women took active treatment when feeling unwell, 92.1% (792/860) of them had good hygiene practices, and only 21.2% (182/860) had the habit of vaginal douching. In addition, 50.0% (430/860) of them had the desire to obtain reproductive health knowledge through out-patient consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Vulvovaginal Candida disease ranks the first in all types of vaginitis, among which, Candida albicans is the most populous species followed by the Candida glabrata and Candida krusei. Hemolytic streptococcus A and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common species of vaginal microflora in healthy women. The censused women have high awareness of reproductive health care and pay much attention to common gynecologic diseases such as lower reproductive tract infection. Nevertheless, we should strengthen the public education of reproductive health-related knowledge.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against MRSA and MRSE.
AB  - Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. This report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous Ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus. The bioreduction of the Ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Combining use of a panel of ssDNA aptamers in the detection of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this article, a panel of ssDNA aptamers specific to Staphylococcus aureus was  obtained by a whole bacterium-based SELEX procedure and applied to probing S. aureus. After several rounds of selection with S. aureus as the target and Streptococcus and S. epidermidis as counter targets, the highly enriched oligonucleic acid pool was sequenced and then grouped under different families on the basis of the homology of the primary sequence and the similarity of the secondary structure. Eleven sequences from different families were selected for further characterization by confocal imaging and flow cytometry analysis. Results showed that five aptamers demonstrated high specificity and affinity to S. aureus individually. The five aptamers recognize different molecular targets by competitive experiment. Combining these five aptamers had a much better effect than the individual aptamer in the recognition of different S. aureus strains. In addition, the combined aptamers can probe single S. aureus in pyogenic fluids. Our work demonstrates that a set of aptamers specific to one bacterium can be used in combination for the identification of the bacterium instead of a single aptamer.
TI  - Ocular pharmacokinetics of besifloxacin following topical administration to rabbits, monkeys, and humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies were conducted to evaluate the ocular penetration and systemic exposure to besifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, following topical ocular administration to animals and humans. METHODS: Besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension (0.6%) was administered as a topical ocular instillation to pigmented rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and human subjects. At predetermined intervals after dosing, samples of ocular tissues and plasma were collected and analyzed for besifloxacin levels using HPLC/MS/MS methods. RESULTS: Besifloxacin demonstrated good ocular penetration in rabbits and monkeys, with rapid absorption and sustained concentrations observed in anterior ocular tissues through 24 h after a single administration. Maximum besifloxacin concentrations in conjunctiva, cornea, and aqueous humor of monkeys were 6.43 microg/g, 2.10 microg/g, and 0.796 microg/mL, respectively, after a single topical dose, and concentrations declined in these tissues with an apparent half-life of 5-14 h. Following a single topical ocular administration to humans, the maximum besifloxacin concentration in tears was 610 microg/g with concentrations decreasing to approximately 1.6 microg/g at 24 h. The resulting pharmacokinetic parameters for besifloxacin in human tears were evaluated relative to the MIC(90) values (microg/mL) for besifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.125), Staphylococcus aureus (0.25), Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.5), and Haemophilus influenzae (0.06). Following a single topical administration, the C(max)/MIC(90) ratios for besifloxacin in human tears were > or =1,220, and the AUC((0-24))/MIC(90) ratios were > or =2,500 for these relevant ocular pathogens. Following repeated 3-times daily (TID) topical ocular administration to human subjects with clinically diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis, maximum besifloxacin concentrations in plasma were less than 0.5 ng/mL, on average. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of the current investigation provide a PK/PD-based rationale that supports the use of besifloxacin for the safe and effective treatment of ocular infections.
TI  - [An eight-year review of sensitivity to antimicrobials against isolated microorganisms from ocular infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain data beneficial for future treatment by observing the circumstances relating to microorganisms isolated in external ocular infections and drug sensitivity, along with changes in drug-resistant bacteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: For an eight-year period from April 1998 to March 2006, the cultivation and identification of secretions from conjunctival sac and drug sensitivity tests were conducted at JA Gifu Koseiren Chuno General Hospital involving 3,876 patients (1,809 males and 2,067 females; average age: 44.2 +/- 29.3 years old, ranging from 0-99 years old) diagnosed with external ocular infections by the Department of Ophthalmology. Sensitivity test results were evaluated based on the US CLSI standards. RESULTS: Of the 5,002 samples, 3,447 tested positive for cultures (isolation rate: 68.9%). A total of 4,537 strains were isolated. In descending order, the microorganisms isolated were 1,706 strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS), including Staphylococcus epidermidis (37.6%), 936 strains of Corynebacterium spp. (20.6%), 635 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), 412 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), and 246 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.4%). CNS, Corynebacterium and S. aureus were isolated in relatively large numbers in patients of all ages. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were common in children six and under and from winter to spring. At the sametime, resistant bacteria (PRSP or PISP: 166 strains; 2000 onward, BLNAR: 192 strains; and BLPACR: 6 strains) were detected more frequently than sensitive bacteria. H. influenzae was hypersensitive to cefotaxime (CTX) and levofloxacin. Almost no toleration of CTX was observed in S. pneumoniae. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: There are distinctions in the isolated bacteria according to age and season, and the use of drugs that are appropriate to the antibiograms of each facility should be considered.
TI  - AFN-1252, a FabI inhibitor, demonstrates a Staphylococcus-specific spectrum of activity.
AB  - AFN-1252, a potent inhibitor of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI), inhibited all clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 502) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 51) tested, including methicillin (meticillin)-resistant isolates, at concentrations of <or=0.12 microg/ml. In contrast, AFN-1252 was inactive (MIC(90), >4 microg/ml) against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These data support the continued development of AFN-1252 for the treatment of patients with resistant staphylococcal infections.
TI  - [Mutant prevention concentrations of antibacterial agents to ocular pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to measure mutant prevention concentration (MPC) in vitro, and to measure MPC of antibacterial agents for ocular bacteria caused keratitis. METHODS: It was an experimental study. Forty strains of ocular bacteria were separated from cornea in Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, which included 8 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the levofloxacin (LVF), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NFL), tobramycin (TOB) and chloromycetin (CHL) were determined by agar dilution method from National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS). The MPC were measured by accumulate-bacterial methods with bacterial population inoculated more than 1.2 x 10(10) colony forming units per milliliter with Mueller-Hinton broth and tryptic soy agar plate. With the software of SPSS 11.0, the datum such as the range of MIC, MPC, MIC90 and MPC90 were calculated, and the selection index (MPC90/ MI90) and mutant selection window (MSW) were obtained. RESULTS: The MI90 of LVF and TOB (4 mg/L) to Staphylococcus aureus strains were the lowest. CIP showed the lowest MIC90 (0.25 mg/L) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa among six kinds of antibacterial agents. The MIC90 of LVF to Staphylococcus epidermidis (256 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L) were lower than other antibacterial agents. The MPC90, MSW and the MPC90/MIC90 of levofloxacin showed lower values compared with other antibacterial medicines. From all the datum, the MIC90 of CHL was the highest and the activity was the weakest. Although the activity of LVF was higher to every kind of bacteria, CIP had the highest activity antibacterial to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The capacity of CHL and TOB was weaker than Quinolones for restricting resistant mutants on ocular bacteria. LVF had the strongest capacity for restricting resistant mutants among Quinolones. CONCLUSION: LVF has better antibacterial effects and stronger capacity for restricting the selection of resistant mutants on ocular bacteria than other antibacterial agents.
TI  - Prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in Gram-positive cocci isolated in Tunisian Bone Marrow Transplant Center.
AB  - To investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics in Gram-positive cocci isolated in a Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. These three groups of organisms were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. The resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive MLS resistance. In order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (A), erm(B), erm(C), msr(A) and macrolide efflux (mef) (A) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermB in E. faecium (80%), ermC in S. epidermidis (53%) and mefA in S. mitis (65%).
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. All of the title compounds have considerable activity against the twelve strains, and exhibit exceptional potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.06-8 microg/mL). The most active compound 17 is 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, 32-fold more potent than levofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 16-fold more potent than IMB against K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  - Dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the Indian scenario.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. The bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.
TI  - Late-onset laser in situ keratomileusis-related corneal ulcer--a case series.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report 4 cases of flap margin-related corneal ulcer that developed 5  years after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedures. METHODS: We retrospectively documented the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients between 2004 and 2008 who presented with LASIK-related corneal ulcer that appeared >5 years postoperatively. The 4 patients who had this condition were 25-, 33-, 61-, and 62-year-old males. RESULTS: Two patients had cultures positive to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermidis. Two ulcers healed after standard fortified topical antibiotic regimen, 1 ulcer healed after treatment with moxifloxacin, and the fourth healed after treatment with lomefloxacin. All cases presented 5 years after the LASIK procedure. CONCLUSIONS: LASIK procedures can be associated with the risk of corneal infection even years later. The mechanism may be flap margin instability causing epithelial defense barrier disturbance.
TI  - Prevalence, intensity and identity of bacteraemia following conservative dental procedures in children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, intensity  and microbial identity of bacteraemia following conservative dental procedures. The procedures were placement of rubber dam, use of the fast drill, use of the slow drill and placement of a matrix band and wedge. METHOD: Two hundred and five children and adolescents undergoing general anaesthesia for dental treatment at the Eastman Dental Hospital were recruited. Each subject was randomly allocated to one of the procedure groups. A baseline blood sample was taken before any dental treatment was carried out. A second blood sample was taken 30 s after a single conservative procedure. The blood samples were processed using lysis filtration. All bacterial isolates were identified using comparative 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Oral Streptococcus spp. and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were further identified by comparative sodA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The prevalence of bacteraemia was significantly greater following placement of rubber dam (P = 0.01) and placement of matrix band and wedge, compared with baseline. The intensity of bacteraemia was significantly greater following placement of rubber dam (P = 0.001) and placement of matrix band and wedge (P = 0.0001). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus spp. (56%), Actinomyces spp. (15%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (15%). CONCLUSION: Conservative dental procedures are a significant cause of bacteraemia.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Neonatal cord blood subsets and cytokine response to bacterial antigens.
AB  - We compared lymphocyte subsets and cytokine responses to bacteria among term, preterm infants, and adults. Lymphocyte subset percentages in cord blood (22 preterm, 27 term neonates) and peripheral blood from 21 adults and cytokine/chemokine interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon gamma (IFN gamma) responses to Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp299v) were assessed by flow cytometry. Preterm compared with term infants had increased CD8 (+) T cells (p = 0.02) and reduced naive CD4 (+) T cells (p < 0.0001). Memory T and natural killer (NK) T cells were reduced (p < 0.001) in neonates; NK and CD56 (+)161 (+) NK cells were increased (p < 0.001). CD56 (+)CD8 (+) NK cells were higher in preterm compared with term infants. Despite individual exceptions, cytokine responses in neonates were weaker than adults except for IL-8 response to E. coli in preterm and IL-12 response to Lp299v in term infants. IL-10 responses were weaker in preterm (p = 0.01) and term (p = 0.005) infants to S. epidermidis and to E. coli (p = 0.03 for both) compared with adults. Differences in regulatory subpopulations of NK and T cells between neonates and adults and term compared with preterm infants were observed. These differences rather than intrinsic functional deficiency may account for neonatal cytokine responses to bacteria.
TI  - Rate of bacterial eradication by ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibacterial activity of ophthalmic fourth-generation fluoroquinolones has traditionally been evaluated by comparing only their active ingredients, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. However, ophthalmic formulations of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones differ in terms of the inclusion of preservatives. While gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.3% (Zymar; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) contains 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (BAK), moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox; Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) is preservative-free. Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of BAK dramatically affects the antibacterial activity of the ophthalmic formulation of gatifloxacin. This study was designed to compare the kill rates of ophthalmic solutions of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones against isolates of common ocular bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Approximately 5.6 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of Haemophilus influenzae (n=1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), Staphylococcus aureus (n=2), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n=4), methicillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (n=4), and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. epidermidis (n=1) were incubated with ophthalmic solutions of either gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin. Viable bacteria were quantified at specific time points up to 60 minutes. RESULTS: Gatifloxacin 0.3% completely eradicated H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae in 5 minutes, one of two S. aureus isolates in 15 minutes, and the other S. aureus isolate in 60 minutes. Gatifloxacin 0.3% completely killed all MRSA, MRSE, and fluoroquinolone-resistant S. epidermidis isolates in 15 minutes. Moxifloxacin 0.5% completely eradicated Strep. pneumoniae and one of four MRSA isolates in 60 minutes. All other isolates incubated with moxifloxacin 0.5% retained viable bacteria ranging from 1.8 to 4.4 log(10) CFU/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The ophthalmic solution of gatifloxacin 0.3% eradicated bacteria that frequently cause postoperative ocular infections substantially faster than did the ophthalmic solution of moxifloxacin 0.5%.
TI  - Improved photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive bacteria using hematoporphyrin encapsulated in liposomes and micelles.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising treatment modality for local infections. To increase the efficacy of photosensitizer, hematoporphyrin (Hp) was used as a model drug and encapsulated in liposomes and micelles. The bactericidal efficacy of the carrier-entrapped Hp was assessed against gram-positive bacteria. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hp was encapsulated in liposomes by a modified reversed-phase evaporation and extrusion method. Micelle-Hp was prepared by the reversed-phase evaporation method. Spectroscopic analysis was used to characterize the properties of Hp in PBS, liposome or micelle. The PDI efficacy was examined by using gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: The absorption and fluorescence emission spectra indicated that Hp encapsulated in liposomes and micelles is less likely to exist in aggregated form compared to that generally seen in an aqueous medium. Liposome- or micelle-Hp can induce complete eradication of the bacteria above a critical Hp dose, which is significantly lower than the dose required when using the non-encapsulated Hp. Furthermore, the PDI effect of the Hp encapsulated in micelles was superior to the Hp encapsulated in liposomes at lower Hp doses. Similar PDI results were also found in S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that photosensitizer entrapped in micelle exert similar or better PDI efficacy than that of liposome, which indicates this formulation may be useful for the treatment of local infections in the future.
TI  - Neonatal blood cultures: effect of delayed entry into the blood culture machine and bacterial concentration on the time to positive growth in a simulated model.
AB  - AIMS: To determine if: time from blood culture inoculation to positive growth (total time to positive) and time from blood culture machine entry to positive growth (machine time to positive) is altered by delayed entry into the automated blood culture machine, and if the total time to positive differs by the concentration of organisms inoculated into blood culture bottles. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci were chosen as clinically significant representative organisms. Two concentrations (> or =10 colony-forming units per millilitre and <1 colony-forming units per millilitre) were inoculated into PEDS BacT/Alert blood culture bottles and randomly allocated to one of three delayed automated blood culture machine entry times (30 min/8.5 h/15.5 h). RESULTS: For all organisms at all concentrations, except the Staphylococcus epidermidis, the machine time to positive was significantly decreased by delayed entry. For all organisms at all concentrations, the mean total time to positive significantly increased with increasing delayed entry into the blood culture machine. Higher concentrations of group B beta-haemolytic streptococci and Escherichia coli grew significantly faster than lower concentrations. CONCLUSION: Bacterial growth in inoculated bottles, stored at room temperature, continues although at a slower rate than in those blood culture bottles immediately entered into the machine. If a blood culture specimen has been stored at room temperature for greater than 15.5 h, the currently allowed safety margin of 36 h (before declaring a result negative) may be insufficient.
TI  - Acute-onset nosocomial endophthalmitis after cataract surgery: incidence, clinical features, causative organisms, and visual outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: To estimate the incidence of acute-onset endophthalmitis after cataract  surgery and to report its clinical features, microbiology, and final visual outcomes. SETTING: King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational case series. RESULTS: The 10-year incidence of acute-onset endophthalmitis after cataract surgery was 0.068%: 0.049% for extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and 0.085% for clear corneal phacoemulsification (P = .268). The incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.053% during the first 5 years of the study and 0.08% during the next 5 years. The most common presenting features were pain and poor red reflex. Of the 20 cases, 18 were culture positive. The culture isolates showed Staphylococcus species in 7 eyes (35%), Streptococcus species in 7 eyes (35%), polymicrobial or mixed infections in 3 eyes (15%), and Propionibacterium acnes in 1 eye (5%). Two patients (10%) achieved a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better, 5 (25%) had worse than 20/40 to better than 20/200, and 8 (40%) had worse than 20/200; 5 eyes (25%) were eviscerated. Visual outcomes were good in endophthalmitis cases after phacoemulsification and in cases caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and worse in cases that had Streptococcus species endophthalmitis. CONCLUSIONS: Clear corneal phacoemulsification had a 1.73-fold higher risk for acute endophthalmitis than ECCE. Although the incidence of endophthalmitis after ECCE was lower than after phacoemulsification, the outcome was much worse in post-ECCE endophthalmitis cases. Poor visual outcomes were associated with more virulent organisms and delayed presentation.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Microbiology of the external ear canal in six African elephants (Loxodonta africana).
AB  - Samples collected from both external ear canals of six adult female African elephants (Loxodonta africana) were cultured for fungi, yeasts and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. All the samples produced heavy growths of several aerobic bacteria, but anaerobic bacteria were rare and no fungi or yeasts were isolated. The most common bacterium isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was cultured from 11 of the 12 ears. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus lwoffi, alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species, and Aeromonas caviae were all isolated from at least six of the 12 ears.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - [Etiologic factors in urinary tract infection investigated in ambulatory setting. Community-acquired urinary tract infection: etiologic aspects and antibiotic resistance].
AB  - Urine bacteriological examination is one of the most frequently asked for examinations, in ambulatory as well as in hospitals, regarding specialty prophyle. The present study comprises a group of 3971 pacients that were sent to the laboratory for uroculture and showed a percentage of only 21.85% significant urocultures--the etiological groups most frequently isolated being Gram-negative bacilli--96.05%, respectively Escherichia sp. 76.95%, Klebsiella sp. 14.68%, Proteus sp. 4.66%. Out of the Gram-positive bacteria we encountered only group B streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Colimycine, phosphomycine, fluorurated quinolones were the most active on the Gram-negative flora, and the Gram-positive cocci were most frequently sensitive to amikacine, amoxycyline and ceftazidim.
TI  - Constituents and antimicrobial properties of blue honeysuckle: a novel source for phenolic antioxidants.
AB  - The fruit of Lonicera caerulea L. (blue honeysuckle; Caprifoliaceae) and its phenolic fraction were analyzed for nutrients and micronutrients. The phenolic fraction was prepared from berries percolated with 0.1% H3PO4 and SPE using Sepabeads SP207. The sugar and lipid content was analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. The total content of anthocyanins was determined using the pH differential absorbance method and aliphatic acids by capillary electrophoresis. MicroLC-MS/MS was used for determination of cyanidin-3-glucoside (the predominant anthocyanin), 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, paeonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, quercetin, its 3-glucoside, and 3-rutinoside, epicatechin, protocatechuic, gentisic, ellagic, ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and coumaric acids. The phenolic fraction displayed Folin-Ciocalteu reagent reducing (335 +/- 15 microg of gallic acid equivalent/mg) and DPPH and superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 12.1 +/- 0.1 and 115.5 +/- 6.4 microg/mL) and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation (IC50 160 +/- 20 microg/mL). The freeze-dried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of Candida parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of preservative-free topical anesthetic drops in current use in ophthalmology departments.
AB  - AIM: The antibacterial effect of topical anesthetics may lead to false-negative cultures from corneal specimens of bacterial keratitis. This in vitro study compared the antibacterial effect of 3 unpreserved topical anesthetics to indicate the most appropriate agent for corneal scrapes. METHODS: Four bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) derived from the most frequently isolated microorganisms from corneal ulcers were cultured from stored control stocks and clinical specimens. These strains were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3 preservative-free anesthetic eyedrops: proxymetacaine 0.5%, oxybuprocaine 0.4%, and tetracaine 1%. RESULTS: There was no inhibition of growth seen with proxymetacaine 0.5% (5000 microg/mL) with any of the organisms except S. epidermidis, which demonstrated an MIC of 2500 microg/mL (equivalent to a dilution of (1/2)). Tetracaine 1% (10,000 microg/mL) produced an MIC ranging between 625 and 1250 microg/mL, inhibiting all 4 strains at the commercially available dilution. Oxybuprocaine 0.4% (4000 microg/mL) resulted to be the second most inhibitory preparation with an MIC ranging between 1000 and 2000 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used preservative-free topical anesthetics differ in bacterial growth inhibition. This in vitro study showed that proxymetacaine 0.5% is the least inhibitory on bacterial growth and therefore the most appropriate to be used before corneal scrapes.
TI  - Novel biaryl oxazolidinones: in vitro and in vivo activities with pharmacokinetics in an animal model.
AB  - RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276, the new investigational oxazolidinones, have an extended spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive pathogens and showed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) lower than comparator drugs. MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) values of RBx 1000075, RBx 1000276 and linezolid against the isolates tested were, respectively: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25, 1 and 4 microg/mL; methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 0.5, 2 and 4 microg/mL; methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.25, 1 and 2 microg/mL; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 0.5, 1 and 2 microg/mL; and enterococci, 0.25, 1 and 4 microg/mL. Against respiratory pathogens, MIC(90) values were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.125, 0.5 and 2 microg/mL; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1, 0.5 and 2 microg/mL; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.5, 2 and 4 microg/mL. In vivo efficacies of RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 were evaluated in murine systemic infection against S. aureus (MRSA 562) and in a pulmonary infection model against S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303. In murine systemic infection, RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 showed efficacy against MRSA 562, exhibiting a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) of 6.25 and 9.92 mg/kg body weight for once-daily administration and 4.96 and 5.56 mg/kg body weight for twice-daily administration, respectively, whereas for linezolid the corresponding ED(50) values were 9.9 and 5.56 mg/kg body weight. In pulmonary infection with S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303, 50% survival was observed with RBx 1000075 at 50mg/kg once daily, whereas 60% survival was observed with RBx 1000276 at 50mg/kg thrice daily. The absolute oral bioavailabilities of RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 were 48% and 73%, with half-lives of 13.5 and 3.2h, respectively. RBx 1000075 and RBx 1000276 are promising investigational oxazolidinones against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - United States resistance surveillance results for linezolid (LEADER Program for 2007).
AB  - The LEADER Program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers, initiated in 2004. For the current reported year, the number of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS, 1020), enterococci (705), Streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in S. aureus strains. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (S. aureus and enterococci). Only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. The nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or Enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (G2576T, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2 strains). In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). Although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from Arizona and Ohio. The LEADER Program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. However,few studies available on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. This study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. A retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between September 2002 and February 2005 at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. In 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Klebsiella species (17%), Escherichia coli (10.6%), Proteus species (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), Streptococcus species (1.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and Candida albicans (0.8%). High rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. This high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. Continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.
TI  - Enumeration of Mycobacterium leprae using real-time PCR.
AB  - Mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited sensitivity and specificity. We have developed a real-time PCR assay for quantifying M. leprae DNA in biological samples. Primers were identified to amplify a shared region of the multicopy repeat sequence (RLEP) specific to M. leprae and tested for sensitivity and specificity in the TaqMan format. The assay was specific for M. leprae and able to detect 10 fg of purified M. leprae DNA, or approximately 300 bacteria in infected tissues. We used the RLEP TaqMan PCR to assess the short and long-term growth results of M. leprae in foot pad tissues obtained from conventional mice, a gene knock-out mouse strain, athymic nude mice, as well as from reticuloendothelial tissues of M. leprae-infected nine-banded armadillos. We found excellent correlative results between estimates from RLEP TaqMan PCR and direct microscopic counting (combined r = 0.98). The RLEP TaqMan PCR permitted rapid analysis of batch samples with high reproducibility and is especially valuable for detection of low numbers of bacilli. Molecular enumeration is a rapid, objective and highly reproducible means to estimate the numbers of M. leprae in tissues, and application of the technique can facilitate work with this agent in many laboratories.
TI  - Microbial contamination associated with mascara use.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial organisms are normally present on human eyelashes. Application of mascara to lashes has the potential to inoculate the mascara tube with microbes. This pilot study of a real-world situation investigated the microbial contamination of 2 brands of mascara used daily for 3 months. METHODS: Forty women between the ages of 18 and 39 were randomly assigned to use 1 of 2 brands of nonwaterproof mascara. All mascara tubes were unexpired and purchased on the same day. Subjects were instructed to use the mascara on both the upper and lower lids every day for 3 months. After 3 months, the mascara tubes were collected, cultured, and examined for microbial growth. RESULTS: Mascara tubes were collected from 33 of 40 (82.5%) subjects who began the study. Microbial growth was found in 36.4% of the subject tubes. Based on growth on selective media, most of the organisms were determined to be Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus species, or fungi. We did not attempt to quantify the numbers of bacteria or fungi present within the tubes. CONCLUSIONS: Because microbial presence was found in 36.4% of the mascara tubes cultured after 3 months of use, we recommend a maximum 3-month use of a mascara tube used on a daily basis. More frequent replacement may be warranted with further study.
TI  - Assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  - In contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. The objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. Samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. Several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. Staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. One representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Among the 48 S. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icaD gene and the mecA gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. In parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cylA, vanA, vanB, vanD, vanE and vanG genes. All of them were sensitive to vancomycin. There were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - Incidence of endophthalmitis related to intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and ranibizumab.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the overall incidence of endophthalmitis associated with office based intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and ranibizumab. METHODS: This is a retrospective, consecutive, multicenter case series involving four large clinical sites. Included were all patients receiving at least one injection of intravitreal bevacizumab or intravitreal ranibizumab. Follow-up after each injection was at least 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 12,585 injections of intravitreal bevacizumab and 14,320 injections of intravitreal ranibizumab were given during the study period. Infectious endophthalmitis developed in three patients after administration of bevacizumab and in three patients after administration of ranibizumab. Four of these patients were culture positive. Rates of endophthalmitis were 0.02% and 0.02%, respectively, with an overall rate of 0.02%. CONCLUSION: The rate of endophthalmitis associated with intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab is low, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 4,500 injections.
TI  - Endophthalmitis: gram positive ethiological agents and susceptibility to glycopeptides.
AB  - Endophthalmitis is a serious sight-threatening condition, with a postoperative incidence of 0.13 -0.7%. This study aimed to investigate the spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin. At this purpose, minimum inhibitory concentrations of teicoplanin and vancomycin of Gram-positive bacteria isolated in the period 2001--2007 from vitreous cultures were determined. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common organisms identified (31,8 %), followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus spp. e Bacillus spp. All bacteria were susceptible to teicoplanin and vancomycin. The two drugs showed a comparable activity against staphylococci and bacilli, while teicoplanin was more potent against streptococci and anaerobes. In conclusion, teicoplanin showed a spectrum of activity similar or even better that of vancomycin against the most common ethiological agents of postoperative endophthalmitis.
TI  - Influence of an intramammary infusion at drying-off of combined penethamate hydriodide, benethamine penicillin, and framycetin sulfate on intramammary infections and somatic cell counts in dairy sheep.
AB  - The dynamics of intramammary infection (IMI) during the dry period were studied in 435 half-udders of 229 Assaf ewes, belonging to 2 flocks with high and medium IMI prevalences. Ewes were randomly assigned to 2 lots: 1) treated lot (TL) with 223 half-udders (118 ewes), which received complete dry therapy (1 syringe/teat) of an antibiotic combination containing 100 mg of penethamate hydriodide, 280 mg of benethamine penicillin, and 100 mg of framycetin sulfate, and 2) control lot (CL) with 212 nontreated half-udders (111 ewes). Two samplings per half-udder were carried out on 2 different days in the 5 d preceding drying-off, and 2 other samplings were again carried out in the 5 first d of the postpartum period. The length of the dry period averaged 109.0 d. Cure, persistent infections, reinfection, and new infection rates were 81.7, 12.8, 5.5, and 7.9%, respectively, for TL and 13.3, 70.4, 16.3, and 22.8%, respectively, for the CL. The prevalence of IMI decreased significantly from 48.9% at drying-off to 13.0% at lambing for the TL, but it did not vary for the CL (46.2 and 52.4%, respectively). Within the TL, IMI prevalence significantly diminished for Staphylococcus (41.3 to 9.9%) and Streptococcus (5.8 to 1.8%) genera, and more specifically this decrease was most evident for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae species. Log somatic cell count (SCC) diminished significantly between drying-off (5.68) and lambing (5.33) in the TL, whereas log SCC did not vary in the CL (5.61 vs. 5.66). This SCC reduction was very significant in the flock with the greater IMI prevalence. As a conclusion, the antibiotic formulation used as dry therapy drastically diminished IMI prevalence and SCC during the dry period in dairy ewes as a result of greater IMI cure rates and lower reinfection and new infection rates in the TL compared with the CL.
TI  - Bacterial DNA sample preparation from whole blood using surface-modified Si pillar arrays.
AB  - A novel bacterial DNA sample preparation device for molecular diagnostics has been developed. On the basis of optimized conditions for bacterial adhesion, surface-modified silicon pillar arrays for bacterial cell capture were fabricated, and their ability to capture bacterial cells was demonstrated. The capture efficiency for bacterial cells such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus mutans in buffer solution was over 75% with a flow rate of 400 microL/min. Moreover, the proposed method captured E. coli cells present in 50% whole blood effectively. The captured cells from whole blood were then in- situ lyzed on the surface of the microchip, and the eluted DNA was successfully amplified by qPCR. These results demonstrate that the full process of pathogen capture to DNA isolation from whole blood could be automated in a single microchip.
TI  - Effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. Prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (EC) enhances the activities of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus gordonii. This phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. The purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and S. epidermidis. An eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or EC to biofilm-coated coupons were used. No significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) CFU/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for S. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes EC were used against MRSA biofilms (P = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes EC against S. epidermidis biofilms (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). The results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by EC is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of synovial fluid in the knee.
AB  - This study evaluated antimicrobial properties of synovial fluid against 3 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Synovial fluid was collected from the knees of 52 patients. Three gram-positive bacteria culture lines were incubated in wells containing either synovial fluid and broth, or broth alone. Fluid was plated and incubated, and colonies were counted after 1, 4, and 24 hours to determine bacterial growth. Statistically significant differences in bacterial counts were found between control and experimental groups at 0, 4, and 24 hours for all 3 bacterial species. Bacterial counts in the control specimens demonstrated exponential growth over 24 hours as would be expected in the absence of growth inhibition. In contrast, bacterial counts in all of the synovial fluid specimens decreased steadily over 24 hours. These results demonstrate synovial fluid possesses potent bactericidal activity against the most common gram-positive pathogens responsible for septic arthritis. Delineating these antimicrobial properties further may offer avenues to augment the body's protection against bacterial infections.
TI  - Bacteriocin ST91KM, produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM, is a narrow-spectrum peptide active against bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ST91KM produces a bacteriocin (macedocin ST91KM) active against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Macedocin ST91KM is, according to tricine-SDS PAGE, between 2.0 and 2.5 kDa in size. Antimicrobial activity remained unchanged after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-10.0 and after 100 min at 100 degrees C. The peptide was inactivated after 20 min at 121 degrees C and when treated with proteolytic enzymes. Treatment with alpha-amylase had no effect on activity, suggesting that the mode of action does not depend on glycosylation. Amplification of the genome of strain ST91KM with primers designed from the macedocin precursor gene (mcdA) produced 2 fragments (approximately 375 and 220 bp) instead of one 150-bp fragment, as recorded for macedocin produced by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Strain ACA-DC 198 was not available. However, DNA amplified from strain LMG 18488 (ACA-DC 206), genetically closely related to strain ACA-DC 198, revealed 99% homology to the mcdA of strain ACA-DC 198 (accession No. DQ835394). Macedocin ST91KM may thus be a second putative bacteriocin described for Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - [The assessment of bacterial flora and antibiotic-sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea].
AB  - AIM: To evaluate bacterial flora of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea and of healthy people. Bacterial colonization of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions is more frequent in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea. Because antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are quite often met, it seems important to determine antibiotic-sensitivity of isolated bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 178 people underwent bacteriological examination of conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and skin lesions: 64 patients with acne vulgaris, 59 patients with rosacea and 55 healthy persons. Microorganisms were identified with laboratory techniques with the use of bio-Merieux kits and determination of drug-sensitivity was performed with recognized laboratory techniques. RESULTS: Positive cultures and general frequencies of the isolations were found to be higher in both groups in comparison with the reference group (the group of clinically healthy people). In healthy persons practically the only saprophytic bacteria--the most often S. epidermidis and S. viridans--were isolated. Whereas in patients suffering from acne vulgaris and rosacea the pathogenic bacteria--S. aureus, P. fluorescens, P. acnes, P. aeruginosa--were additionally isolated. Different spectrum of sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions in the cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea was proved. CONCLUSIONS: 1. In the cases of acne vulgaris the majority of isolated bacteria from conjunctival sac included Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae. 2. In the severe cases of rosacea the main bacteria found in conjunctival sac were S. aureus, S.pyogenes, P.aeruginosa, E. faecalis, A. baumanii, P. fluorescens. 3. Because of changeable drug-sensitivity of bacterial strains, it seems to be necessary to perform individual culture and antibiogram in every patient with inflammatory lesions, in particular in clinically severe and resistant to therapy cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea. 4. The higher frequency of the bacterial colonisations in the conjunctival sac in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea can be a potential source of ocular infections in the cases of local and systemic disorders of protective mechanisms. 5. Estimation of bacterial flora and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions should be perform, especially when patients are prepared for eye surgery.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - Bovine mastitis and antibiotic resistance patterns in Selalle smallholder dairy farms, central Ethiopia.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of mastitis, identify the major bacterial pathogens and test the antimicrobial resistance of milk bacterial isolates in smallholder dairy farms in Selalle area, Ethiopia. A total of 109 smallholder dairy farms comprising 500 crossbred lactating cows were included. The prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd, cow and quarter level was 8.3% (n=9), 1.8% (n=9) and 0.51% (n=10), respectively, while that of sub-clinical mastitis was 54.7%, 22.3% and 10.1%, respectively. The univariate logistic regression showed that among the risk factors considered, presence of teat lesion, stage of lactation and parity number had significant effect on the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis. However, after multivariate analysis, only presence of teat lesion and stage of lactation had significant effect. The common isolates from the clinical mastitic quarters were St. agalactiae (30%, n=3) and St. dysgalactiae (30%, n=3), while from sub-clinical cases were S. aureus (42.6%, n=83), S. epidermidis (22.1%, n=43), St. agalactiae (12.8%, n=25) and St. uberis (10.3%, n=20). Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were the species, which showed high level of susceptibility for most of the antimicrobials tested, while the remaining had varying levels of resistance for almost all the antimicrobials used. Among the antimicrobials employed, erythromycin and sulphonamide showed the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. Considering the possible significant economic losses that could be incurred by both clinical and sub-clinical mastitis, attention should be paid for further detailed investigations including the economic losses and benefits of interventions in the study area.
TI  - In vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. In this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Entecoccus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. Ciprofloxacine discs (CIP, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: No inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. Ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of E. coli. The inhibition rates of Ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of CIP. Whereas MIC and MBC values of ketamine for S. aureus and S. pyogenes were 500 microg mL(-1), MIC and MBC values for P. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg mL(-1). For other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. We thought that it will be proper to use ketamine hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of CBR-2092, a novel rifamycin-quinolone hybrid antibiotic: microbiology profiling studies with staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - We present data from antimicrobial assays performed in vitro that pertain to the  potential clinical utility of a novel rifamycin-quinolone hybrid antibiotic, CBR-2092, for the treatment of infections mediated by gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s for CBR-2092 against 300 clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci ranged from 0.008 to 0.5 mug/ml. Against Staphylococcus aureus, CBR-2092 exhibited prolonged postantibiotic effects (PAEs) and sub-MIC effects (SMEs), with values of 3.2, 6.5, and >8.5 h determined for the PAE (3x MIC), SME (0.12x MIC), and PAE-SME (3x MIC/0.12x MIC) periods, respectively. Studies of genetically defined mutants of S. aureus indicate that CBR-2092 is not a substrate for the NorA or MepA efflux pumps. In minimal bactericidal concentration and time-kill studies, CBR-2092 exhibited bactericidal activity against staphylococci that was retained against rifampin- or intermediate quinolone-resistant strains, with apparent paradoxical cidal characteristics against rifampin-resistant strains. In spontaneous resistance studies, CBR-2092 exhibited activity consistent with balanced contributions from its composite pharmacophores, with a mutant prevention concentration of 0.12 mug/ml and a resistance frequency of <10(-12) determined at 1 mug/ml in agar for S. aureus. Similarly, CBR-2092 suppressed the emergence of preexisting rifamycin resistance in time-kill studies undertaken at a high cell density. In studies of the intracellular killing of S. aureus, CBR-2092 exhibited prolonged bactericidal activity that was superior to the activities of moxifloxacin, rifampin, and a cocktail of moxifloxacin and rifampin. Overall, CBR-2092 exhibited promising activity in a range of antimicrobial assays performed in vitro that pertain to properties relevant to the effective treatment of serious infections mediated by gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of Streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 Streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. Detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types I, II, III and IV were carried out by PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. In addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. There was a high phenotypic diversity; some Streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other Streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (I-IV). There was no positive correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (Spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, P>0.05). In conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.
TI  - Infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - Hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. We therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. Between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. Of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. The mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). Among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included Propionibacterium acnes in three, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus species in one, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with Peptostreptococcus in one. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). Two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. The Neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. The data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. The surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of riboflavin/UVA combination (365 nm) in vitro for bacterial and fungal isolates: a potential new treatment for infectious keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the antimicrobial properties of riboflavin/UVA (365 nm) against common pathogens. METHODS: One group of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PA], Staphylococcus aureus [SA], and Staphylococcus epidermidis [SE]) was tested by using Kirby-Bauer discs with (1) empty disc (Control - C); (2) riboflavin 0.1% (B2); (3) riboflavin 0.1% previously activated by UVA (B2'); (4) UVA alone (UVA); (5) group 2+additional UVA exposure (UVA+B2); and (6) group 3+additional UVA exposure (UVA+B2'). In addition, another group of microbes was tested with the same approach: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP), and Candida albicans (CA). The mean growth inhibition zone (GIZ) in square millimeters was measured around the discs. The mean standard deviation (MSD) was calculated to be 3.65 when alpha = 0.01. A mean deviation (MD) > MSD indicates a significant difference. RESULTS: In the first group, the GIZ was significantly greater after UVA (MD = 14.30), UVA+B2 (MD = 39.61), and UVA+B2' (MD = 40.45) when compared with C, B2, and B2'. UVA alone was less effective than UVA+B2 (MD = 25.31) and UVA+B2' (MD = 26.15). The second group demonstrated increased GIZ in UVA (MD = 6.98), UVA+B2 (MD = 17.80), and UVA+B2' (MD = 21.15) when compared with C, B2, and B2'. UVA alone was less effective against the second group of bacteria than was UVA+B2 (MD = 10.82) and UVA+B2' (MD = 14.17). CA did not show any GIZ after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Riboflavin/UVA was effective against SA, SE, PA, MRSA, MDRPA, and DRSP, but was ineffective on CA and has the potential for use in treatment of microbial keratitis in the future.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - [The disinfecting effect of ozone on four kinds of bacteria].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the disinfecting effect of ozone on 4 kinds of bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. METHODS: The concentration of ozone that was transmitted by ozone generator at different time was determined by using iodine titrimetric method. According to the bactericidal assay of quantitative vehicle, the bacteria on the ozonized vehicles and unozonized vehicles was washed, 50 microl eluant was seeded on the TSA plates. The TSA plates were put into the anaerobiotic incubator (90% N(2),10% CO(2),37 degrees centigrade). After 24 to 48 hours, the CFU on the plate was counted.The data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with SAS 6.12 software package. RESULTS: The sterilization effect depended on the ozone concentration and the treatment time. When the 4 kinds of bacteria were treated with 2.73 mg/L ozone for 45 minutes, there was no bacteria alive. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone has obvious disinfecting effect on the 4 kinds of bacteria and the effect is correlated with the concentration of ozone.
TI  - Treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  - Isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. We examined the organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. Patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic treatment, and complications were reviewed. The organisms included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (five), Streptococcus B beta hemolytic (five), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), Streptococcus viridans (one), Escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (one), and Propionibacterium acnes (one). We treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). One patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. Another patient died during hospitalization. Open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. Functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - Emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. This resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). Although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of SCCmec elements by susceptible ancestors has taken place at different times and at different locations. Among Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. Also in Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. They became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.
TI  - Infection after the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: evaluation of the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on clinical outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with infection after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although previous studies have evaluated this postoperative complication, no studies to date have looked at the impact of this complication on both radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: From 1986 to 2004, 236 patients were identified who underwent surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and had at least 2-year follow-up. The medical records of patients who developed infection were retrospectively reviewed in detail. Preoperative and most recent postoperative radiographic parameters and Scoliosis Research Society 24 outcomes of both infected and noninfected patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 236 patients 7 (3%) developed an infection. One was acute (17 days postoperative), and 6 were delayed (average 34.2 months postoperative). The most common presenting complaints included back pain (5 of 7) and localized swelling (4 of 7). All patients with delayed infection were treated with 1 surgery (irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal) and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Of 6 patients 3 had pseudarthrosis. Culture results were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Group A Streptococcus (n = 1), no growth (n = 1). The patient with acute infection required 6 surgical procedures and 16 weeks of antibiotics. Cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marscesens. Revision fusion surgery was performed 5 months after the infection was treated. Compared with the noninfected patients, those with infection had lower percent thoracic (P = 0.01) and lumbar (P = 0.06) curve correction. There was no difference in the pain, function, self-image, satisfaction, or total Scoliosis Research Society 24 scores. CONCLUSION: Postoperative infection after the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis can successfully be treated with irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal, and a course of antibiotics. Although less curve correction was achieved in the infected group, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes when compared with the noninfected group.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - A new, simple approach to confer permanent antimicrobial properties to hydroxylated surfaces by surface functionalization.
AB  - A new, simple method to obtain ultrathin polycationic monolayers on hydroxylated  surfaces is described which uses a bifunctional copolymer comprising a reactive part (trimethoxysilane) and positive charges (quaternary ammonium salts) to confer antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Aggressive management of shunt infection: combined intravenous and intraventricular antibiotic therapy for twelve or less days.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This report is limited to patients with a single cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infected by a single organism, and compares two treatment protocols. METHODS: In the initial protocol (1975-1991), patients underwent removal of the shunt system and received intravenous and intraventricular antibiotics. Intraventricular antibiotics were administered twice daily to those with external ventricular drainage. When CSF was cultured 48 h off all antibiotics and found to be sterile at 24 h of incubation, a new shunt was inserted. Follow-up CSF cultures were obtained in all patients between 1-6 months following placement of the new shunt. RESULTS: There were 25 patients (ages 1 month to 16 years; mean +/- SD: 23 +/- 4.0 months). CSF obtained from the shunt yielded the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (19), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Streptococcus species (2), Serratia marcescens (1), and Propionebacterium species (1). The duration of intravenous antibiotics was 7-12 days (mean +/- SD: 9.7 +/- 1.3 days), and intraventricular antibiotic therapy was 6.2 +/- 1.7 days. Total hospital stay was 15.2 +/- 2.3 days. The follow-up period was 7.7 +/- 3.6 years. Following the initial protocol in another 15 patients (1992-2004), the treatment regime was modified in that intraventricular antibiotics were administered once daily in patients with external ventricular drainage, and the CSF was cultured at 24 h off antibiotics, instead of 48 h. Results were similar to the initial protocol with respect to days of antibiotic therapy and hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Based on our retrospective nonrandomized series, we believe patients with a single shunt and noncompartmentalized hydrocephalus can be successfully treated without a prolonged antibiotic course and lengthy hospital stay.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ertapenem against strains isolated from diabetic foot infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial strains isolated from diabetic foot infections (DFI). METHODOLOGY: All diabetic patients hospitalized for a first episode of DFI (stages 2 to 4, according to the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot Classification) were selected in the Nimes University hospital between January 2005 to December 2005. MICs were determined using both E-test strips and dilution methods on bacterial strains isolated from foot samples. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two bacteria (154 Gram-positive cocci including 94 Staphylococcus aureus, 80 Gram-negative bacilli with 56 Enterobacteriaceae, and 18 anaerobes) were studied. Ertapenem was active against all Streptococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, and also against 89.8% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. However, this antibiotic was active only against 31.5% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 21.8% of Enterococcus faecalis, and 15.8% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ertapenem may be a useful agent to treat patients suffering from DFI after bacterial identification.
TI  - Epidemiological and bacteriological survey of buffalo mastitis in Nepal.
AB  - A total of 355 Murrah cross buffaloes, consisting of 23 subclinical and 332 clinical mastitis cases brought to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Chitwan, Nepal from 2002 to 2005, were analyzed to determine the organisms involved, the seasonal occurrence of mastitis, and antibiotic susceptibility of mastitis pathogens. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) such as Staphylococcus albus and S. epidermidis were the predominant organisms associated with subclinical cases, and CNS and Coliforms in clinical cases. The maximum number (16%) of clinical cases of mastitis were observed in the month of July, when temperature and humidity are highest. The incidence of clinical mastitis was higher in animals during 1st calving and during the 1st month of parturition. Resistance to antibiotics was determined for 55, 23 and 149 isolates of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and Coliforms, respectively. In vitro drug sensitivity testing revealed that enrofloxacin had the highest average sensitivity (91%) for all types of bacteria. The effectiveness of other drugs detected were gentamicin (87%), tetracycline (83%) and chloramphenicol (82%). The antibiogram showed that both gentamicin and enrofloxacin are slowly becoming resistant. Mastitis pathogens have developed resistance to ampicillin and penicillin.
TI  - Stimulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. Eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. METHODS: Microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. Growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by P. gingivalis. It was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with P. gingivalis. Enhancement of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxS. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by F. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.
TI  - Reliability of serum procalcitonin concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis in  neonates.
AB  - The evaluation of tests for neonatal sepsis is important because the infection may present a very serious threat to the baby. Extensive literature exists on single laboratory test or combinations of tests, as well as tests used together with risk factors and/or clinical signs, to diagnose neonatal sepsis. In many instances, the results of the evaluations have been conflicting. It has recently been suggested that serum procalcitonin (PCT) is of value: in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, with varying results. This study was designed to determine the reliability of PCT concentrations as a new marker for the diagnosis of early neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing to the traditional inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values. The current study included 69 newborn babies. After full history and clinical examination, they were classified into 2 groups: Group 1, included 27 of asymptomatic newborn infants admitted during the first 24 h of life to the neonatal unit because of prematurity, low birth weight. They had no clinical signs of sepsis during their first week of life and had a negative blood culture, and they did not receive antibiotic treatment. The second group: Group 2, included 42 symptomatic neonates who were admitted to the neonatal care unit and were evaluated for sepsis during the first 48 h of life, they were subclassified into twosubgroups: group 2A; included 22 neonates of confirmed vertical neonatal sepsis, defined as they had at least three clinical signs of infection with culture proven sepsis, and group 2B included 20 neonates of vertical clinical sepsis (they had at least three clinical signs of infection) with negative blood culture. Blood sampling for blood culture, complete blood count, blood gases and blood chemistry, additionally, CRP, serum IL-6 and PCT were measured. The microbial organisms isolated from the blood culture of group 2A; Escherichia coli was isolated from 9 cases, staphylococcus aureus from 6 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis from 2 cases, group B streptococci (GBS) from 2 cases, ureaplasma from 2 cases and one case was GBS positive mother. The comparison between the studied groups revealed that, white blood cell counts (WBCs) and CRP levels were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. While in group 2B the WBCs not differed from group 1 but CRP differed from group 1. IL-6 and PCT values were significantly increased in group 2A more than in group 1 and group 2B. Furthermore in group 2B both were significantly increased as compared to group 1. For the diagnosis of neonatal infection, at cutoff >1.5 ng/ml, PCT give a sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 85.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 84.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76.7%. At a cutoff >140 ng/ml, IL-6 gives a sensitivity of 76.2%, speCificity of 70.4%, PPV of 64%, NPV of 63.3%. However, at a cutoff >12 mg/L, CRP gives a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 77.8%, PPV of 77.1%, NPV of 70%. We conclude that the serum PCT concentration showed a good diagnostic value for the early detection of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission comparing with the other traditional markers of inflammations, thus may facilitate early therapeutic intervention in those high risk group.
TI  - [Etiology and results of treatment of adults with bacterial encephalomeningitis].
AB  - Results of treatment and outcomes of 89 adults with purulent encephalomeningitis, treated in years 1996-2002 in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, Medical University of Lodz, were analyzed. Eighty nine patients were retrospectively included into the study. Results of treatment were evaluated at the last day of patient's hospitalization, and classified as: cure, disability or death. Results of treatment were analyzed in relation to etiology of purulent encephalomeningitis, age and gender of patients, course of the disease, and time from the onset of symptoms to admission to the Department. No statistically significant correlations between age, gender and prognosis were found. Thirty seven out of 89 patients were cured (41.6%); 29 of 89 patients died (32.6%); in 18 patients (19/89; 20.2) disability was diagnosed. In remaining 5 cases (5.6%), the result of treatment remained unknown. These patients were transferred to Intensive Care Units, outside our Hospital. In the studied group, etiologic factor was identified in 40 out of 89 cases (44.9%). In 40 patients, positive results of bacterial examination of cerebrospinal fluid were achieved. In 22 out of these 40 cases (55.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified as the etiologic factor. Higher percentage of patients died in subgroup with known etiology than in in subgroup of unknown etiology (p = 0.02). Higher percentage of cases with unconsciousness and higher percentage of cases with respiratory insufficiency were diagnosed in patients who died, than in patients who were cured (p = 0.00001). CONCLUSION: 1. Purulent meningoencephalitis in adults, despite progress in antibiotic treatment, is still a serious condition, with poor prognosis. 2. Diagnostics and treatment modalities of purulent meningo-encephalitis should be urgently extended in order to achieve better outcomes in these group of patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis sample were used. The storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPRT). Refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPR). To perform the immediate effect analysis (GPi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although GPR, iodoform, Rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees C average temperature. The testing methodology was Dilution in Solid Medium-Agar. The Wilcoxon Test and Friedman variance analyses were used. RESULTS: The GP paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. CONCLUSION: The pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.
TI  - A critical review of oxazolidinones: an alternative or replacement for glycopeptides and streptogramins?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the available data on the oxazolidinones linezolid and eperezolid. DATA SELECTION: Published reports were obtained by searching MEDLINE for articles published between 1992 and 2000, inclusive. References of published papers were also obtained and reviewed. Abstracts from scientific proceedings were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Due to the limited data available regarding these agents, the criteria for study inclusion were not restrictive. DATA SYNTHESIS: The oxazolidinones (eg, linezolid) are a new antimicrobial class with a unique mechanism of action. They are active against resistant Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococccus epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). Linezolid is active against anaerobes and displays modest activity against fastidious Gram-negative pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, but is not active against Enterobacteriaceae. Linezolid is available both orally and parenterally, and has a bioavailability of 100%. Clinical trials comparing linezolid with standard therapy have demonstrated similar bacteriological and clinical cures rates to standard therapy in community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated and complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and infections caused by MRSA and VRE. Adverse effects have been minor and infrequent; however, platelets should be monitored in patients who have received more than two weeks of linezolid therapy. It is expected that these agents will have a bright future due to their excellent spectrum of activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive organisms, such as MRSA, VRE and PRSP, and their excellent bioavailability. CONCLUSION: The oxazolidinones represent a new class of antimicrobials with a unique mechanism of action. They have excellent activity against susceptible and resistant Gram-positive organisms such as MRSA, methicillin-susceptible S epidermidis, VRE and PRSP, and a good adverse effect profile; they can be administered both intravenously and orally. Their potential use in Canada may be as an intravenous and oral alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis in children: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. Its incidence owing to invasive Streptococcus pyogenes has significantly increased in children recently. Our experience with NF in children to describe diagnostic and therapeutic aspects is hence presented herein. METHODS: Records of children who were treated for NF in our unit from 1999 to 2006, inclusive, were reviewed retrospectively. Information recorded for each patient included medical history, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, and the outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with a mean age of 35 months were treated for NF during the study period. All of the 13 children had no previous immunosuppression. The predisposing factors were composed of varicella lesions, intramuscular injections, application of a cream containing menthol to the cervical region, penetrant gluteal trauma, omphalitis, dental abscess, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The most common site of the initial involvement was the abdominal wall, followed by the gluteal region and thigh, head and neck, and upper and lower extremities. The initial skin presentations were induration or cellulitis and erythema and edema with progression to skin discoloration and bullae formation. Fever and tachycardia were the most common clinical features. S. pyogenes was the most common causative microorganism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients underwent extensive surgical debridement and received appropriate antibiotics and supportive therapy. Twelve patients survived, and 1 patient with delayed diagnosis of NF died of septic shock. CONCLUSION: Although these infections are rare in children, their lethal potential and early diagnostic signs must be recognized. All children with NF should undergo early surgical debridement to prevent delay in treatment. The mortality and morbidity associated with NF in children can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, and adequate and urgent surgical debridement followed by intensive supportive care and early wound resurfacing.
TI  - Review. Leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in inflammation focusing on inflammatory heart disease.
AB  - In multicellular organisms the development of adhesion bonds, either among cells  or among cells and components of the extracellular matrix, is a crucial process. These interactions are mediated by molecules which are named adhesion molecules and play a main role both at the early stages of the development of tissue integrity and later. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have a key role in several pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. Selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily of adhesion receptors mediate different steps of leukocyte migration from the bloodstream towards the inflammatory foci. Leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium are highly orchestrated processes that include the capture of free-flowing leukocytes from the blood with subsequent leukocyte rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and ensuing diapedesis. These interactions occur under high shear stresses within venules and depend on multiple families of adhesion molecules. As a response to infection mediators, leukocyte gathering is considered to be crucial for the adequate defence of the organism to any kind of injury or infection. Endothelial activation contributes significantly to the systemic inflammatory response to bacteraemia and increased expression. Release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of CAMs and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. It has been proposed that infection of endothelial cells with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis induces surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and monocyte adhesion. In general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion can no longer be viewed as occurring in discrete steps mediated by individual families of adhesion molecules but rather as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. These cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses.
TI  - Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  - Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.
TI  - Characterization of the physicochemical, antimicrobial, and drug release properties of thermoresponsive hydrogel copolymers designed for medical device applications.
AB  - In this study, a series of hydrogels was synthesized by free radical polymerization, namely poly(2-(hydroxyethyl)methacrylate) (pHEMA), poly(4-(hydroxybutyl)methacrylate) (pHBMA), poly(6-(hydroxyhexyl)methacrylate) (pHHMA), and copolymers composed of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAA), methacrylic acid (MA), NIPAA, and the above monomers. The surface, mechanical, and swelling properties (at 20 and 37 degrees C, pH 6) of the polymers were determined using dynamic contact angle analysis, tensile analysis, and thermogravimetry, respectively. The T(g) and lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) were determined using modulated DSC and oscillatory rheometry, respectively. Drug loading of the hydrogels with chlorhexidine diacetate was performed by immersion in a drug solution at 20 degrees C (<LCST) and subsequent characterization of the drug release and antimicrobial properties performed at 20 and 37 degrees C. The composition of the hydrogels directly affected the advancing contact angle, mechanical properties, and swelling. Thermoresponsive behavior was only observed with hydrogels composed of HEMA, NIPAA, MA, and NIPAA in which pulsatile drug release was obtained by elevating the temperature from below to above the LCST. A greater mass and enhanced pulsatile release of drug, with the associated greater antimicrobial properties (an 10(8) reduction in viability of Staphylococcus epidermidis in 15 min), was associated with poly(NIPAA-co-HEMA, 1:1). It is suggested that the pulsatile drug release and favorable antimicrobial and mechanical properties of candidate hydrogels, particularly poly(HEMA-co-NIPAA), offer promise as thermoresponsive, antimicrobial biomaterials that may be used as wound dressings, medical implants, or coatings of medical devices. Furthermore, it is suggested that drug loading may be effectively performed in situ by lowering the temperature of the device/dressing.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity, and quantitative structure-activity relationships of new (Z)-2-(nitroimidazolylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranone derivatives.
AB  - A new series of (Z)-2-(1-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-2-ylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranones (11a-p) and (Z)-2-(1-methyl-4-nitroimidazole-5-ylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranones (12a-m) were synthesized and assayed for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Most of the 5-nitroimidazole analogues (11a-p) showed a remarkable inhibition of a wide spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, MRSA, and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas 4-nitroimidazole analogues (12a-m) were not effective against selected bacteria. The quantitative structure-activity relationship investigations were applied to find out the correlation between the experimentally evaluated activities with various parameters of the compounds studied. The QSAR models built in this work had reasonable predictive power and could be explained by the observed trends in activities.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Mode of antibacterial action of a signal peptide, Pep27 from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Pep27  and its mode of action. The results indicated Pep27 exhibited antibacterial activities against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, but it did not exhibit antifungal activity. To understand the mode of action of Pep27, the cellular distribution of the peptide was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited Pep27 penetrated the bacterial membrane by an energy-independent pathway without any damage to the membrane when examined using liposome and membrane probe. After penetration into the bacterial cells, Pep27 was not affected by macromolecular synthesis, but activated protein phosphatase activity in dose ranges of 10-15 microM and time range of 5-10 min in case of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. These results demonstrated the antibacterial activities of Pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity.
TI  - Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced from cord blood in-vitro are pathogen dependent and increased in comparison to adult controls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a role in increased morbidity and mortality from neonatal sepsis. Objective of this study was to compare secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the cord blood cells of healthy term neonates to the venous blood cells of healthy adults in vitro after stimulation with common neonatal pathogens. METHOD: Blood samples were cultured in the presence of heat-killed group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi). Concentrations of secreted cytokines (interleukine-6, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha, interleukine-1 beta, IL-1beta and interleukine-8, IL-8) were measured after 0, 1, 2 and 4 h of incubation using chemiluminescent immunometric automated assay. RESULTS: Blood samples from 22 neonates and 16 adults were compared. After stimulation by GBS and E. coli, cord blood cells secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 than blood cells of healthy adults. In cord blood, E. coli induced secretion of higher concentration of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-8 than S. epi, and more IL-6 than GBS; GBS induced more IL-1beta than S.epi. CONCLUSIONS: Response of cord blood to microbial activators is different from that of adult controls. Each isolate of heat-killed bacteria induced different amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. This may represent a useful in vitro virulence test.
TI  - Penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  - The authors topically administered gatifloxacin (GFLX) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. Seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 0.3% GFLX ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for GFLX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean intraoperative GFLX concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/mL. GFLX level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/mL in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/mL) in the patients less than 70 years old. This concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (MIC90), such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) in vitro. The GFLX concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA in vitro.
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Rapid detection of causative pathogen of peritonitis using in-situ hybridization  in a patient with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis is a common problem  in patients on peritoneal dialysis, and the bacteriological diagnosis is important for the treatment of this condition. We used Hybrizep (a method for detecting the genes of bacteria ingested in phagocytes), to detect the causative bacterium in a 50-year-old woman receiving peritoneal dialysis who was admitted our hospital with bacterial peritonitis. The test, using peritoneal dialysis fluid, was positive for Streptococcus epidermidis. Vancomycin administration led to a good outcome for this patient. The Hybrizep method (which is available on the Japanese National Health system only for the diagnosis of septicemia) was a useful diagnostic approach for a patient on peritoneal dialysis who had peritonitis.
TI  - LEADER surveillance program results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from the United States (50 medical centers).
AB  - Surveillance for emerging linezolid resistance among commonly occurring Gram-positive pathogens in the United States began with the 2002 ZAAPS program and more recently (2004) expanded as the LEADER program. The 2006 LEADER program processed 5374 strains from 50 medical centers (100 per site) located within the 9 US census regions; species and number tested by broth microdilution (% linezolid susceptible) included Staphylococcus aureus (2913, >99.9), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNSs) (808, 98.4), enterococci (547, 97.4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (546, 100.0), viridans group streptococci (189, 100.0), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (371, 100.0). In addition to 1 linezolid-nonsusceptible S. aureus, 3 strains were daptomycin-nonsusceptible, 4 were quinupristin/dalfopristin-intermediate, 2 were vancomycin-intermediate (vancomycin MIC values, 4 mug/mL), and all were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among the linezolid-resistant isolates (1 S. aureus, 13 CoNSs, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates), all but 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates had the G2567T mutation. Overall, 99.55% of the tested 2006 LEADER program isolates remained susceptible to linezolid at current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints.
TI  - Activity of staphylococcal bacteriocins against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  - The inhibitory activity of seven bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus (aureocins A70, A53, and 215FN) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Pep5, epidermin, epilancin K7 and epicidin 280) was tested against strains of both S. aureus (165 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (74 strains) isolated from udders of cows suffering from bovine mastitis. Most strains of the two species were inhibited by epidermin (>85%), aureocin A53 (>67%) and by a combination of aureocins A70 and A53 (>91%), co-expressed in the genetic background of strain A70, the native producer of aureocin A70. Synergy between aureocins A70 and A53 was also demonstrated, which broadened the spectrum of strains inhibited. The remaining staphylococcins inhibited either none of, or a lower percentage (<48%) of, the mastitis-causing pathogens tested. Our results therefore show that the use of epidermin and/or a combination of aureocins A53 and A70 may represent a new non-antibiotic alternative for successfully inhibiting both mastitic staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Synthesis of derivatives of (9S) -9-hydroxyl-12-methylene erythromycin A and their antibacterial activity in vitro].
AB  - The derivatives of (9S)-9-hydroxyl-12-methylene erythromycin A were synthesized by using erythromycin A as a starting material. An intermediate (9S)-9,11-O-isopropylidene-6-O-allyl-2' ,4"-O-bis(benzoyl)-12,21-anhydro erythromycin A 12 was obtained. The antibacterial activity in vitro of two compounds, 6 and 11, was tested. The preliminary biological test showed that two compounds exhibited less potent antibacterial activity in vitro.
TI  - Comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. METHODS: MIC90s (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase III study and confirmed externally. RESULTS: The most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the phase III study were Haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), Propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). MIC90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. On the other hand, the MIC90 for H. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for S. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for S. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for S. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Implementation of a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations in Canada.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bacterial screening in apheresis platelet preparations was implemented in March of 2004 by Canadian Blood Services (CBS) using the BacT/ALERT system. The aim of this study was to develop, validate and implement an in-house proficiency testing programme to evaluate CBS performance of bacterial screening in platelet preparations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During development of the proficiency testing programme, apheresis platelet preparations were spiked with 10(1) and 10(2) colony forming units per ml of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The preparations were stored at 2-8 degrees C prior to culture bottle inoculation with 4 or 6 ml on Days 7-10 (estimated time from panel preparation to testing at CBS centres). Upon implementation, a combination of four proficiency panel members, including positives and negatives, were distributed to each of the centres that participated in the programme. A survey was conducted with 43 America's Blood Centers to assess whether they screen for bacterial testing in platelet preparations and whether they have implemented a proficiency testing programme. RESULTS: The development of the proficiency testing programme showed that S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa produced positive results at both concentrations and volumes on Days 7-10 poststorage. Streptococcus pneumoniae did not grow consistently and therefore was not selected for implementation of the programme. Two proficiency testing panel sets have been issued (July 2006 and February 2007) with 14 out of 15 (93%) and 14 out of 14 (100%) of the participant centres meeting the expected results for bacterial screening, respectively. The majority (72%) of the America's Blood Centers that screen for bacterial contamination have not implemented a proficiency testing programme and 94.4% of these centres are interested in developing such a programme. CONCLUSION: Canadian Blood Services has successfully implemented a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations, which will contribute to improving the safety of the platelet supply in Canada.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of substituted oxotriazolylphenyl oxazolidinones.
AB  - A series of 3-(4'-(2''-alkyl-3''-oxy-1'',2'',4''-triazolyl)-phenyl)-5-substituted oxazolidinones was designed and synthesized for in vitro antibacterial activity testing against fourteen Gram-negative and six Gram-positive standard organisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by agar dilution at concentrations of 0.10, 0.20, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25 microg/mL. Different alkyl groups at the 2''-position played an important role in the activity against Gram-positive organisms. (S)-3-(4'-(2''-ethyl-3''-oxy-1'',2'',4''-triazolyl)-phenyl)-5-acetamidomethyloxaz olidinone was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus enteridis and Streptococcus nonhemolyticus, whereas 2''-methyl, 2''-propyl and 2''-n-butyl counterparts did not show activity at 6.25 microg/mL. Modification of the 5-substitutent of oxazolidinones also affected the activity against Gram-positive organisms. (S)-3-(4'-(2''-ethyl-3''-oxy-1'',2'',4''-triazolyl)-phenyl)-5-acetamidomethyloxaz olidinones was approximately two fold more potent than 5-chloroacetamido, 5-dichloroacetamido and 5-trifluoroacetamido counterparts against Streptococcus enteridis. None of these compounds showed growth inhibition against fourteen Gram-negative organisms at 6.25 microg/mL.
TI  - Reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive RGD modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  - Ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. Poly(L-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. PLL-g-PEG can be functionalized with bioligands such as RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. Previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized PLL-g-PEG and RGD-peptide functionalized PLL-g-PEG reduced the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to titanium (Ti) surfaces. The present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. The different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence light microscopy (FM). The adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on Ti surfaces coated with PLL-g-PEG compared to uncoated Ti surfaces even in the presence of RGD. The percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. Therefore, coating surfaces with PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RGD allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.
TI  - Bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents.
AB  - As part of a United States-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001  to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (DFIs), we obtained 454 pretreatment specimens from 433 patients. After debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the R. M. Alden Research Laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. Cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. The predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (15.3%), Streptococcus species (15.5%), Enterococcus species (13.5%), Corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). The predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), Prevotella species (13.6%), Porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the Bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). Pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of P. aeruginosa cultures. Two or more species of Staphylococcus were present in 13.1% of the patients. Ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against >98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and anaerobes. Among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. Moderate-to-severe DFIs are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. Our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements.
AB  - Evidences supporting the introduction of metallic elements in several biological  processes are rapidly accumulating. Likewise, many drugs possess modified toxicological and pharmacological properties when in the form of metal complexes. In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various cephalosporins, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements has been studied and compared with the parent drug. The essential and trace elements comprised of magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, ferric, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium in the form of their chloride. These studies were carried out by observing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using agar dilution method and compared with the MIC'S of the standard cephalosporins against various species of Gram (+) and Gram (-) microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysenteriae. Different dilutions of cephalosporins and salts of essential and trace elements were used in these studies. The ratio of the drug and metal salts was 1:1 and the reactions were carried out at two different temperatures as 37 degrees C and 60 degrees C in order to study the complex formation. The aim of our study was on one hand to evaluate the changes in microbiological activity of the standard cephalosporins after in vitro metal interactions to study the synergetic or antagonistic behavior of the later through the difference in MICs values of these cephalosporins and on the other hand to access the bioassay directed extent of drug metal complexations. Our investigation reveal that interaction of above cephalosporins with essential and trace elements cause antagonistic effect in many cases which was shown by decrease in antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins and MIC values were increased.
TI  - [Toxic shock syndrome: experience in a pediatric intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in a pediatric intensive care unit. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with TSS admitted to the intensive care unit in the previous 15 years. The patients included were those that met the clinical and microbiological criteria for TSS proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: There were nine patients (four boys). The mean age was 7 years. The most frequent findings were fever (100 %), hypotension (100 %), erythroderma (100 %), multisystem organ failure [coagulopathy (100 %), lethargy (89 %), hypertransaminasemia (89 %), increased creatine phosphokinase levels (78 %), renal failure (66 %)] and cutaneous desquamation (100 %). Laboratory studies showed changes in the leukocyte count and C-reactive protein value in all patients. The etiology was as follows: Staphylococcus was detected in six patients (S. epidermidis in three and S. aureus in three) and Streptococcus was detected in two patients (S. pyogenes in one and S. pneumoniae in one); no microorganisms were detected in only one patient. The origin of the infection was identified in seven patients (cutaneous in six patients and tonsillar in one). All patients received life support and antibiotic treatment. Six patients received corticosteroid treatment and one received intravenous immunoglobulins. Patients with TSS secondary to Streptococcus showed the greatest severity, exhibiting renal failure and requiring greater respiratory and circulatory support. All patients recovered well from the infection, without serious long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION. TSS should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever, exanthema and shock, since early diagnosis has been shown to improve outcomes. S. pneumoniae should be included among the microorganisms that cause TSS. Treatment is based on life support measures and antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Identification of antibacterial constituents from the indigenous Australian medicinal plant Eremophila duttonii F. Muell. (Myoporaceae).
AB  - This paper reports on the isolation and identification of antibacterial constituents from the indigenous Australian medicinal plant Eremophila duttonii F. Muell. (Myoporaceae). Preparations derived from this plant are used by indigenous populations in the topical treatment of minor wounds, otitis and ocular complaints, and as a gargle for sore throat. Several authors have reported extracts of this plant to effect rapid bacteriolysis and inhibit growth of a wide range of Gram-positive micro-organisms. In other studies involving screening of native medicinal plants for antibacterial activity, extracts of Eremophila duttonii have been reported to consistently exhibit the highest potency amongst all species included. From a hexane extract, we identified two diterpenes of the serrulatane class, the principal constituents responsible for antibacterial activity and present as major constituents of the resinous leaf cuticle: serrulat-14-en-7,8,20-triol (1) and serrulat-14-en-3,7,8,20-tetraol (2). In addition, a hydroxylated furanosesquiterpene with mild antibacterial activity which appeared to be a novel compound was isolated from the extract and tentatively identified as 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl[2,3'-bifuran]-5-yl) pentan-2-one. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for each of the compounds against three Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ARL 10582), were determined using a micro-titre plate broth dilution assay.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - With the incidence of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. These compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. albus, Streptococcus enteridis and S. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (MIC: 3.13-6.25 mug/mL). The position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except S. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely S. albus, S. enteridis.
TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  - Intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. However, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (DPR), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (ADPR) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on MDR Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the DPR l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines NNC 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and NNC 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity relationship. These compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. Moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. This may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. The results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. Combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic DPR and ADPR of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.
TI  - Increased blood levels of IgG reactive with secreted Streptococcus pyogenes proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.
AB  - A pathogenic role for Streptococcus (S) pyogenes infections in chronic plaque psoriasis is suspected but poorly defined. We separated cellular and supernatant proteins from S. pyogenes cultures by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and used immunoblotting to demonstrate the diversity of serum or plasma IgGs that react with elements of the proteome of this bacterium. We have shown that a substantial proportion of IgG-reactive proteins from cultured S. pyogenes are secreted. The total secreted protein fraction, including diverse IgG-binding elements, was subsequently used in an ELISA to measure blood titers of reactive IgG. This ELISA showed that blood samples from patients with chronic plaque psoriasis contained significantly higher titers of reactive IgG than samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (P=0.0009). In contrast, neither a standard assay measuring antistreptolysin O titers nor ELISAs measuring titers of IgG reactive with protein fractions from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were able to distinguish between blood samples from the two groups. These findings justify the hypothesis that S. pyogenes infections are more important in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis than has previously been recognized, and indicate the need for further controlled therapeutic trials of antibacterial measures in this common skin disease.
TI  - Characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci from Colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci recovered from Colombian hospitals. METHODS: The resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1679), Staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (175), and Enterococcus spp (123). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. RESULTS: Resistance to ERY and CLI was 3.3% and 2.3% for S. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for S. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ERY resistance was 62% in Enterococcus faecalis and 82% in Enterococcus faecium. The MLS(B)-type accounted for 71% of S. pneumoniae and 100% of MRSA. The erm(A) gene was prevalent in MRSA, erm(B) in S. pneumoniae and enterococci, and erm(C) in CoNS isolates. Efflux pump genes (mef(A) genes) were mostly identified in S. pneumoniae (24%). The most common genotype amongst ERY-resistant pneumococci was the Spain(6B)-2 clone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance is low in Colombian pneumococci and high in MRSA (cMLS(B)-type).
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of nanocrystalline tetracalcium phosphate cements.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of cements prepared from mechanically activated tetracalcium phosphate (maTTCP) were tested with the agar diffusion test using Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and a clinically isolated plaque mixture. All maTTCP cements showed a significantly higher antimicrobial potency as revealed by inhibition zones of approximately 3-5 mm width, compared with a commercial Ca(OH)(2)//salicylate cement which only produced small inhibition zones around the cement specimens of 1.5 mm or less. This behavior was explained by the formation of amorphous Ca(OH)(2) during setting of maTTCP cements, which is thought to have a higher solubility and may release more OH(-) ions than conventional Ca(OH)(2)//salicylate cements. In fact, the pH value in the agar gel around the specimens was higher in the case of maTTCP cements (7.8-8.7) compared with the Ca(OH)(2)//salicylate control (7.0-8.0). The maTTCP cements did not affect the photoactivation of resin-based composites, and their antimicrobial activity is making them interesting candidates for the use as pulp-capping agents, endodontic sealers, or cavity liners in dentistry.
TI  - Microbiologic spectrum and visual outcome of posttraumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the microbiologic spectrum and visual outcome of infectious  endophthalmitis after open globe injuries. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients with culture-positive endophthalmitis after open globe injuries who were treated at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital and King Abdulaziz University Hospital (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2003. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were identified. There were 55 males and 12 females (mean age +/- SD, 23.3 +/- 18.3 years; range, 2-65 years). The mean follow-up +/- SD was 18.8 +/- 23.9 months (range, 1-120 months). Twenty-nine eyes (43%) had intraocular foreign bodies (IOFBs). A single species was isolated from 59 eyes, and multiple organisms were isolated from 8 eyes (total number of infecting organisms, 78). The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus species (26.9% of isolates each). Gram-negative organisms and fungi comprised 12.8% and 3.8% of isolates, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis comprised 37.1% of isolates in the group with IOFBs and 16.3% of isolates in the group without IOFBs (P = 0.0358). Streptococcus species comprised 41.8% of isolates in the group without IOFBs and 8.6% of isolates in the group with IOFBs (P = 0.0024). Final visual acuity was 20/200 or better in 30 eyes (47.6%). Visual acuity of 20/200 or better at presentation (P = 0.0474) and time from injury to presentation to our institutes of <1 day (P = 0.0348) were significantly associated with better visual acuity outcome. Final visual acuity of 20/200 or better was achieved in 61.9% of patients infected with nonvirulent organisms compared with 40.5% of patients infected with virulent organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The most common organisms identified were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus species. Clinical features associated with better visual acuity outcomes included better presenting visual acuity, early presentation to our institutes, and isolation of a nonvirulent organism. Posttraumatic endophthalmitis is associated with a poor visual prognosis.
TI  - Linezolid for the treatment of patients with central nervous system infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the available evidence regarding the use of linezolid for the treatment of patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections. DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies were identified through searches of the PubMed, Current Contents, and Cochrane databases (publications archived until October 2006). STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Case reports, case series, prospective and retrospective studies, and randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in our review if they evaluated the effectiveness and safety of linezolid for the treatment of patients with CNS infections. DATA SYNTHESIS: In 18 (42.9%) of the 42 relevant cases identified, patients had undergone neurosurgical operations and/or had prosthetic devices. Meningitis was the most common CNS infection, accounting for 20 (47.6%) cases. Other CNS infections included brain abscesses (14; 33.3%), ventriculitis (5; 11.9%), and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt infection (3; 7.1%). In the 39 patients in whom the responsible pathogen was isolated, those predominantly responsible for the CNS infections were: penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (7; 17.9%), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (6; 15.4%), Nocardia spp. (5; 12.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (4; 10.3%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3; 7.7%). Of the 42 patients who received linezolid for the treatment of CNS infections, 38 (90.5%) were either cured or showed clinical improvement of the infection. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.2 months; no recurrent CNS infection was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The limited published data suggest that linezolid may be considered for the treatment of patients with CNS infections in cases of failure of previously administered treatment or limited available options.
TI  - Review of data of the patients receiving total parenteral nutrition at the intensive care unit of a university hospital.
AB  - Parenteral nutrition is commonly administered to patients in intensive care units who cannot be fed gastrointestinally. Several problems might be encountered during parenteral nutrition. We designed this study to evaluate two years' data of the patients who received parenteral nutrition at the intensive care unit of the university hospital. Forty-five patients who were treated at this hospital between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 were included in this study. Patient data were collected via questionnaires designed based on the information in the literature. Blood, urinary, oropharyngeal and catheter entry site cultures were obtained and analyzed on the third and seventh days of the treatment. We found the following results: 31.1% of the patients received parenteral nutrition due to renal insufficiency; ready-made amino acid/lipid solutions were used in 86.7% of the patients; 77.8% of the solutions were administered through a peripheral vein; 88.6% of total parenteral nutrition solutions given thorough the peripheral vein had higher osmolarities than 800 mOsmol/L; routine Fe and Fe binding capacity, prothrombin time, cholesterol and triglyceride level assessments were not performed before the initiation of treatment; and the culture tests most commonly revealed Staphylococcus epidermidis in the blood, Candido species in urine, Streptococcus in throat, and Staphylococcus aureus at catheter entry sites. Based on these results, we suggest that organizing a nutrition support team would be useful in order to improve the quality of the nursery and to provide close and rational management and follow-up of the patients receiving total parenteral nutrition.
TI  - Amniotic membrane transplantation in severe bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (BK) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids. METHODS: In a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven BK were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by AMT at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. Pain relief (NRS-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured. RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with AMT performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with BK caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Moraxella cattharalis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). A significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7-10) to shortly after AMT (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1-3). Epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and 45 days (mean, 25.5 +/- 9.7 days). Neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early AMT combined with topical corticosteroid in severe BK provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.
TI  - Dry reagent dipstick test combined with 23S rRNA PCR for molecular diagnosis of bacterial infection in arthroplasty.
AB  - Periprosthetic joint infections present a challenging problem in orthopaedics. Conventional methods for detection of arthroplasty infections rely on bacterial culture of synovial fluid aspirates. During recent years, however, molecular tests that are based on DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by electrophoretic analysis of the products, have been introduced. We report a simple and inexpensive assay that allows visual detection and confirmation of the PCR-amplified sequences by hybridization within minutes. The assay is performed in a dry reagent dipstick format (strip) and does not require special instrumentation. Universal primers are used for PCR of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The biotinylated amplification product is hybridized with dA-tailed probes that are specific for six pathogens commonly involved in periprosthetic joint infections. The mixture is applied to the strip, which is then immersed in the appropriate buffer. The buffer migrates along the strip by capillary action and rehydrates gold nanoparticles with oligo(dT) strands attached to their surface. The nanoparticles bind to the target DNA through hybridization, and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone of the strip, producing a characteristic red line. Unbound nanoparticles are captured by immobilized oligo(dT) strands at the control zone of the strip, generating a second line. The dipstick test was applied to the detection of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faesium, and Haemophilus influenza. Twelve samples of synovial fluids from patients were analyzed for the detection and identification of the infection caused by the six pathogens. The results were compared with bacterial cultures.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic discharging ears in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aerobic bacteria in chronic discharging ears and determine their antibiotic susceptibilities, which is essential for reasonable empiric treatment. METHODS: Ear swabs of discharging ears aseptically collected from 102 patients of various age groups attending Ear, Nose, and Throat out-patient clinic at University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital were cultured for bacterial agents using blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar. Culture plates were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 24-48 hours. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological methods. Members of the family enterobacteriaceae were identified using enterotubes. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out for 13 drugs using disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the patients studied were in the age group 0-14 years and there were more male infants than females. Gram negative bacteria comprised 75% of the isolates. Predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (41%), Proteus sp. (22%), Staphylococcus aureus (22%), Escherichia coli and other coliforms (11%). Drug susceptibility profile of the isolates showed that ceftazidime, ceftriazone and gentamycin were most effective drugs in vitro. CONCLUSION: The predominant bacterial agents in chronic discharging ears in Port Harcourt, Nigeria were gram negative bacteria and included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Escherichia coli. Gram positive bacterial constituted 25 percent of the isolates and included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. Ceftazidime, ceftrixone and gentamycin were the most effective drugs in vitro.
TI  - Influence of harvest bacterial contamination on autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells post-transplant.
AB  - Microbiological contamination of manipulated blood products, including hematopoietic progenitors obtained from peripheral blood, is an infrequent but persistent problem in transplant units. The relevance of such contamination in causing patient infection has been reported as insignificant, but the effect on the post-transplant course has not been well documented. We studied the incidence of bacterial contamination in autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplants in two of the bench processing steps, as well as the repercussions in the post-transplant course affecting incidence of infections, transfusion requirements and time to engraftment. A total of 365 aphereses performed on 152 patients were cryopreserved in 617 bags. In 31 of these bags (5.0%), bacterial cultures were positive for Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (31.1%), S. epidermidis (21.9%), Corynebacterium sp. (6.3%), S. warneri (6.3%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.3%), Streptococcus sp. (9.4%), Viridans group Streptococcus (3.1%) and more than one bacteria (Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus plus Corynebacterium) (15.6%). Half of the bags were contaminated at the time of freezing and the others at the time of thawing. The 31 contaminated bags were infused into 17 patients. In five of these the same contaminating bacteria was found. No difference between the two groups of patients (contaminated and non-contaminated) was found on the day the fever started, length of fever, blood transfusion requirements and engraftment, but length of hospitalization was significantly greater in patients receiving contaminated transplants.
TI  - First complete genome sequence of two Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections and is often associated with infections in patients with implanted prosthetic devices. A number of virulence determinants have been identified in S. epidermidis, which are typically acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Due to the high recombination potential, bacteriophages play an important role in these transfer events. Knowledge of phage genome sequences provides insights into phage-host biology and evolution. We present the complete genome sequence and a molecular characterization of two S. epidermidis phages, phiPH15 (PH15) and phiCNPH82 (CNPH82). Both phages belonged to the Siphoviridae family and produced stable lysogens. The PH15 and CNPH82 genomes displayed high sequence homology; however, our analyses also revealed important functional differences. The PH15 genome contained two introns, and in vivo splicing of phage mRNAs was demonstrated for both introns. Secondary structures for both introns were also predicted and showed high similarity to those of Streptococcus thermophilus phage 2972 introns. An additional finding was differential superinfection inhibition between the two phages that corresponded with differences in nucleotide sequence and overall gene content within the lysogeny module. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on all known Siphoviridae, which showed PH15 and CNPH82 clustering with Staphylococcus aureus, creating a novel clade within the S. aureus group and providing a higher overall resolution of the siphophage branch of the phage proteomic tree than previous studies. Until now, no S. epidermidis phage genome sequences have been reported in the literature, and thus this study represents the first complete genomic and molecular description of two S. epidermidis phages.
TI  - An alternative infrared spectroscopy assay for the quantification of polysaccharides in bacterial samples.
AB  - The ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. Therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. The colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. Unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. In this article, we propose an alternative method based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples. The method is based on a systematic treatment of FTIR spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. It is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182 cm(-1). In parallel, the amide II band (1560-1530 cm(-1)) associated with proteins, or the C-H stretching region (2820-3020 cm(-1)) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. Therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide II or C-H stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. This method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and DNA. Results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in biofilms can be identified. The proposed FTIR approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.
TI  - [Clinical results of resection arthroplasty for infected shoulder arthroplasty].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  Various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. We evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. Mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). Bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-S Staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=5 including three S. epidermidis) Streptococcus mitis (n=1) and Citrobacter koseri (n=1). The mean Constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). Subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. Surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. RESULTS: Patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. The objective functional outcome measured with the Constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. This was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. All patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). Patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. Clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. DISCUSSION: Infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. Resection only has a modest clinical effect. Precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. Early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. Functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. This procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. Improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones, inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  - A series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one inhibitors  of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) has been prepared. The 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones show low micromolar IC(50) values versus E. coli MurB and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus GC 1131, Enterococcus faecalis GC 2242, Streptococcus pneumoniae GC 1894, and E. coli GC 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. None of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. Moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by Streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. A partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving MurB potency and MIC values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the C-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one core. Docking studies using FLO and PharmDock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the MurB active site.
TI  - Antibacterial agent discovery using thymidylate synthase biolibrary screening.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS, ThyA) catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate, an essential precursor for DNA synthesis. A specific inhibition of this enzyme induces bacterial cell death. As a second round lead optimization design, new 1,2-naphthalein derivatives have been synthesized and tested against a TS-based biolibrary, including human thymidylate synthase (hTS). Docking studies have been performed to rationalize the experimentally observed affinity profiles of 1,2-naphthalein compounds toward Lactobacillus casei TS and hTS. The best TS inhibitors have been tested against a number of clinical isolates of Gram-positive-resistant bacterial strains. Compound 3,3-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1H,3H-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1-one (5) showed significant antibacterial activity, no in vitro toxicity, and dose-response effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC=0.5-2.5 microg/mL) clinical isolate strains, which are resistant to at least 17 of the best known antibacterial agents, including vancomycin. So far this compound can be regarded as a leading antibacterial agent.
TI  - Surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. We performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. METHODS: All procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. There were 155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. RESULTS: One patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by Staphylococcus schleiferi. The patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. One patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees C) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. One patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. A group A Streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. In the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus constellatus. No antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. CONCLUSION: In our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. Continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. Prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. Therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.
TI  - Microchip-based one step DNA extraction and real-time PCR in one chamber for rapid pathogen identification.
AB  - Optimal detection of a pathogen present in biological samples depends on the ability to extract DNA molecules rapidly and efficiently. In this paper, we report a novel method for efficient DNA extraction and subsequent real-time detection in a single microchip by combining laser irradiation and magnetic beads. By using a 808 nm laser and carboxyl-terminated magnetic beads, we demonstrate that a single pulse of 40 seconds lysed pathogens including E. coli and Gram-positive bacterial cells as well as the hepatitis B virus mixed with human serum. We further demonstrate that the real-time pathogen detection was performed with pre-mixed PCR reagents in a real-time PCR machine using the same microchip, after laser irradiation in a hand-held device equipped with a small laser diode. These results suggest that the new sample preparation method is well suited to be integrated into lab-on-a-chip application of the pathogen detection system.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Role of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the use of commercially available triamcinolone acetonide as adjunct treatment for acute-onset endophthalmitis after intraocular procedures. METHODS: Charts of 14 patients who received intravitreal triamcinolone in combination with intravitreal antibiotics for treatment of acute endophthalmitis were reviewed. Patients were included if they presented with pain, vision loss, and severe anterior chamber reaction or hypopyon. Visual acuities, intraocular pressures, anterior chamber reaction, and view of fundus details were recorded at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months to 5 months. RESULTS: Culture-positive results were found for 57% (8/14) of patients. Isolated species included Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococcus, group D Streptococcus (nonenterococcus), Propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid bacilli. Visual acuities improved an average of 7.5 Snellen lines. Preendophthalmitis level visual acuities were recovered in 78.6% patients (11/14), with 64% (9/14) of patients achieving visual acuity of 20/40 or better regardless of presenting vision. Resolution of anterior chamber reaction and view of fundus details were consistent with visual acuities. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal triamcinolone combined with intravitreal antibiotics appears to have a safety profile similar to current modalities with a favorable effect on visual recovery and function in the setting of acute postoperative endophthalmitis.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - Bacterial endophthalmitis after resident-performed cataract surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if there is an increased rate of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis after resident-performed cataract extraction relative to the reported rates of experienced surgeons. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. METHODS: The operative reports of the resident-performed cataract surgeries at San Francisco General Hospital between 1983 and 2002 were reviewed. Cases of culture-positive bacterial endophthalmitis and vitreous loss were identified. RESULTS: Between 1983 and 2002, three cases (0.11%) of culture-positive bacterial endophthalmitis occurred after 2718 resident-performed cataract extractions. The overall vitreous loss rate was 6.7%. Two endophthalmitis cases were acute (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans), presenting within five days of surgeries complicated by vitreous loss, and one case was delayed-onset (Corynebacterium species) after Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy after uncomplicated cataract extraction. CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher rates of vitreous loss, the rate of endophthalmitis following resident-performed cataract surgery remains comparable with the rates of more experienced surgeons.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic bacterial vaginal isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic bacterial isolates from high vaginal swab cultures. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, from January 2003 to February 2004. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects included 136 symptomatic women attending Obstetrics and Gynecology Out-Patient Department. A proforma was filled to document the demographic details, presenting complaint and examination findings. High vaginal swabs were taken for gram staining, culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing using standard microbiologic techniques. RESULTS: Normal flora was isolated in 30% of the cases, followed by Candida spp. (21.3%), Enterococcus spp. (14.7%), E.coli (10.2%), Beta hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (7.3%), Staphylococcus spp. (4.4%), Enterobacter spp. (4.4%), while Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella spp. were isolated 1.5% each. Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were mostly sensitive to penicillin and amoxicillin while E.coli and Klebsiella were sensitive to (piperacillin-Tazobactum, Imipenem and vancomycin. Enterococci species showed significant resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (68.8% to 81.3%) resistance to vancomycin was 5%. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent of symptomatic patients had normal flora on culture. Candida spp was the most frequent pathogen isolated. Co-amoxiclav should be used as empiric therapy until culture-sensitivity report is available.
TI  - Vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (Vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the Infectious Diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. Among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. Antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: Eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. The median age of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. Solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. Six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including 2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group G streptococci (n = 2 patients), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). All isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. Rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). None of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to Vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.
TI  - Bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in Africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. The reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in SS disease in Africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. METHODS: A study of blood cultures in 155 Ugandan children (165 episodes) with SS disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees C, attending the University Teaching Hospital in Kampala (Uganda, East Africa). RESULTS: Positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed Staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, Haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli and an unidentified Gram negative rod. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. CONCLUSION: The infrequent isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with SS disease in this study and in four other studies from Nigeria raises questions on a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. There are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. These data are necessary to determine its role in African children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial Africa.
TI  - Promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pA-V-F) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. The vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in D-Ala-D-Ala. The fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. Flow cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled S. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled S. pneumoniae were opsonized. The bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured J774 macrophage-like cells. Flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested S. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than S. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of S. aureus by macrophages). This paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of Gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in atheromatous plaques by quantitative PCR.
AB  - This is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial DNA from ten species, including periodontal species and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We examined 129 samples of DNA extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from ten different species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola and C. pneumoniae. All determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods employing SYBR Green. Species from the Bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. Almost half of the samples contained DNA from A. a. and C. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. S. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. The proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic DNA. The data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. We conclude that DNA from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of C. pneumoniae to the inflammation may be minimal.
TI  - Interference in adhesion of bacteria and yeasts isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber by rhamnolipid biosurfactants.
AB  - AIMS: The effects and extent of adhesion of four different bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed rhamnolipid biosurfactant layer obtained from Pseudomonasaeruginosa DS10-129 was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of rhamnolipid biosurfactant to inhibit adhesion of micro-organisms to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The anti-adhesive activity of the biosurfactant at different concentrations was significant against all the strains and depended on the micro-organism tested. The results showed an effective reduction in the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all micro-organisms tested at the 4 g l(-1) undiluted rhamnolipid solution. Maximum initial reduction of adhesion rate (an average of 66%) occurred for Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9. The number of cells adhering after 4 h on silicone rubber conditioned with biosurfactant was reduced to 48% for Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6, Strep. salivarius GB 24/9, Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9 in comparison to controls. Perfusing the flow chamber with biosurfactant containing solution followed by the passage of a liquid-air interface, to investigate detachment of micro-organisms adhering to silicone rubber, produced high detachment (96%) of adhered cells for all micro-organisms studied, except for Staph. aureus GB 2/1 (67%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is concluded that biosurfactant represent suitable compounds that should be considered in developing future strategies to prevent the microbial colonization of silicone rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - An in vitro antimicrobial comparison of miswak extract with commercially available non-alcohol mouthrinses.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of eight commercially available mouthrinses and 50% miswak extract against seven microorganisms. Corsodyl, Alprox, Oral-B advantage, Florosept, Sensodyne, Aquafresh Mint, Betadine and Emoform mouthrinses were used while 50% aqueous extract of miswak (Salvadora persica) was used against Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The ditch plate method was used to test the antimicrobial activity. Inhibition zones of microorganisms around ditches were measured in millimetres. Range, mean and standard deviations were used for comparison of antimicrobial activity. Mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine was with maximum antibacterial activity, while cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses were with moderate and miswak extract was with low antibacterial activity. Further research is needed for the substantivity of these mouthrinses and further in vivo/in vitro studies are needed using Biofilm model to substantiate present findings. Dental professionals must exercise caution and provide guidance in assisting their patients in making informed choices regarding their use of mouthrinses for clinical efficacy.
TI  - 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, novel inhibitors of UDP-N- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB) with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB). Compounds 1 to 3, which are 1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited Escherichia coli MurB, Staphyloccocus aureus MurB, and E. coli MurA with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microM, 4.3 to 10.3 microM, and 6.8 to 29.4 microM, respectively. Compound 4, a C-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. coli MurB, S. aureus MurB, and E. coli MurC (IC50s, 24.5 to 35 microM). A fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with E. coli MurB, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nM. Structural characterization of E. coli MurB was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of MurB and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with IC50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microM. Antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (MICs, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (MICs, 4 to 8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Clarithromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of clarithromycin metal complexes has been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of clarithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium has been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with clarithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition. of complexes against both gram negative and gram positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhii, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentary, Kelebcilla pneumoni and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of clarithromycin complexes results in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of clarithromycin increases with respect to parent clarithromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - PCR evaluation of false-positive signals from two automated blood-culture systems.
AB  - Rapid detection of micro-organisms from blood is one of the most critical functions of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. Automated blood-culture systems reduce the time needed to detect positive cultures, and reduce specimen handling. The false-positive rate of such systems is 1-10%. In this study, the presence of pathogens in 'false-positive' bottles obtained from BACTEC 9050 (Becton Dickinson) and BacT/Alert (Biomerieux) systems was investigated by eubacterial and fungal PCR. A total of 169 subculture-negative aerobic blood-culture bottles (104 BacT/Alert and 65 BACTEC) were evaluated. Both fungal and eubacterial PCRs were negative for all BACTEC bottles. Fungal PCR was also negative for the BacT/Alert system, but 10 bottles (9.6%) gave positive results by eubacterial PCR. Sequence analysis of the positive PCR amplicons indicated the presence of the following bacteria (number of isolates in parentheses): Pasteurella multocida (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Staphylococcus hominis (1), Micrococcus sp. (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Corynebacterium spp. (2), Brachibacterium sp. (1) and Arthrobacter/Rothia sp. (1). Antibiotic usage by the patients may be responsible for the inability of the laboratory to grow these bacteria on subcultures. For patients with more than one false-positive bottle, molecular methods can be used to evaluate the microbial DNA in these bottles. False positives from the BACTEC system may be due to elevated patient leukocyte counts or the high sensitivity of the system to background increases in CO(2) concentration.
TI  - Novel 4-N-substituted aryl pent-2-ene-1,4-dione derivatives of piperazinyloxazolidinones as antibacterials.
AB  - A few substituted piperazinylphenyloxazolidinone compounds 6-13 having substitution on the distant nitrogen atom of piperazine ring scaffold have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity in Gram-positive bacteria. A few compounds showed superior in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes than linezolid and eperezolid.
TI  - Novel synthetic molecules targeting the bacterial RNA polymerase assembly.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite extensive functional screening of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) over the past years, very few novel inhibitors have been reported. We have, therefore, decided to screen with a radically different, non-enzymic, protein-protein interaction assay. Our target is the highly conserved RNAP-sigma interaction that is essential for transcription. METHODS: Small molecule inhibitors of the RNAP-sigma interaction were tested for their activity on transcription and on bacteria. RESULTS: These compounds have antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including multiresistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first example of a small molecule inhibitor of this interaction.
TI  - Etiology of implant orthopedic infections: a survey on 1027 clinical isolates.
AB  - In spite of the recent achievements derived from modern protocols of prophylaxis, orthopedic surgical infections still remain unacceptably frequent, especially in light of the often devastating outcomes of septic complications. The spectrum and the prevalence of the bacteria most frequently involved in orthopedic infections are here explored, with particular reference to those infections associated to implant biomaterials, which were grouped based on device typology. During a 30 months period (from September 2000 to April 2003), 1027 microbial strains were consecutively isolated from 699 patients undergoing revision surgery at the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute. 775 (75.5%) of all these microorganisms were identified as belonging to the Staphylococcus genus, 82 (8%) to the Enterobacteriaceae family, 75 (7.3%) to the Pseudomonas genus, 54 (5.3%) to the Enterococcus genus and 20 (1.9%) to the Streptococcus genus. While confirming the importance of staphylococci as the most diffuse cause of infection, our data indicate an unexpectedly high prevalence of S. epidermidis on infected hip and knee arthroprostheses, respectively of 42% and 44%. The spectrum of bacteria infecting either internal or external fracture fixation devices appears to differ from that of hip and knee arthroprostheses and more closely resembles that of infections non-associated to medical devices, being characterized by a relatively higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (over 40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteriaceae and members of the Streptococcus and Corynebacterium genera are frequently associated with implants in which surgical incisions were made near the perineum, determining a completely altered spectrum.
TI  - Environmental contamination before, during, and after dental treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE: To verify environmental contamination by collecting microorganisms from  dental equipment surfaces before, during and after clinical procedures. METHODS: Sterile swabs were used to collect the samples from dental-chair push buttons, 3-in-1 syringes, X-ray tubes, computer keys, doorknobs, and light handles before (P1), during (P2) and after (P3) clinical procedures, in the undergraduate clinic of the Dental School of Piracicaba, University of Campinas, Brazil. These samples were spread on BHI agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Other dishes containing the same material were incubated at 37 degrees C in 10% CO2 for 48 hours. The resulting microorganisms were counted and classified using the Gram staining and biochemical tests. Microorganism counts among the periods and groups were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=5%). RESULTS: The most prevalent microorganisms were Viridans group streptococci, Sthaphylococcus epidermidis and Baccillus subtilis. Push buttons were the most contaminated (P< 0.05). Microorganisms were most prevalent during clinical procedures (P< 0.05). Microorganism counts were higher in P2 than in P1 and P3 (P< 0.05). Clinical activity caused an increase in the number of environmental microorganisms, where Viridans group streptococci were the most prevalent contaminant found on equipment surfaces.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the LEADER 2004 surveillance program.
AB  - Since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has been gained. However, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the United States has not been reported. The LEADER 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. Organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 Staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 428 Enterococcus faecalis, 196 Enterococcus faecium, and 422 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All S. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 = 2 microg/ml); MIC distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. For CNS, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered (Staphylococcus epidermidis; MIC = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the MIC(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with S. aureus. For E. faecalis and E. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. Both species had an MIC90 of 2 microg/ml, and MIC distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. Linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the S. pneumoniae isolates. These findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. Nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.
TI  - A study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. Multiple site cultures may improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. We hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. DESIGN/METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis. A minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. Based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. RESULTS: A total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. In all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. In all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. All neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. The other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. The single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by Listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3), combined MRSA and Candida albicans (2), Candida albicans alone (2), late-onset Group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GBS) (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Enterococcus fecalis (1), Escherichia coli (1), and Serratia marcescens (1). Since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. CONCLUSIONS: Two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. Sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood volume of>or=1 ml.
TI  - [Trend of antimicrobial drug-susceptibility of blood isolates at an oncological center (1998-2003)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the Bactec and Microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. The percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were Gram negative bacteria, 35.7% Gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. E. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and Klebsiella spp (9%). Throughout the study the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli stayed around 50%. Susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. S. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for vancomycin was 98.6%. No strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. Our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. METHODS: The experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. Standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. RESULTS: We found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus salivarius or Actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a pH-dependent manner. The results of experiments with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. However, direct fluoride inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. Results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to those of S. salivarius with pH-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and indirect inhibition of urease. CONCLUSION: Fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp.HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC(50) of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was approximately 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin-inflammation and acne.
TI  - [Synthesis of derivatives of (9S)-12-methylene erythromycin and their antibacterial activity in vitro].
AB  - AIM: To synthesizs of derivatives of (9S)-12-methylene erythromycin possessed potent antibacterial activity. METHODS: Using erythromycin A as a starting material, via two intermediate compounds protected 12,21-dehydroerythromycin A and 6,7: 12,21-didehydro erythromycin A, several 9-O, 11-O-ethylidene compounds were obtained. During this process, benzyl and isopropyl have been selected as the protecting group. The structures of compounds obtained were confirmed with 13C NMR and MS-FAB. Their antibacterial activity in vitro was tested. RESULTS: Eleven derivatives of erythromycin were synthesized. Five of them were unknown compounds. CONCLUSION: The preliminary biological test showed that two target compounds exhibited less potent antibacterial activity in vitro.
TI  - Increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  - In a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10% fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. In the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Streptococcus group B, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of bacteria isolated from patients with chronic sinusitis (CR) and antibiotic-resistance. METHODS: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 76 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi, then the antimicrobial susceptibility test and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (beta-LPB) were detected. In the control group, the discharges from the nasal cavity from 10 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. RESULTS: Twenty species, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-Hemolytic streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of aerobe, anaerobe, gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 83.4%, 16.6%, 56.3% and 43.7%, respectively. The fungi was only detected in 1.4% patients. The antimicrobial susceptibility test demonstrated that Imipenem, Cefotaxime and Amoxicillin-clavulanate were good in vitro activity to aerobic pathogens and Metronidazole, Imipenem and Chloramphenicol was good to anaerobic pathogens. The beta-LPB was detected in 37.7% strains in which Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-Hemolytic streptococcus and Branhamella catarrhalis were more frequent. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli etc were cultured from the control group. There was no significant difference of distribution of the same bacteria between the control group and the testing group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenic bacteria of CR mostly involve aerobes. The antibiotics-resistance of these pathogen is serious. The bacterial infection plays no leading role in CR, so the need of antibiotics should not be excessively emphasized. Before treatment by antibiotics, the antimicrobial susceptibility test should be performed. The broad-spectrum antibiotics containing beta-lactamase inhibitor such as Cefotaxime and Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended in condition that the test can not be finished.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of REP8839, a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  - REP8839 is a novel methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetS) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. All isolates of S. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid were susceptible to REP8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. REP8839 was also active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (MIC, < or =0.25 microg/ml). All S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to REP8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that MetS2, a second enzyme previously identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present in this organism. REP8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by pH, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak acidic medium. Like mupirocin, REP8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against key pathogens. The emergence of mupirocin resistance in S. aureus highlights the need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.
TI  - [Study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. METHODS: For all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time CSF was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to antibiotics. After the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. As soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. By the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. RESULTS: Among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with Streptococci, and another one with Mycobacterium stercoris bovis. The tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. There were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. Practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of streptococcal infection. The duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. Finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. CONCLUSION: (1)Intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)The effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)There are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - PD-140248 (Parke-Davis & Co).
AB  - PD-140248 is an isomerase inhibitor and topoisomerase II inhibitor under development by Parke-Davis and Co as a potential treatment for bacterial infection. Although no details of active development have been published in the scientific literature since 1996, in September 1999, the company confirmed that PD-140248 is still in active development [338530]. The compound is one of two new pyrrolidinyl naphthyridines (the other compound being PD-131628) with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria. PD-140248 demonstrates strong in vitro activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S epidermidis), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (S haemolyticus), methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis (E faecalis). An MIC90 value of 0.015 microg/ml was obtained against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) and Moraxella catarrhalis [160129]. The (3R,1S) enantiomer, PD-140248, demonstrated a 1- to 10-fold enhanced activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in vitro and in vivo compared to its stereoisomers, and has thus been targeted for further preclinical studies [133377].
TI  - Evaluation of pooled cultures for bacterial detection in whole blood-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) system is highly efficient for bacterial  detection in apheresis platelets (PLTs) and whole blood-derived PLTs produced by the buffy-coat method. Detection of bacterial contamination in whole blood-derived PLTs produced by the PLT-rich plasma (PRP) method, however, is problematic. Prestorage pooling of these PLTs is not permitted in some countries including Canada and the United States, and culturing individual units is costly and may significantly reduce the PLT unit content. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of BacT/ALERT cultures performed on pools derived from PRP PLTs are reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT system was evaluated for bacterial detection in PRP PLTs with a dilution effect. Thirty PLT pools were produced with 1 PLT unit previously spiked with bacteria and then pooled with other four nonspiked PLT units. Three bacteria, usually associated with PLT contamination, were selected for spiking. The specificity of this method was evaluated in 40 nonspiked PLT pools. RESULTS: The method was found to be 100 percent specific and 97 percent sensitive. Of the five spiked pools with Streptococcus pneumoniae at levels of less than 2 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL, four were found to be positive whereas all 25 spiked pools with greater than 9 CFUs per mL of any of the chosen bacteria gave positive results. The mean time of detection was 17 to 19 hours for Staphylococcus epidermidis and 14 to 15 hours for S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when spiked with similar bacterial inocula. CONCLUSION: The evaluated system is highly sensitive and specific and may be a feasible method for bacterial detection in PRP PLTs.
TI  - [Abscess of the spleen].
AB  - Splenic abscess is a rare disease but with increasing frequency. The authors present 9 patients with splenic abscess treated at the Institute of Digestive System Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, in a period from January 1, 1986 to May 15, 2004. Splenic abscess was the complication of septic endocarditis in 4, trauma in 2, dental infection in 1, while in 2 cases it was the complication of chemotherapy in myeloproliferative disorders. All 9 patients had fever, 7 - abdominal pain, 4 - left shoulder pain, and 1 patient had nausea and vomiting. Higher white blood count was found in 6 patients, pleural effusion in 4, elevated left hemidiaphragm in 1 and basal pneumonia in 1 patient as well. Ultrasonography and CT were the most reliable diagnostic procedures. CT was superior in diagnosis of multiple small abscesses. Culture of the pus recovered the Enterococcus in 3 cases, Streptococcus a hemolyticus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans in 1, Staphylococcus aureus, E. Coil and Candida albicans in 1, Staphylococcus aureus i Salmonella enteritidis in 1 case. Eight patients underwent splenectomy and 1 was cured by combined antibiotics in high doses. One patient died postoperatively due to septic endocarditis that had been present before surgery. The authors believe that splenectomy and antibiotics administered according to drug susceptibility test as well as management of underlying disease are the method of choice for splenic abscess treatment. Conservative antibiotic treatment is indicated in selected cases only.
TI  - [Identification of bacterial flora of conjunctival sac in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children].
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the species of the microorganisms and their susceptibility to antibiotics in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pus secretion after lacrimal sac massage was obtained from 81 children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The laboratory diagnostics was performed using typical microbiological procedures. The modification of these procedures was 24-hour pre-incubation in sugar boullion. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (28%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%). The isolated staphylococci (only coagulase-negative species MRSE) were resistant to methicillin in 2 cases. Streptococci were obtained in 20% isolations: Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), Streptococcus viridans (6%). Gram-negative bacilli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella spp. and Candida albicans were isolated in a few cases. Negative results of the cultures were obtained in 25% cases. CONCLUSIONS: The microorganisms typically constituting physiological flora of conjunctival sac may become the pathogens in the complications of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The fixed combination of fortified vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solution--VA solution: in vitro study of the potency and stability.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the in vitro potency and stability of a fixed combination of vancomycin and amikacin solution (VA solution) with amikacin or vancomycin solution. METHODS: Solutions of 2% amikacin (20 mg/mL) and of 5% vancomycin (50 mg/mL) and VA solution (each 1 mL contained 20 mg of amikacin and 50 mg of vancomycin) were prepared from parenteral antibiotics by reconstituting them with sterile injection water and refrigerated (4 degrees C) in the dark. Triplicate 5-mL portions of each solution were tested before storage and 7 and 14 days after preparation for potency of antimicrobial activity by the disk diffusion method and for stability. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the diameter of zones of inhibition of VA solution compared with amikacin or vancomycin solution within a 2-week period. Visual inspection revealed that all solutions remained clear, colorless, and particle-free at 4 degrees C throughout the study period. For osmolarity, the VA solution was much higher than that of either amikacin or vancomycin solution at all tested times and more near the well-tolerated range of human eyes. There were no significant differences at days 0, 7, or 14 for either vancomycin, amikacin, or VA solution. For pH, the VA solution was higher than that of vancomycin solution (nearly equal to that of amikacin solution) at each time and more near the level of normal tear film. The pH did not differ significantly for either vancomycin, amikacin, or VA solution at all tested times. CONCLUSIONS: The vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solutions can be mixed together with the same potency and stable physical properties. It may be useful in the treatment of bacterial keratitis pending clinical trials to determine its effectiveness and safety.
TI  - Repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  - Repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. We used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. The agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10 [77%] of 13 cases).
TI  - Antimicrobial potency of alkali ion substituted calcium phosphate cements.
AB  - Potassium and sodium containing nanoapatite cements were produced by the reaction of mechanically activated CaNaPO(4) (CSP), CaKPO(4) (CPP) and Ca(2)KNa(PO(4))(2) (CPCP) with a 2.5% Na(2)HPO(4) solution. The cements exhibited clinically acceptable setting times of approximately 5 min and compressive strengths of 5-10 MPa. The antimicrobial properties of the cements were tested with the agar diffusion test using Streptococcus salvarius, Staphylococcus epidermis and Candida albicans. All types of alkali ion containing cements showed a significantly higher antimicrobial potency with inhibition zones of approx. 4-11 mm than a commercial calcium hydroxide cement which resulted in small inhibition zones around the cement samples of a maximum of 1.5 mm. The antimicrobial properties of all the cements were not found to diminish even after longer incubation times. This behaviour was attributed to the formation of soluble alkaline metal phosphates during setting which increased the pH value in the agar gel around the alkali containing calcium phosphate cement to 8.5-10.7 compared to 6.5-8.0 for the Ca(OH)(2) product. The high antimicrobial potency of alkali-calcium phosphate cements may find an application in dentistry as pulp capping agents, root fillers or cavity liners.
TI  - The streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  - Antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group A molecules and group B molecules, acting in synergy. The combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group A or group B molecule alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. The semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. The streptogramins block the translation of mRNA into protein. Both group A and group B molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. The group B molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. The group A molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and the formation of the peptide bond. When the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group A molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the ribosome for the B molecule is increased. This accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. This synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group B molecules alone.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Homograft reconstruction of the aortic root for endocarditis with periannular abscess: a 17-year study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to evaluate the long-term results of homograft reconstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract with a cryopreserved aortic homograft in the presence of aortic root abscess associated with a biofilm bacterial infection. METHODS: Between January 1987 and December 2003, 161 patients with aortic root abscess underwent freehand aortic valve (FAVR, N = 78) and aortic root replacement (ARR, N = 83) with an antibiotic treated cryopreserved aortic homograft. Their mean age was 53.1+/-15.6 years. Endocarditis of the native valve was found in 80 patients and of the prosthetic valve in 81; of the prosthetic valves 49 (60.5%) were mechanical and 32 (39%) bioprosthetic. Aortic ventricular discontinuity was found in 83 patients. The common responsible microorganisms were the biofilm bacteria: Staphylococcus (S. epidermidis: 34, S. aureus: 13) in 47 patients followed by Enterococcus in 23 and Streptococcus in 39. Surgery was urgent in 80 patients and emergent in 81, of whom 44 were in cardiogenic shock. Follow-up totaled 810.8 patient-years (mean: 5.0+/-4.3 years) and was 100% complete. RESULTS: Operative mortality was 9.3% for elective/urgent and 14.3% for emergency surgery. A total of 7.3% patients died after hospital discharge during the 17-year follow-up period. The actuarial patient survival at 17 years was 70.4+/-3.6%. Early and late residual/recurrent infections and paravalvular leaks occurred in 4.3 and 2.5%, respectively. Reoperations were carried out in 30 patients, 11 for residual/recurrent infection and paravalvular leaks. Twenty-one patients with FAVR and 9 with ARR techniques underwent reoperation. Early reoperation rate was 4.3%. The actuarial freedom from residual/recurrent infection and paravalvular leaks was 91.6+/-2.4%. Actuarial freedom from reoperation at 17 years was 75+/-3.7%. It was 82.9+/-5.5% for ARR and 63.5+/-6.7% for AAVR technique. The actuarial freedom from structural valve deterioration (SVD) at 17 years was 98.6+/-0.4.% at a rate of %/patient-year. CONCLUSIONS: Radical debridement of the infected aortic root and homograft ARR offer a low recurrent infection rate and an overall low valve-related morbidity and mortality for up to 17 years. The antibiotic permeable cryopreserved homograft has proven to be resistant to biofilm bacterial infection.
TI  - Staphylococcus sciuri: an unusual cause of pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - We present the case of polymicrobial pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that involved Staphylococcus sciuri, S. epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In order to determine the frequency of S. sciuri isolation from the female lower genital tract, 3415 vaginal samples were analysed during the one-year study period. S. sciuri was isolated from three (0.09%) samples. In all the three cases, S. sciuri was obtained in mixed culture from outpatients without symptoms of infection. While the origin of S. sciuri in the female genital tract remains to be elucidated, the present study showed that this bacterium may colonize vagina and, moreover, may be involved in the pathogenesis of an infection as serious as PID. The low rate of isolation we established, however, indicates infrequent and, most probably, transient colonization of the female genital tract by S. sciuri.
TI  - [Multiple cerebral abscess caused by Nocardia brasilientis].
AB  - Streptococcus aureus, streptococci, and enterobacteria were major causative agents of abscesses of the brain. At present, associated infection is responsible for 60% of cerebral abscesses. When systemic and specific immunities are diminished, a risk for cerebral abscesses caused by fungi increases. Among them, there are the most common fungi Candida species or Aspergillus species. The paper gives an example of successful complex treatment of multiple cerebral abscesses caused by an association of Nocardia brasiliensis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The specific feature of the observation was the correct diagnosis before intraoperative verification of cerebral abscesses. The disease developed in the presence of diminished systemic immunity and in the absence of specific immunity to Nocardia. Immunodeficiency could be caused by prior herpetic infection, Epstein-Barr disease, a wasp bite. The pathogen that was able to cause microstrokes played an indubitable role in the pathogenesis of the disease, which predisposed to the development of cerebral abscesses in patients with immunodeficiency. Impaired blood circulation in the occipital region could be also induced by wasp venom.
TI  - [Bacterial contamination in blood and blood products].
AB  - Skin disinfection during phlebotomy is a critical step for bacterial contamination of blood and blood products. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contamination rates during phlebotomy and to detect the probable microorganisms present. Skin disinfections of 100 blood donors were performed by using povidone iodine solution with standard procedure. Fifteen mililiters of blood samples were drawn from the transfusion set and inoculated into culture flasks of automated Bact/Alert (BioMerieux) system. Blood cultures were monitorized for one week, and bacteria in positive cultures were identified by using classical microbiological methods in addition with API identification system (BioMerieux; ID32 Staph, 20 Strep). As a result, bacterial growth was detected in four (4%) of the blood samples, whereas 96% of the samples were found sterile. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the microorganism which had been grown in three of the samples, and Streptococcus mutans in one. The positivity rate detected in our study was considered high, since expected bacterial contamination rates in blood transfusions were between 0.2-0.5%. This data indicated that the procedures used in phlebotomy such as the choice of phlebotomy region, disinfectant use and disinfection time should be re-evaluated in our blood centre.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Trends in linezolid susceptibility patterns in 2002: report from the worldwide Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program.
AB  - Oxazolidinones have become reliable clinical and candidate antimicrobial agents to be utilized for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. However, mutational resistance of the ribosomal target has been described for several species. Longitudinal surveillance remains necessary to monitor for this evolving linezolid resistance pattern. A survey of linezolid and several comparison Gram-positive focused agents was initiated in 2002 (7971 strains, >99.0% compliance) for 54 participating sites in the United States, Canada, Europe (6 nations), Latin America (2 nations), and the Asia Pacific (2 nations). The 5 and 25 sites in Canada and the United States, respectively, submitted 200 strains each to a central laboratory for organism identification/confirmation and reference MIC processing. The 10 remaining nations had 200 strain samples from 1 to 4 separate institutions. Linezolid resistance (MIC >/= 8 microg/mL) was confirmed by alternative susceptibility testing methods (Etest, AB BIO Disk, Solna, Sweden; disk diffusion method) and target mutation characterization by PCR and sequence analysis. Linezolid activity against the 6 major organism groups did not vary between geographic areas. A total of 98.1% of linezolid MIC values were between 0.5 and 2 microg/mL, and only 0.5% of results were at 4 microg/mL, which included 32 Staphylococcus aureus (0.9%) and 5 (0.5%) enterococcal isolates. Linezolid resistance was detected in only 4 isolates (0.05%): 1 each Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and a viridans group Streptococcus. All 4 isolates had a G2576U mutation in the 23S rRNA target. Linezolid activity as outlined by these Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program results demonstrate sustained, near complete activity against contemporary Gram-positive isolates on 4 monitored continents and in centers utilizing oxazolidinones. Rare linezolid-resistant strains were identified in the United States only (0.05% resistance overall).
TI  - Detailed bacteriologic tests to identify the origin of transvenous pacing system  infections indicate a high prevalence of multiple organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The reported incidence of pacing system-related infections (PSIs) varies widely, and the roles of leads and blood cultures remain poorly defined. METHODS: Leads and blood cultures were obtained prospectively in 224 patients with suspected PSIs, and the results of cultures of blood and extravascular and intravascular lead fragments were compared. RESULTS: In 12.3% of the patients, no microorganism was found on the leads. Lead cultures with > or =1 microorganism cultured on the extravascular and intravascular fragments of the leads were found in 88.5% of the positive lead cultures. Infection was caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and coagulase-negative staphylococci in 66.0% and 29.5%, respectively. Only 33 patients had positive blood cultures according to the Duke criteria with the same microorganism found by lead cultures in 30 cases. Infection was caused by multiple organisms in 39 (25%) patients. CONCLUSION: (1) Regardless of the clinical presentation, the extravascular and intravascular body of the lead is infected, even when the infection is local. More than one microorganism may be implicated. (2) Bacteriologic analyses must be performed on several segments of each implanted lead. (3) More than 2 positive blood cultures are a reliable clinical criterion for the diagnosis of pacemaker lead-related infection, but blood cultures alone are an insensitive method to identify the cause of infection. (4) Up to 50% of microorganisms isolated in a single blood culture are also recovered in lead cultures.
TI  - [Nosocomial bacteremia: epidemiology and current antimicrobial drugs resistances].
AB  - Nosocomial bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A change is being observed in the distribution of its causative agents, as well as an increase in the resistances to some antimicrobial drugs. We have analyzed 600 significant bacteremia episodes during the year 2002, studying the resistances to antimicrobial drugs and some epidemiological aspects. Bacteremias caused by gram-positive were 57%, while the ones caused by gram-negative were 46.1%. The three microorganisms more frequently isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In S. aureus low resistance to oxacillin (10.3%) was observed. Streptococcus pneumoniae with lower sensitivity to penicillin was observed in 49.9%. Resistance of gram-positive microorganisms to vancomycin/teicoplanin was not observed. E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed low prevalence of expanded spectrum ss-lactamase strains. There are differences in epidemiology of bacteremias at regional level, and continuous local programs for monitoring resistances to antimicrobial drugs are needed.

TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - Successful liver and kidney transplantation from cadaveric donors with left-sided bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Bacterial infections are frequent in cadaveric organ donors and can be transmitted to the transplantation recipient, which could have devastating consequences for the recipients if adequate preventive measures are not adopted. From the 355 consecutive brain dead cadaveric organ donors procured at our center in the last four years, 2000-2003, four of them (1.1%) had bacterial endocarditis as cause of death. The bacteria responsible for the endocarditis were Staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus hominis and Streptococcus viridans, respectively. We performed five kidney and two liver transplantations on seven recipients. All donors and recipients received antibiotic treatment against the germ causing the respective endocarditis. Infection by the bacteria responsible for the endocarditis in the respective donors was not transmitted to any of the recipients. Six of the seven recipients were alive with normal-functioning grafts after between 13 and 24 months' follow-up. Transplantectomy was performed on one kidney recipient due to thrombosis of the renal vein of the graft not related to the endocarditis. Liver and kidney transplantation from donors dying from bacterial endocarditis can be performed without causing the transmission of infection to the recipient or the dysfunction of the graft.
TI  - In vitro activity of 24 antimicrobial agents against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus isolated from diseased animals in Japan.
AB  - A total of 88 Staphylococcus and 61 Streptococcus isolates from diseased animals  throughout Japan were examined in 2000 for the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 24 different antimicrobials by the agar dilution method standardized by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. The resistance rates to aminobenzylpenicillin (36.4%) and benzylpenicillin (35.2%) were high in Staphylococcus isolates, and those to oxytetracycline (45.9%) and kanamycin (21.3%) were high in Streptococcus isolates. Two isolates resistant to oxacillin harbored the mecA gene. One was Staphylococcus epidermidis derived from a pig with arthritis, and the other Staphylococcus cohnii from a head of cattle with mastitis.
TI  - Production of bacteriocins by coagulase-negative staphylococci involved in bovine mastitis.
AB  - In the present study, 188 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) strains were isolated from bovine mastitis cases from 56 different Brazilian dairy herds, located in the Southeast region of the country, and were tested for antimicrobial substance production. Twelve CNS strains (6.4%) exhibited antagonistic activity against a Corynebacterium fimi indicator strain. Most antimicrobial substances were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes suggesting that they might be bacteriocins (Bac). Amongst the CNS producers, six were identified as S. epidermidis, two as S. simulans, two as S. saprophyticus, one as S. hominis and one as S. arlettae. Plasmid profile analysis of these strains revealed the presence of at least one plasmid. The Bac(+) strains presented either no or few antibiotic resistance phenotypes. Three strains were shown to produce a bacteriocin either identical or similar to aureocin A70, a bacteriocin previously isolated from an S. aureus strain isolated from food. The remaining Bac(+) strains produce antimicrobial peptides that seem to be distinct from the best characterised staphylococcal bacteriocins described so far. Some of them were able to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes, an important food-borne pathogen, and several strains of Streptococcus agalactiae associated with bovine mastitis, suggesting a potential use of these bacteriocins either in the prevention or in the treatment of streptococcal mastitis.
TI  - Bacterial populations on silicone hydrogel and hydrogel contact lenses after swimming in a chlorinated pool.
AB  - PURPOSE: A number of reports have indicated an association between swimming with  contact lenses and subsequent eye infection. This study tests whether a hydrophilic contact lens worn while swimming accumulates bacteria present in the water. It was of interest to determine whether lens type (silicone hydrogel vs. hydrogel) affected the result. METHODS: Fifteen healthy noncontact lens wearers swam for 30 minutes with a silicone hydrogel lens (PureVision, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) on one eye and a hydrogel lens (Acuvue 2, Vistakon Inc., Jacksonville, FL) on the other. Lenses were removed aseptically and placed in sterile vials 10 minutes after the subjects left the water. Microbial growth was enumerated for total numbers of colonies and categorized by species present. Numbers of colonies were compared between the two lens groups and with a water sample taken from the pool at the time of the experiment. Eight of the subjects returned on a different day and wore new lenses for 50 minutes in normal room conditions. RESULTS: Two lenses were lost while swimming. Twenty-seven of the remaining 28 lenses worn while swimming showed colonization, principally with Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was also by far the most common species identified from the water itself. Small numbers of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus salivarius were also present in the water and on the lenses. Numbers of colonies varied among subjects (range, 0 to 230), but no differences were observed between the two lens groups. Lenses removed after 30 minutes of wear without swimming were mostly sterile, with 3 of 16 lenses showing just two colonies each. CONCLUSION: It appears that wearing a hydrophilic lens while swimming allows accumulation of microbial organisms on or in the lens, regardless of lens material. Swimmers should be advised to wear tight-fitting goggles if lenses are worn while swimming, and thorough disinfection of the lenses before overnight wear seems prudent.
TI  - Syntheses and antibacterial activity of a series of 3-(pyridine-3-yl)-2-oxazolidinone.
AB  - The syntheses of substituted piperazinyl pyridyl oxazolidinones 8-16 are described. Their in vitro activities against Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and enterococcus were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Compound 8 and 10 were found to be superior to linezolid.
TI  - Interlaboratory proficiency testing as a tool for improving performance in laboratories diagnosing bovine mastitis.
AB  - The National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (Finland) and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency of the Quality Assurance Unit, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, United Kingdom (previously the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) organized a proficiency testing program for laboratories analyzing veterinary mastitis samples. Three test samples with lyophilized strains of common aerobic bacteria were sent to the participating laboratories 7 times between 2000 and 2003. The participants returned 98% of the requested data. The overall performance of the laboratories varied from 63 to 93% in different testing rounds. All laboratories diagnosed Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli correctly at every round. Improvement in diagnosing individual bacteria was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. The overall performance of the laboratories improved with increased participation. The educational role of the program was important. Laboratories working in the veterinary field should implement a documented quality system covering all functions of the laboratory, as well as a planned quality assurance system.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery between September 1 and December 31, 2003. Aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively. Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/mL, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (MIC(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. However, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h vitreous group for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. Moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. The pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous levels can be achieved after topical administration. Further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.
TI  - [Initial antibiotic therapy of neonatal sepsis].
AB  - It is certain that in the past the types of bacterial agents responsible for neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity to antibiotics were not the same in all historical periods. However, the reports confirming the conclusion have been published only in the last three years. According to these facts, the bacterial causes of neonatal sepsis were analyzed in patients treated at the University children's hospital in Belgrade (S&M) as well as their sensitivity to antibiotics to determine the most effective initial therapy. Between January 2001 and June 2004, 35 neonates, aged from 1-30 days, with positive blood culture were treated. Gram-negative bacteria were the cause of sepsis in 57% of patients (Pseudomonas--20%, Klebsiella--20%, E. coli--8.5%, Acinetobacter--8.5%), gram-positive in 43% (coagulase-negative Staphylococci--14%, Staphylococcus epidermidis--14%, Staphylococcus aureus--9%, Streptococcus group B--3%, Listeria monocytogenes--3%). The bacteria were the most sensitive to carbapenems (85-89%), amikacin (68%), third-generation cephalosporins (47-50%), while the sensitivity to gentamicin was less than expected (48.5%). Sensitivity to ampicillin (8%) confirmed a high level of resistance to this antibiotic. All isolated Staphylococci were sensitive to vancomycin, and the overall methicillin resistance was 46%. Combined cefotaxime and amikacin therapy was the most effective of all suggested initial combinations of antibiotics (74%). The sensitivity to all other combinations of antibiotics was 51-71%. The most adequate initial combination of antibiotics for the treatment of neonatal sepsis is cefotaxime plus amikacin. The most adequate antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial neonatal sepsis is carbapenem.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial activity evaluation of some new 1-benzoyl-isothiosemicarbazides.
AB  - The synthesis of some aroylisothiosemicarbazides was accomplished and their biological activity against bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria was investigated. Different synthetic pathways were followed according to the kind of substituents that were introduced on both the aroyl ring and the sulfur atom. Anti-bacterial activity was measured against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi, while antifungal activity was evaluated against C. albicans. Two species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV and Mycobacterium avium ATCC19421, were employed to evaluate antimycobacterial activity.
TI  - Non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents decrease bacterial colonisation of contact lenses and prevent adhesion to human corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac for inhibition of bacterial colonization of contact lenses (CL) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCE). METHODS: CLs pre-colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed overnight to NSAIDs and the number of viable bacteria on the CLs were calculated. Cytotoxicity of NSAIDs to HCE cells was evaluated with the MTT assay. Viable counts were used to measure the adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE cells in the presence of the least cytotoxic NSAID. RESULTS: All NSAIDs significantly decreased bacterial colonization of CLs in a dose-dependent manner. Salicylic acid (100 mM) completely inhibited colonisation of all species tested and was the least cytotoxic. Salicylic acid also prevented adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE (60% and 58% inhibition at 60 mM at 2 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid demonstrated potential as a compound for incorporation into anti-bacterial strategies to prevent bacterial contamination of contact lenses. This study highlighted the potential for NSAIDs as anti-bacterial agents and indicates that this class of compound should be investigated for other suitable candidates.
TI  - Direct detection of bacterial pathogens in brain abscesses by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid fragments.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of detecting bacterial pathogens directly  from the clinical brain abscess specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). METHODS: A total of 14 specimens were tested by both culture and PCR amplification, targeting the full-length or a partial region of 16S rDNA. 16S rDNA is known to be conserved in bacteria. Sequencing of partial-length and full-length 16S rDNA was performed. The sequence data were compared with known sequences of 16S rDNA in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. The species with the best match of similarity were regarded as the pathogenic species in the samples. We also developed a Streptococcus-specific multiplex PCR analysis for identifying members of the Streptococcus species, the most common pathogen of brain abscesses. RESULTS: The 10 culture-positive specimens were all PCR-positive for partial 16S rDNA, but only seven were positive for full-length 16S rDNA amplification. Bacterial DNA was not detected in the remaining four specimens with a negative culture. Species identification by phenotypes from culture was in agreement with that by sequencing results of partial-length (or full-length) 16S rDNA. The Streptococcus-specific PCR analysis could detect Streptococcus species correctly in one step. CONCLUSION: Bacterial 16S rDNA sequences provide reliable clues to the identification of unknown pathogens. PCR analysis of 16S rDNA and sequencing may identify pathogens to the species level directly from brain abscesses. This approach is rapid and is useful especially in the identification of slow-growing and fastidious organisms.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - [Evaluation of 61 episodes of infective endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers  and human immunodeficiency type-1 virus infection].
AB  - We conducted a retrospective evaluation to determine the clinical and microbiological characteristics of 61 episodes of infective endocarditis (IE) in intravenous drug abusers (IDA), HIV seropositive patients. Forty-nine males and 6 females between 15 and 42 years of age were included in the study. All the included patients presented 61 episodes of IE. Fever and cardiac murmur were present in all episodes; 43 (70.4%) had hepatomegaly; 29 (47.5%) had splenomegaly. Thirty-eight (62.3%) presented cough (9 with hemoptysis); 25 (41%) had dyspnea, and 5 (8.2%) had jugular ingurgitation. Fundoscopy showed alterations in 3 patients (4.9%). Bacteriological confirmation was obtained in 41 episodes (67.2%); blood cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus in 30 cases (73.1%), Streptococcus viridans in 8 (19.5%) patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1 (2.4%), Staphylococcus hominis in 1 (2.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one case (2.4%). The tricuspid valve was involved in 51 episodes (83.6%), the aorta in 6 (9.8%), the mitral valve in 3 (4.9%) and the pulmonary valve in one (1.6%). There was evidence of right bivalvular involvement in 2 patients (3.2%) and tricuspid and mitral involvement in another (1.6%). Pericardial effusion was detected in 19 episodes (31.1%). Six patients (10.9%) died during the acute episode of IE.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Bacteriostatic properties of biomatrices against common orthopaedic pathogens.
AB  - Tissue-engineered grafts for tissue regeneration include either mature or progenitor cells seeded onto biomatrices that provide shape and support for developing tissue. Popular biomaterials used in orthopaedic surgery include collagen type I, hyaluronic acid, hydroxyapatite, and polylactic polyglycolic acid (PLGA). Biomatrices with bacteriostatic properties may be beneficial in promoting tissue-engineered graft survival in patients susceptible to infection. We evaluated the bacteriostatic effects of these biomaterials on the growth of the four most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hyaluronic acid demonstrated the largest bacteriostatic effect on these pathogens by inhibiting bacterial growth by an average of 76.8% (p = 0.0005). Hydroxyapatite and collagen inhibited growth on average by 49.7% (p = 0.011) and 37.5% (p = 0.102), respectively. PLGA exhibited the least bacteriostasis with an average inhibition of 9.8% (NS) and actually accelerated the growth of beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study of pulp capping materials.
AB  - AIM: In a comparative in vitro study we examined the bactericidal effect, adhesion and shrinkage of 5% potassium nitrate in Carboxy-Adhaesor, 5% potassium chloride in Carboxy-Adhaesor, Carboxy-Adhaesor, Adhaesor and Dycal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The bactericidal effect of the investigated pulp capping materials on the isolated microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans alpha-haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus was assessed by the diffusion method around each disk in mm. The adhesion and shrinkage were assessed after hardening of the material. RESULTS: The results obtained showed higher bactericidal activity of polycarboxylate cements in comparison to Adhaesor and Dycal. The largest zone of inhibition was found around the disks with polyacrilic acid, followed by 5% KNO3 in polyacrilic acid, 5% KCl in polyacrilic acid; significantly smaller is the zone around Dycal. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.01). The adhesion and shrinkage of polycarboxylate cements were estimated as very good, better than those of Adhaesor and Dycal. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal effect of 5% KNO3 in polycarboxylate cement is very good for the microorganisms isolated from deep caries. The adhesion to hard tissues is very good, which suggests good marginal adaptation to the cavity.
TI  - Emerging gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - Over the last several decades, a number of previously known or newly described species of gram-positive bacteria have emerged as important human pathogens, particularly in industrialized countries. These microbes have demonstrated an impressive ability to produce an array of striking infectious diseases never before seen or only infrequently encountered in the past. Despite aggressive therapeutic intervention, many of these conditions portend significant morbidity and mortality. Diseases caused by members of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera have figured prominently in this regard, with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other beta-hemolytic streptococci being regarded as the most important species. This review focuses on the clinical and microbiologic aspects of key emerging infections caused by this group of microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro bacterial adherence to ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to medical devices has been recognized as an important initial step in the infectious process, but it has not been fully elucidated regarding ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. The aim of the present study was to quantitatively determine the adherence in vitro of bacteria known to cause VP shunt infections and to identify factors affecting the process. Clinical isolates studied included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Adherence was examined quantitatively per square centimeter, visualized by electron microscopy and related to slime production and hydrophobicity. Although all four strains adhered to VP shunts, there were marked differences, with S. epidermidis and S. aureus showing the highest adherence (67.0 x 10(3) and 15.2 x 10(3) bacteria/cm(2), respectively). Factors affecting adherence included incubation time and temperature, bacterial concentration, device material (lower for silicone than Teflon), slime production and hydrophobicity. These data might be helpful for devising novel strategies to reduce VP shunt infections.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in European Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against European Gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). The MIC(90)-values of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecium 8 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. Based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/L for S. aureus and group A streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. Based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/L for vancomcyin-susceptible E. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Acute neck infections in children.
AB  - A retrospective review was conducted on 132 patients aged between two and 15 years with cervical lymphadenitis and/or with abscess formation to determine the epidemiologic and clinical presentation of these infections. The most common locations were the upper anterior cervical space (43.2%) and the submandibular space (27.3%). The duration of symptoms ranged from 12 hours to 20 days. Results of the pus cultures were available in 31 patients (23.5%). Of these, 16 cultures (51.6%) were positive. The isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (50%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (31.3%), group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (12.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.3%) and Escherichia coli (6.3%). One of the specimens yielded mixed organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Penicillin resistance was documented in six (37.5%) of the 16 gram-positive bacteria isolated from the pus culture. Both throat and blood cultures were available in all 132 patients. Seven throat cultures (5.3%) were positive for group A beta hemolytic streptococci, whereas five blood cultures (3.8%) were reported to have bacterial growth. Sixty-seven patients (50.8%) were treated with ampicillin-sulbactam, 53 patients (40.1%) with ampicillin-sulbactam and ornidazole and 12 patients (9.1%) with ceftriaxone parenterally. The mean duration of hospital stay related to the infection was 7.30 +/- 3.89 days (range, 2-28 days). The mean period for downsizing of the cervical mass by half was 4.05 +/- 2.05 days, and the recovery period (total antibiotic usage period) was 13.72 +/- 5.33 days. All of the patients had an uneventful recovery without complications. Results of both throat and blood cultures were not predictive for etiologic agents in our study group. Since ultrasonographic evaluation of each patient has limited additional benefits in clinical management, it must be reserved for selected cases to document abscess formation.
TI  - Applicability of rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the applicability of the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method (conventional method) and the rapid antibiotic susceptibility test (RAST) for susceptibility testing of bacteria in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Vitreous samples from 114 consecutive patients with endophthalmitis who were seen between June 2002 and October 2002 were subjected to microbiological processing (smears and cultures for bacteria and fungi). Forty-seven of 114 samples could be tested by RAST. In addition, the bacterial isolates from 47 patients were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the conventional method, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various antibiotics were determined. Clinical and microbiological data for these 47 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated by routine culture from 18 (38.3%) of 47 samples; all 18 were tested by the conventional method, and MICs were determined for antibiotic susceptibility. Only 10 (55.6%) of these 18 samples were analyzed by RAST. Low inoculum and the slow-growing nature of the organisms (Streptococcus, 3; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 5) accounted for no growth on RAST plates in eight cases. Of four patients who were treated with repeated intraocular antibiotics, only one received RAST result-guided intraocular injection. Considering MIC testing as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of RAST were either equal to (gentamicin, cefazolin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol) or lower than (ciprofloxacin) those of the conventional technique. CONCLUSION: This comparative study failed to demonstrate a distinct advantage of RAST as a routine procedure in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis because of the need for trained staff to perform RAST, the nearly 50% negativity of culture, and the occasionally unreliable results.
TI  - Defective neutrophil oxidative burst in preterm newborns on exposure to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The neutrophil oxidative burst is a product of the regulated assembly of the multicomponent oxidase enzyme. Our aim was to compare the oxidative burst in term (n = 10) and preterm newborns <31 wk gestational age (n = 10) after stimulation with coagulase-negative staphylococci in vitro. Strains of Streptococcus epidermidis with different invasive and slime-producing properties, one strain of S. haemolyticus, and one strain of group B-streptococcus were investigated. A whole-blood flow cytometric assay using the oxidation of hydroethidine to ethidium bromide was used. The oxidative activity in unstimulated neutrophil granulocytes [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)] was similar in term and preterm newborns, but the preterm newborns showed a significantly lower capacity to up-regulate the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation (p = 0.004). In the term but not in the preterm group, the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation correlated with the baseline oxidative burst intensity. After bacterial stimulation, there was a trend toward a greater percentage of activated neutrophils in the term group than in the preterm group, but the difference was less pronounced than that in oxidative burst intensity. Significant differences in oxidative burst response to different bacterial strains were observed (p < 0.001), but the differences could not be correlated exclusively to invasive capacity or slime-producing properties. It is concluded that the baseline oxidative activity is similar in term and preterm PMNLs but that preterm PMNLs have a decreased capacity to increase the oxidative burst in response to bacterial stimulation.
TI  - Sterility of glaucoma medications among chronic users in the community.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sterility of topical glaucoma medications among chronic  glaucoma medication users in the community. SETTING: Glaucoma service, Sanz Medical Center, Laniado Hospital, Netanya. Research mode: Cross-sectional laboratory and clinical study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chronic glaucoma patients were asked to submit their topical glaucoma preparations to the microbiology laboratory at Laniado hospital. Samples taken from the interior of the bottle and the tip were cultured using MacConkey agar, blood agar, and chocolate agar plates. RESULTS: Sixty-two bottles of topical glaucoma medications used by 27 patients were tested. Bacterial growth was detected in eight (12.9%) preparations, three of which revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Streptococcus viridans, and one Klebsiella. During the study, acute conjunctivitis was found in one patient, possibly due to the use of infected drops. In another case, two identical medications, which had been used simultaneously for more than 6 weeks by the same patient, were found to be infected. CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma topical preparations are generally found safe in terms of sterility, though bacterial growth may be found in a small percentage. In most cases, the cause of the loss of sterility could not be determined. However, in two preparations, contamination was related to the noncompliance of the patient who continued using the same preparation longer than instructed. It is imperative to increase the awareness of glaucoma patients to the fact that improper use can lead to eye-drop contamination.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of epidural catheters: microbiological examination of 502 epidural catheters used for postoperative analgesia.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of bacterial colonization of epidural catheters used for postoperative pain treatment longer than 24 hours in abdominal, thoracic, or trauma surgery patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Intermediate care facility and general ward of a university hospital. PATIENTS: 502 patients who received epidural catheters after abdominal, thoracic, or vascular surgery at our institution from January 1996 to December 2000. INTERVENTIONS: Placement of an epidural catheter, which was used for postoperative pain treatment, for more than 24 hours. The puncture site dressing included saturation each day with povidone-iodine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Microbiologic monitoring of epidural catheter tips and daily examination of puncture sites with regard to signs of inflammation took place. Four times daily patients were examined to check adequacy of pain treatment and neurologic deficits. Catheter tip cultures were positive in 29 patients (5.8%). Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 cases (76%). No case of spinal epidural abscess was observed within 6 months after epidural catheterization. The average catheterization time was 5 days (quartile range: 4 to 6 days). CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous management ensures a relatively low level of bacterial contamination in epidural catheters applied for postoperative pain treatment greater than 5 days. Contamination rarely leads to spinal epidural infection.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Bacteremia in cirrhotic patients submitted to endoscopic band ligation of esophageal varices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endoscopic procedures can develop bacteremia. Patients with chronic liver disease are more predisposed to undergo bacteremia and infections because they are immunocompromised. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of bacteremia in cirrhotics submitted to endoscopic variceal ligation. METHODS: Three groups of 40 patients each were studied. One group was made up of patients with cirrhosis who were submitted to ligation, a second group was composed of cirrhotics who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy only, and a third group was composed of patients without liver disease who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Blood was sampled from all patients for culture, both in aerobic and in anaerobic mediums, immediately before endoscopy and at 5 and 30 minutes after its completion. RESULTS: Blood culture was positive in 6 samples. In 4 of these, the bacteria (Staphylococcus hominis hominis, Staphylococcus auricularis, Acinetobacter lwoffii, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were isolated before the endoscopic procedure and thus were considered as contamination. In the ligation group, a streptococcus of the viridans group was isolated 5 minutes after the procedure, and in the cirrhosis without ligation group, a Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated at 30 minutes. None of the patients showed clinical evidence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteremia incidence in cirrhotic patients submitted to variceal ligation was 2.5%, showing no difference from the control groups.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. METHODS: Susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the E-test method. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. Aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. Experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. Three identical studies were conducted using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. After 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. The main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. RESULTS: In vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the MIC of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for P. aeruginosa. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. All serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. Experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the S. aureus model and a similar decrease in the S pneumoniae and P aeruginosa models. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. Clinical Relevance Trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
TI  - Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. CONCLUSION: Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic sensitivities: a 6-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used antimicrobial agents. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2001. Endophthalmitis categories included postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and miscellaneous (for example, keratitis). The outcome measures included intravitreal isolates identified, antibiotic sensitivities, and category of endophthalmitis. RESULTS: In all, 313 organisms were isolated from 278 patients during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 27.8% (87/313), Streptococcus viridans group in 12.8% (40/313), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 9.3% (29/313), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.7% (24/313), and Propionibacterium acnes in 7.0% (22/313). Overall, 246 of 313 (78.5%) isolates were gram-positive organisms, 37 (11.8%) were gram-negative organisms, and 27 (8.6%) were fungi. For gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 100%, gentamicin 78.4%, ciprofloxacin 68.3%, ceftazidime 63.6%, and cefazolin 66.8%. For gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were the following: ciprofloxacin 94.2%, amikacin 80.9%, ceftazidime 80.0%, and gentamicin 75.0%. Fungal isolates were Candida species (9/313), Aspergillus species (9/313), and other molds (9/313). Among the endophthalmitis categories, the most frequent organisms were the following: (1) acute-onset postoperative: S epidermidis, 46.9%; (2) delayed-onset postoperative: S epidermidis, 22.7%; (3) delayed-onset bleb-associated: fastidious gram-negative rods, 20.4%; (4) posttraumatic: S epidermidis, 20.8%; (5) endogenous: Aspergillus species, 20.8%; and (6) miscellaneous: molds (other), 36.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In considering antibiotic treatment of endophthalmitis, it is important to recognize that no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may justify the use of initial antifungal agents. Knowledge of the most frequent causative organisms in various categories will help direct appropriate initial therapy.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  - The innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  The human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hBD-2 and hBD-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. Previous studies showed that hBD-2 was induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the NF-kappaB transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. The goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hBD-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of NF-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Different bacteria induced different levels of hBD-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal- and pathogen-stimulated cells. hBD-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the JNK and p38 pathways. However, in addition, hBD-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappaB. The results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hBD-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Etiological profile of bacterial meningitis in a small hospital]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic profile of cases of meningitis treated at a small hospital in Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, and to compare it to those reported for other communities.METHODS: a retrospective study was conducted on 103 patients admitted from January 1992 to July 1996 with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The clinical criteria for diagnosis were based on patient history and physical signs and symptoms, and the laboratory criteria were based on cerebrospinal fluid examination (aspect, cytology, biochemistry, Gram staining, culture and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) and blood culture.RESULTS: The etiologic agent was identified in 81.5% of cases: Haemophilus influenzae type b in 32%, Neisseria meningitides in 25.2%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8.7%, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis in 8.7%, and others agents in 6.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the cases of bacterial meningitis treated at the Santa Lydia Hospital of Ribeirao Preto are caused by the same agents detected in other places, with Haemophilus influenzae type b being the predominant one. The study also suggests that when many people are involved in the collection of material for laboratory tests, recovery of the agent may become difficult.
TI  - HIV infected adults do not have an excess of colonising bacteria in their large airways.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV infected adults have increased susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia but the underlying immune defect is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that HIV infection might be associated with increased bacterial colonisation of distal airways by nasal flora, which would then predispose patients to bacterial pneumonia. METHODS: Healthy volunteer adults with normal chest radiographs were recruited. Bronchoscopy was carried out and uncontaminated mucosal samples were collected from proximal and distal sites in the large airways using a protected specimen brush. Samples were cultured to detect typical respiratory tract colonising organisms, and the proportion of samples found to contain colonising bacteria compared between HIV infected and uninfected subjects using non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Forty-nine subjects were studied of whom 27 were HIV infected. Colonising bacteria were identified in the nasopharynx of all subjects including Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6/49 subjects (5 HIV uninfected). Colonising bacteria were found in the distal airway of 6 subjects (3/27 HIV infected vs 3/22 HIV uninfected; chi2 = 0.07, p = 0.8). Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in the trachea of all subjects with nasal colonisation but in the distal airway of only 1 subject. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence to support a hypothesis of increased airway bacterial colonisation in healthy HIV infected subjects.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of human milk from a Brazilian milk bank].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms that indicate the hygienic and sanitary conditions of human milk samples collected at a Human Milk Bank. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty eight (338) samples of human milk collected from a milk bank in a maternity in the municipality of Goiania, in the state of Goias, Brazil were submitted to microbiological analysis. The latter were plated on McConkey agar according to the type of bacteria. Among the total number of samples collected, 194 consisted of raw milk and the remaining 144 were pasteurized milk. RESULTS: The presence of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., yeasts and molds, and Enterobacteriaceae was verified in the raw milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 10 (5.2%) samples, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 28 (14.4%) samples, Streptococcus spp. in three (1.6%) samples, yeasts and molds in 43 (22.2%) and Enterobacteriaceae in 49 (25.3%) samples. In a hundred and forty four (144) samples which underwent thermal treatment Staphylococcus aureus was detected in five (3.5%) samples, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 15 (10.4%), Staphylococcus lugdenensis in two (1.4%), Streptococcus spp. in four (2.8%), yeasts and molds in 37 (25.7%), and Enterobacteriaceae in nine (6.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis indicated a high degree of contamination in raw human milk, and as for the pasteurized milk, despite elimination of the great majority of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, the percentage of yeasts and molds was higher than in raw milk, demonstrating that a lower degree of initial contamination would be necessary for pasteurization to be an efficient means of microbiological control.
TI  - Increased killing of staphylococci and streptococci by daptomycin compared with cefazolin and vancomycin in an in vitro peritoneal dialysate model.
AB  - Peritoneal dialysate fluid (PDF) is a bacteriostatic medium that compromises the  antibacterial activity of cell wall-active agents. By use of an in vitro static model, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), and Streptococcus sanguis were exposed to daptomycin at concentrations of 10, 30, and 100 mg/liter, cefazolin at 125 mg/liter, and vancomycin at 25 mg/liter in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth or Todd Hewitt Broth (for S. sanguis) and PDF at pHs of 5.5 and 7.4. The pH had no effect on antibacterial activity. Neither cefazolin nor vancomycin produced a bactericidal or a bacteriostatic effect versus MRSA, MSSA, MSSE, or S. sanguis in PDF, while all concentrations of daptomycin were bactericidal against all organisms in PDF. Daptomycin did not exhibit concentration-dependent activity in PDF. Daptomycin appears to be a promising agent for use in peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, producing bacterial kill to a greater extent and at a higher rate than cefazolin or vancomycin in PDF.
TI  - An engineered multidomain bactericidal peptide as a model for targeted antibiotics against specific bacteria.
AB  - We constructed a peptide consisting of a staphylococcal AgrD1 pheromone fused to  the channel-forming domain of colicin Ia and named it pheromonicin. This fusion peptide had bactericidal effects against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively), but not against Staphylococcus epidermidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Growth rates, vital staining and colony forming unit (CFU) counts showed that pheromonicin did not merely suppress growth but killed S. aureus cells. The specificity of pheromonicin was shown by the absence of bactericidal effects against an accessory gene regulator (agr) locus knockout of S. aureus, and a dose-dependent inhibition of the bactericidal effects of pheromonicin by competition with corresponding free AgrD pheromone. In vivo, all pheromonicin-treated mice survived administration of MRSA that was lethal to controls. No toxicity was detectable in human liver or renal cells in culture, or in livers, kidneys or spleens of pheromonicin-treated mice. The results suggest that these types of chimeric peptides may be of value as antibiotics against specific bacterial infections.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  - Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of PEO-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. In this paper, a PEO-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. Subsequently, the presence of a PEO-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. For five bacterial (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis), adhesion to PEO-brushes was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. The initial deposition rates of Sta. epidermidis, Sta. aureus and Str. salivarius to glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while E. coli and P. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. The initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for C. albicans GB 1/2 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9, respectively. Coating of the glass surface with a PEO-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic P. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. For both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic C. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic C. albicans. The PEO-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. Assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the Lifshitz-Van der Waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. Decreased Lifshitz-van der Waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.
TI  - [Vitrectomy for endophthalmitis after cataract surgery].
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify risk factors of poor visual outcome with vitrectomy for early-onset endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical records of 29 consecutive eyes with endophthalmitis developing within 6 weeks after cataract surgery and that underwent therapeutic vitrectomy between June 1996 and April 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-two of the eyes received intravitreal injections of vancomycin and ceftazidime at the time of vitrectomy, and all patients received intravenous antibiotics. Eyes were divided into two groups; group A consisted of 22 eyes with a final visual acuity of 0.2 or greater, and group B consisted of 7 eyes with a final visual acuity of less than 0.2. RESULTS: Fifteen eyes (52%) in group A achieved a visual acuity of 0.5 or better and 8(28%) achieved a visual acuity of 1.0, while 4 eyes in group B developed phthisis bulbi. For eyes with a preoperative visual acuity of hand motions or worse, there was no correlation between final visual acuity and preoperative visual acuity. The overall culture-positive rate was 57%. In group A, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in 6 eyes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 3 eyes and enterococcus in 2 eyes. In group B, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (AHS) was identified in 4 eyes, aspergillus in 1 eye, and MRSA in 1 eye. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin with the exception of the aspergillus. AHS infection appeared to be associated with wound failure from the initial cataract surgery and a poor visual outcome. Among 3 of the eyes that developed phthisis bulbi, intravitreal injection of antibiotics was not performed. CONCLUSION: Early vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of vancomycin may improve visual outcomes, but infection with AHS may be associated with cataract surgery wound failure and poor visual outcomes.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms presents a critical problem for patients undergoing surgery. Acidic pH, which is produced by oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), is a broad-spectrum physiological detriment to survival of microorganisms known to cause surgical infections. The purpose of this study was to examine the antimicrobial effect of ORC against antibiotic-resistant organisms. METHODS: ORC products were challenged with ATCC reference strains and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and non-resistant ATCC strains of S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Samples of three ORC products (SURGICEL absorbable hemostat, SURGICEL Fibrillar absorbable hemostat, and SURGICEL NU-KNIT absorbable hemostat and identified, respectively, as ORC-R, ORC-F, and ORC-N for this study) were inoculated with challenge organisms in nutrient broth to produce a weight to volume ratio of 15 mg ORC/mL. Plate counts were performed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was seen with all three ORC products against the challenge organisms. Data indicate that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms remain susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of ORC. In testing with nine of 10 bacteria, including four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (VRE, MRSA, and PRSP) three-log or greater reductions were seen at 24-h exposure. One ATCC strain of VRE demonstrated some level of resistance to the acidic pH effect. ORC-N showed a three-log reduction with this organism, whereas the reductions with ORC-R and ORC-F were less than one log. CONCLUSION: Since low pH affects a relatively broad-spectrum of bacteria and does not act in a mechanism-specific manner, as do antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are unlikely to resist the ORC pH effect. Results of this in vitro assessment support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial activity of ORC is effective against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Six cases of bacterial infection in porous orbital implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. CASES: Five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. The hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. Thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary Medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. OBSERVATIONS: The culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas Streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the Medpor implant patient. Culture for the remaining patient was negative . CONCLUSIONS: If there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. Systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. If no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.
TI  - Severe infective keratitis leading to hospital admission in New Zealand.
AB  - AIM: To identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in New Zealand. METHODS: Over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to Auckland Hospital were identified. The clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (SD 15.5) days. The majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). Corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. Bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being Gram positive organisms (72%). The most common isolates identified were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (16%), Propionibacterium acnes (14%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). In addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in 4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. Importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. Antimicrobial treatment was changed on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). Median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logMAR 0.86) (IQR 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logMAR 0.360) (IQR 0.15-1.70), respectively. Previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer visual acuity. The mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (IQR 2.0-8.0) days. Longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. A significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. Previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. Many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.
TI  - Echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of Valsalva in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. We sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. METHODS: We reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from May 1994 to January 2002. The patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. RESULTS: Of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. Of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. The remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. There were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. We identified rupture of a sinus of Valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two, and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. The mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of Valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a Blalock-Taussig shunt in one patient each. Organisms isolated included Streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, Streptococcus sanguis in 1, Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and Enteroccocus in 2. Cultures proved negative in 7 patients. Surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). Only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. Both patients infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of Valsalva. CONCLUSION: Involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of Valsalva, in which case infection with Streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.
TI  - [Microflora of the nasal mucosa in allergic perennial and infectious rhinitis].
AB  - The microbiological study of 69 patients with allergic annual rhinitis (AAR) and  infectious rhinitis (IR) was carried out. In AAR the isolated representatives of 15 genera and 40 species were distributed in 2 to 7 component; in IR the isolated representatives of 16 genera and 25 species were grouped in 2 to 4-component associations. In AAR Staphylococcus aureus was found to belong to the main species and in IR, S. aureus and S. epidermidis, while the number of species regarded as occasional in AAR was 7 (S. auricularis, S. cohnii, S. hominis, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. apitis, S. schleiferi). Differences in the distribution of Neisseria, nonfermenting Gram negative bacteria, Streptococcus in associations in cases of AAR and IR were established. In AAR Corynebacterium pseudodiphthericum and in IR C. pseudotuberculosis were the dominant species.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - [Surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (HAI) or community acquired infection (CAI) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: According to the previous protocol, from July 1(st) 2000 to June 30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals. Among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of the bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: The detectable rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. Among a total of 238 strains of S. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with CAI and 37 were from HAI patients, the rate of MRSA from HAI patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of MRSA from CAI patients (30.2%, 42/139) (P < 0.01). The total resistant rate of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was 26.7% (8/30), including a R% of 3.3% (1/30) and an I% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of Enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. The ratio of number of strains of E. faecalis to E. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). The rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREF) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). Neither strains of S. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus were found resistant to vancomycin. No strains of Enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. All strains of Enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The resistance patterns of Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, PRSP, and AREF are similar to the results of the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. No strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including VRSA and VISA or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE is found in this study.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Linezolid resistance since 2001: SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. Linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. Linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. METHODS: During 2001-2002, 8 resistant strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating SENTRY institutions in the US were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus oralis. Resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated MICs (> or =8 microg/mL) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone AZD2563. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. All enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (S. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. E. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002. Resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. Clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. Longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.
TI  - Glycopeptide carboxamides active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Glycopeptide antibiotics were synthesized via the PyBOP mediated condensation of  aliphatic, heterocyclic and aromatic amines with the C-terminus of vancomycin, LY264826 (A82846B) and semi-synthetic derivatives of these natural products. Amides of LY264826 and vancomycin demonstrated excellent activity against staphylococci and streptococci as compared to the parent natural product. However, the amides of N-alkylated LY264826 and N-alkylated vancomycin were active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci as well as other gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - [Some features of tonsillar microflora and microbial interaction (in normal and pathological states)].
AB  - The description of a new method for the determination of interaction between bacterial strains isolated from the mucous membrane of tonsils of healthy children and patients with chronic tonsillitis. In the analysis of mutual influence of symbionts on the hemolytic, lecitovitellase, lysozyme and antilysozyme activity of microbes isolated from healthy children no changes in the expression of these pathogenicity and persistence factors have been detected in the overwhelming majority of cases (70.8-89.9%). In the microflora of sick children interactions were synergic with respect to pathogenicity factors in 35.2-46.7% of cases and antagonistic in 18.7-31.3% of cases.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Central line sepsis.
AB  - Since 1980, the placement of central venous access devices has become routine, and these catheters have been of great benefit in the treatment of patients with cancer. Unfortunately, central venous catheters have not been without complications. Central line sepsis has been reported to be one of the most frequently occurring complications, and although it is extremely costly to treat, more importantly, this condition is potentially life threatening to patients. Developing strategies that would prevent central line catheter infections has been a continual challenge for healthcare providers. Studies have been conducted on the use of catheters with antiseptic coatings, antimicrobial coatings, impregnated antimicrobial cuffs, prophylactic antibiotic therapy, antibiotic locks, use of antithrombolytics, different exit site dressings, and the use of various disinfectants for cleansing catheter exit sites. Healthcare providers, including oncology nurses, need to be knowledgeable concerning potential sources of infection and factors that may lead to central line sepsis (Chaiyakunapruk, Veenstra, Lipsky, & Saint, 2002; Darouiche et al., 1999; Little & Palmer, 1998; Veenstra, Saint, Saha, Lumley, & Sullivan, 1999). They need to advocate for the use of sterile technique during catheter insertion and aseptic technique when routine maintenance is provided and be aware of the standard treatments for and potential outcomes of central line catheter infections. In addition, oncology nurses should be encouraged to support and participate in controlled, randomized studies that may provide scientific-based practices that decrease the number of catheter-related infections in the future.
TI  - Infectious keratitis after photorefractive keratectomy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To elucidate risk factors, microbial culture results, and visual outcomes for infectious keratitis after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective chart review, case report, and literature review. METHODS: The records of 12 patients with infectious keratitis after PRK were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Causative organism, response to medical treatment, and visual outcome. RESULTS: Infectious keratitis developed in 13 eyes of 12 patients after PRK. Organisms cultured were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), including a bilateral case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4); Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3); and Streptococcus viridans (n = 1). Four patients manipulated their contact lenses, and 2 patients were exposed to nosocomial organisms while working in a hospital environment. Prophylactic antibiotics used were tobramycin (nine cases), polymyxin B-trimethoprim (three cases), and ciprofloxacin (one case). Final best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/100. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious corneal ulceration is a serious potential complication of PRK. Gram-positive organisms are the most common pathogens. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be broad spectrum and should include gram-positive coverage.
TI  - Topical anaesthesia: a risk factor for post-cataract-extraction endophthalmitis?
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate if the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis in temporal clear corneal cataract surgery is influenced by the use of topical anaesthesia compared to retrobulbar anaesthesia. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of one surgeon's cataract surgery between October 1997 and October 2001. RESULTS: Between October 1997 and May 2000, there were 633 cataract extractions performed with 219 patients operated under topical anaesthesia and 414 under retro-bulbar injection. The selection criteria were that surgically easier cases underwent topical anaesthesia. There were five patients who suffered postoperative endophthalmitis in their first week, of which four cases were under topical anaesthesia. This was shown to be borderline significance of P = 0.05 using the Fischer exact 2-tailed test. There was a complicated case, operated under retrobulbar anaesthesia, who had a low-grade endophthalmitis in the second postoperative week. The four topical cases and the case from the second week all grew Staphylococcus epidermidis. The retrobulbar case developing endophthalmitis in the first week grew alpha haemolytic Streptococcus. After May 2000, there was a change to performing all cataract surgery under retrobulbar anaesthesia and the next 453 cases had no incidence of endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Topical anaesthesia techniques in temporal clear corneal cataract extraction may be a factor in endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of S-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of S-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. The MICs of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. The anti-MRSA activity of S-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). In time-kill studies with 10 strains each of MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, S-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the MIC after 24 h of exposure, indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. Furthermore, in population analysis of MRSA strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the MIC of S-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of S-3578-resistant strains from MRSA. S-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), with a MIC(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. S-3578 also had antibacterial activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. In conclusion, S-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and PRSP. Thus, S-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.
TI  - [Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 3-hydroxy-6-O-methylerythromycin-9-O-substituted oxime derivatives].
AB  - AIM: To study the antibacterial activity against erythromycin-resistant organisms of 3-hydroxy-6-O-methylerythromycin-9-O-substituted oxime derivatives, a new route of synthesis with 6 steps was designed. METHODS: The starting material, erythromycin A (1), was reacted with NH2OH.HCI to give 2, which reacted with BzBr to give 3. Selective methylation of C-6 hydroxy group using iodomethane afforded 4, which was hydrolyzed with loss of the 3-cladinosyl to give 5. Compound 5 was reduced by H2 to provide 6, which was treated with substituted benzyl chlorides to provide 7 and 8. RESULTS: Four unreported compounds (5-8) were synthesized. The antibacterial activity of the new compounds were tested in vitro against both erythromycin-susceptible and erythromycin-resistant organisms. The compounds 5 (MIC = 1 microgram.mL-1) and 6 (MIC = 1 microgram.mL-1) showed significant activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis 26,069 compared with erythromycin (MIC = 4 micrograms.mL-1). Compounds 5 (MIC = 16, 4 micrograms.mL-1), 7 (MIC = 32, 64 micrograms.mL-1) and 8 (MIC = 64, 32 micrograms.mL-1) showed better activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae 64 and Staphylococcus aureus 9525 than erythromycin (MIC > 128, 128 micrograms.mL-1). CONCLUSION: 3-hydroxy-6-O-methylerythromycin-9-O-substituted oxime derivatives have stronger antibacterial activity against some erythromycin-resistant organisms than erythromycin A.
TI  - [Pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
AB  - We contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. The results were that the Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was 43.8% and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) was 56.2% in Group A (1985-1990); GPC was 24.6% and GNB was 75.4% in Group B (1995-2000). The predominant bacteria were in the following order: Preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in Group A; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in Group B. The results suggest that GNB is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
TI  - Subcutaneous drainage versus no drainage after minilaparotomy in gynecologic benign conditions: a randomized study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of subcutaneous drainage in patients who are affected by benign gynecologic diseases that are treated by a Kustner's minilaparotomy incision. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a randomized controlled study with 72 patients who underwent operation for benign gynecologic disease. Patients were assigned intraoperatively to two groups: group A (36 patients) had a closed drainage system and group B (36 patients) had no drainage. Historic data, clinical and surgical characteristics, and perioperative complications were recorded prospectively. Postoperative care data, surgical incision complications, and hospital stay were analyzed. Patients were to be seen 4 weeks after the operation to assess wound healing. RESULTS: No patients had intraoperative complications or blood transfusions. A significant difference was observed between the drainage versus no-drainage groups regarding postoperative complications and hospital stay (P =.001, both groups). No patients had surgical complications at 4 weeks after the last operation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that routine prophylactic subcutaneous drainage is indicated in patients who undergo Kustner's minilaparotomy incision for benign gynecologic operation. Drains significantly prevent wound complications and reduce hospital stay.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in vitro activities against 4,003 clinical bacterial isolates collected in 24 Italian laboratories.
AB  - Levofloxacin showed comparable in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus, while greater susceptibility was observed in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus epidermidis, mainly when oxacillin resistant. The susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to levofloxacin reached 99%.
TI  - [The disinfection efficiency comparison of different treatments on dental impression and gypsum casts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, the disinfecting efficiency of five disinfecting methods to three bacterial: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis and Bacillus subtilis were evaluated. METHODS: Germ free impressions and gypsum casts were divided into three teams contained 16 impressions and 5 gypsum casts for each one. Each team was smeared with each one of the three bacterial solutions. Then four disinfecting methods were administrated on these impressions separately, 2% glutaraldehyde immersion, 2% glutaraldehyde spray, 5% Eric immersion, 5% Eric spray. And ozone treatment was administrated on gypsum casts. Control teams were set up. After the treatment the impressions and gypsum casts were sampled at standard sites. The colonies were counted after culture and were used to deduce the germicidal ratio as the standard of disinfecting efficiency. RESULTS: There was no difference between the efficiencies of five disinfecting methods for Streptococcus sanguis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. But for B. subtilis, the immersion methods have the highest efficiency among the methods and the ozone treatment has the least efficiency. CONCLUSION: 2% glutaraldehyde immersion, spray, 5% Eric immersion, spray are all effective disinfecting methods for impressions and ozone treatment is an effective method in disinfecting the gypsum casts.
TI  - Keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  - Human beta defensin 2 (hbetaD-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. We hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2, measured by reverse transcription-PCR, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetaD-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. Expression of hbetaD-2 was induced consistently by S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of S. pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetaD-2. No correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2. S. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetaD-2 than S. epidermidis. We conclude that the ability to induce hbetaD-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetaD-2 expression by S. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. Induction of expression of hbetaD-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable S. epidermidis to survive on the skin surface and modulate hbetaD-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.
TI  - Subdural Empyema.
AB  - Subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. The empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. Intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. Spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. The most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in particular those of the Streptococcus milleri group (S. milleri and Streptococcus anginosus). Staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides, may be present. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and Salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced AIDS; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. Spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by S. aureus. Subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical and neurosurgical emergency. The diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial and spinal subdural empyema is MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by MRI. Conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by CT myelography where MRI is negative. Treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. Pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. Because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against S. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and Gram-negative organisms. Antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. Provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against S. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. Morbidity and mortality in intracranial and spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. Both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.
TI  - Ultrasonic enhancement of antibiotic action on several species of bacteria.
AB  - The effect of the antibiotics gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline,  and ampicillin on planktonic cultures of Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella derby, Streptococcus mitis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with and without an application of 70 kHz ultrasound was studied. The ultrasound was applied at levels that had no inhibitory effect on planktonic cultures of bacteria. Measurements of viability at, above, and below the minimum inhibitory concentration of the above antibiotics on the planktonic cultures of these bacteria showed that a simultaneous application of 70 kHz ultrasound and antibiotic significantly increased the effectiveness of selected antibiotics. Bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when harmless levels of ultrasound were combined with some antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides. Similar synergistic effects of combined ultrasound and antibiotic treatment were seen in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with several classes of antibiotics. These results may have application in the treatment of bacterial infections normally resistant to some antibiotics.
TI  - Development of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bacterial identification in diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial PCR in infective endocarditis (IE) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. METHODS: Thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with IE (diagnosed according to Duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. Two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. DNA was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for 16S rRNA were tested, to determine the most specific pair. Amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under UV light. RESULTS: Positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with IE. A typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. The highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (F/R) primers, as the relevant amplified PCR product was present in all blood samples with IE, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. CONCLUSION: Broad-range PCR in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific PCR. However, under controlled conditions, broad-range PCR may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Replacing the ascending aorta and aortic valve for acute prosthetic valve endocarditis: is using prosthetic material contraindicated?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of prosthetic material (rather than a homograft) for ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (Bentall procedure) in cases of acute prosthetic valve endocarditis is controversial. We report favorable results using this technique almost exclusively (a homograft was used in only 3 patients with hematological problems) during a 12-year interval. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (55 +/- 14 years; 22 male) underwent a Bentall procedure for acute prosthetic valve endocarditis between 1988 and 2000. Twenty-five patients had undergone previous aortic valve replacement (1 with concomitant mitral valve replacement, 4 with coronary artery bypass grafting), and 3 had had a previous Bentall operation. The median interval between initial surgery and reoperation was 13 months (range, 1 to 106). Sixty-eight percent of operations were urgent or emergencies. Ninety-three percent of patients had significant aortic regurgitation; complete annuloaortic dehiscence occurred in 71%, and in 57%, an abscess was found. Causative organisms were identified in 25 of 28 patients: Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Streptococcus viridans (6), Pseudomonas (2), and Legionella (1). RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had mechanical and 5 had biological valves implanted during the Bentall procedure. Hypothermic circulatory arrest was used in 64%. Hospital mortality was 11%: there was one intraoperative death, and two before discharge (one cardiac, one sepsis). Eighty-nine percent survived without stroke. During follow-up (median, 44.5 months; complete in 92%), 1 patient died of recurrent endocarditis at 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that prosthetic root replacement may be superior to use of a homograft for acute aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis, with only a 4% incidence of recurrent endocarditis and reoperation.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  - [Bacterial examination of sinusitis using antral puncture and irrigation].
AB  - Aerobic bacterial examination for sinusitis was conducted using specimens from maxillary sinuses collected by antral puncture in 540 patients--284 men and 256 women aged 6-89 years--between May 1999 and April 2000. We obtained 528 strains of bacteria. Our results were as follows: 1. We obtained 303 pathogens from 540 patients. In acute sinusitis, the most frequently found was Streptococcus pneumoniae (30.4%), followed by Hemophilus influenzae (27.7%). In chronic cases, the most frequently found was Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.0%), followed by Hemophilus influenzae (15.1%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%). 2. We found an increase in bacteria resistant to multiple drugs, with 11.1% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates methicillin-resistant in acute sinusitis and 40% methicillin-resistant in chronic sinusitis, and that 30.6% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant. 3. Ciclacillin was effective against 64.7% of all pathogens isolated in this study, cefpodoxime proxetil effective against 6.5%, and cefixime effective against 2.4%. 4. In considering pathogens, we therefore choose antibiotics and make a maxillary aspiration puncture.
TI  - Monocytes maintain tissue factor activity after cytolysis of bacteria-infected endothelial cells in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Intravascular infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Streptococcus sanguis can initiate fibrin formation on endocardial tissue, causing bacterial endocarditis. The ability of these bacteria to injure intact endothelial cells (ECs) and to aggravate tissue factor (TF)-dependent coagulation in the presence of blood leukocytes was investigated. Cytolysis of ECs occurred after infection with S. aureus and, with membrane-bound monocytes or granulocytes present, also after infection with S. sanguis or S. epidermidis. Monocytes that subsequently bound to the resultant bacteria-infected subcellular EC matrix (ECM) elicited TF mRNA, TF antigen, and TF activity (TFA). This was most pronounced in ECM prepared after the cytolysis of ECs by infection with S. aureus or S. epidermidis. We demonstrate that monocytes continue and intensify fibrin formation after lysis of bacteria-infected ECs, which suggests that, during the course of intravascular infection, early fibrin formation shifts from being mediated by EC-derived TFA to being mediated by TFA of monocytes bound to bacteria-infected ECM.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Discovery of a novel and potent class of FabI-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  - Bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (FabI) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. High-throughput screening of the Staphylococcus aureus FabI enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Iterative medicinal chemistry and X-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(E)-N-methyl-N-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the FabI inhibition assay. Compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an S. aureus infection model in rats. Biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of FabI. Compound 4 also exhibits weak FabK inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, which depend on FabK and both FabK and FabI, respectively, for their enoyl-ACP reductase function. These results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for the treatment of S. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Successful treatment of orthodontic-associated traumatic endophthalmitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report successful management of orthodontic-associated traumatic endophthalmitis. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: A 17-year-old boy developed endophthalmitis after a penetrating corneal injury produced during removal of an orthodontic wire. Treatment included pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with broad-spectrum intravitreal and systemic antibiotics. RESULTS: Clinical endophthalmitis resolved after PPV with injection of intravitreal vancomycin (1 mg) and ceftazidime (2.25 mg), along with oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily). Microbiologic cultures of intraocular samples produced Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, and Lactobacillus species. Visual acuity improved to 20/20. CONCLUSIONS: Orthodontic-associated endophthalmitis can involve multiple organisms. It can be successfully treated with current treatment modalities, including PPV, intravitreal antibiotics, and systemic antibiotics.
TI  - [Microbiologic analysis of results from blood cultures].
AB  - The aim of our investigations was the microbiological analysis together with the  evaluation of sensitivity of bacteria frequently isolated from blood cultures. Blood samples were taken from patients with symptoms suggesting bacteremia in Rydygier's Hospital in Cracow. A total of 11,170 blood samples taken from 1997 to 2000 were tested. Automatic VITAL system (bioMerieux) was applied to culture and detect microorganisms. Bacteria were identified by ATB system (bioMerieux). Susceptibility was detected by ATB and disc diffusion method. Percentage of positive results relating to detection of microorganisms of clinical significance was 16.9% (1891 cultures). Staphylococcus spp. (Staph. epidermidis in range 22.8% to 21.9%), Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were most frequently isolated species among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. In 2000, compared to 1997 the number of isolates of MRSA increased considerably (from 1.8% to 6.8%). In blood infections the increase of frequency of E. coli bacteria was also noted: 6.1% and 11.4% in 1997 and 2000, respectively. Among non-fermentant bacilli the percentage of occurrence of P. aeruginosa in the period of 4 years was comparable in the range 7.3% in 1997 to 7.2% in 2000. The increase in the frequency of blood infections of A. baumanii was also noticed (respectively from 4.8% to 9.9%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa strains to selected beta-lactame antibiotics and aminoglycosydes increased in 2000 in comparison to 1999. A. baumanii strains were 100% sensitive only to imipenem.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DW286, a new fluoronaphthyridone antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of DW286, a novel fluoronaphthyridone with potent antibacterial activity, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, gemifloxacin, sparfloxacin, and trovafloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis, the in vitro activity of DW286 was stronger than that of any other reference antibiotic. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of DW286 was similar to those of trovafloxacin and gemifloxacin but was weaker than that of ciprofloxacin. In a mouse systemic infection caused by three S. aureus strains, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus and quinolone-resistant S. aureus (QRSA), DW286 demonstrated the most potent activity, as found in vitro. Specially, DW286 is >or=8-fold more active against QRSA than the other fluoroquinolones. And the 50% protective doses for DW286 were correspondent with the in vitro activities.
TI  - Epidemiology of neonatal meningitis in Qatar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonatal meningitis is responsible for thousands of neonatal deaths annually all over the world. Our study was conducted to determine the epidemiology, management and best preventive measures for neonatal meningitis in Qatar. METHODS: A retrospective study reviewed the records of bacterial meningitis patients under the age of one month. The study was carried out at Hamad Medical Hospital, the only hospital that provides health care at Qatar and the study period was between January 1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Sixty percent of patients had early onset meningitis. Causative organisms were group B Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas species, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Flavibacterium meningococcus septicum. A bacterial resistance to the usual combination of ampicillin and gentamicin were noticed (as initial treatment before culture sensitivity results), which affected negatively on some patients. Complications of cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy occurred in 3 patients (23%). None of the patients died during the study period. CONCLUSION: Emphasis is placed on the importance of correct early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy. It is suggested that the identification and appropriate treatment of any maternal bacterial infection is an important measure in preventing neonatal sepsis and meningitis.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Microbiological quality and somatic cell count of ewe milk with special reference to staphylococci.
AB  - A total 1502 useful half udders of 762 Churra ewes from eight herds were aseptically sampled in midlactation to study both the bacteriological isolates and the SCC of milk. Corynebacteria, enterococci, micrococci, staphylococci, and streptococci represented 11.2, 2.9, 1.4, 78.9, and 3.1% of all isolates, respectively. Within staphylococci, novobiocin-sensitive species (71.1%) were much more frequently isolated than novobiocin-resistant ones (7.8%). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species (53.2% of the isolates). Log SCC of uninfected half udder milk was 4.86. Isolates of novobiocin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, and corynebacteria were associated to low values of log SCC (4.85 to 5.20). In contrast, infection by novobiocin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci organisms was related to a sharp inflammatory response with log SCC means between 5.92 and 6.32. The species that showed the highest log SCC were Pasteurella haemolytica (7.62), Streptococcus agalactiae (7.28), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.68). High prevalence of infections by novobiocin-sensitive staphylococci together with high SCC related to such infections show a relevant role of these organisms in ewe mastitis. Consequently, implementation of staphylococcal mastitis control programs would be of great interest in dairy ewe herds to improve microbiological and hygienic quality of milk.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a new series of 1,4-naphthoquinones.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of 1,4-naphthoquinones was demonstrated. Disk diffusion tests were carried out against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The compound 5-amino-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was the most effective, presenting inhibition zones measuring 20 mm against staphylococci, streptococci and bacilli at 50 microg/ml. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and several clinical isolates of this bacterium were also inhibited. Naphthazarin, 5-acetamido-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 2,3-diamino-1,4-naphthoquinone were the next most active compounds. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the active compounds was determined against S. aureus, ranging from 30 to 125 microg/ml. All compounds presented a minimal bactericidal concentration higher than 500 microg/ml, indicating that their effect was bacteriostatic. The EC50, defined as the drug concentration that produces 50% of maximal effect, was 8 microg/ml for 5-amino-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone against S. aureus, S. intermedius, and S. epidermidis. These results indicate an effective in vitro activity of 5-amino-8-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and encourage further studies for its application in antibiotic therapy.

TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to titanium-oxy-nitride (TiNOX) coatings with different resistivities: a novel approach for the development of biomaterials.
AB  - In this study the quantitative adhesion of a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to and the ease of removal from different TiNOX coatings was investigated by means of a parallel plate flow chamber and in situ image analysis. Quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an air-liquid interface. S. epidermidis and S. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) microohms cm. P. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. These results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for TiNOX coatings with a specific resistivity. TiNOX coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of S. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. However, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated TiNOX remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) microohms cm. This indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the TiNOX coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.
TI  - Novel agents for resistant Gram-positive infections--a review.
AB  - Gram-positive infections have increased in recent years, particularly those that  are of nosocomial origin, leading to a broad use of agents with activity against these pathogens. Concomitantly, antimicrobial resistance of these pathogens also became widespread. Among the most common Gram-positive resistant pathogens are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, resistant to penicillin and macrolides, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediately-resistant S. aureus (GISA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The response of the pharmaceutical industry to this challenge was the development of new antibiotics active against these pathogens. Among these antibiotics, this review will focus on: linezolid, an oxazolidinone; GAR-936, a tetracycline derivative; daptomycin, a lipopeptide; and ortivancin (LY-333328), a glycopeptide related to vancomycin. Except for linezolid, which has been recently launched in many countries, all other agents referred to in this review are still at various developmental stages. It is hoped that in the near future most of these agents will be approved and thus the grim outlook of patients infected with resistant Gram-positive bacteria may improve.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis. Epidemiological study of the Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcomes of vertically transmitted and nosocomial meningitis in neonates over a two-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases of neonatal meningitis diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 in the neonatology departments of 28 acute-care hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo") were prospectively studied. Bacteriological meningitis was considered confirmed when cerebrospinal fluid culture (CSF) was positive for bacteria, virus or fungi, probable when CSF culture was negative but blood culture was positive, and unconfirmed when both cultures were negative. RESULTS: During the study period, 151 cases of meningitis were diagnosed. Transmission was vertical in 84 cases and nosocomial in 67. The incidence of vertically transmitted meningitis was 0.51 of live births, and was significantly higher in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 66 patients (78.6 %). No risk factors were identified in 46.4 % of the patients. Group B Streptococcus (agalactiae) was isolated in 48.5 % of cases of confirmed meningitis and Escherichia coli was isolated in 18.2 %. In 69.7 % of cases the results of blood culture were in agreement with those of CSF culture. The overall mortality rate was 8.3 %; mortality was significantly higher in VLBW infants (33.3 % vs 4.2 % in infants weighing 1,500 g). Thirteen percent of survivors had sequelae. The incidence of meningitis of nosocomial transmission was 0.2 % of admissions and was more frequent in VLBW infants. Confirmed bacteriological meningitis was diagnosed in 49 patients (73.1 %). Two or more risk factors were present in 62.7 % of patients. E. coli was isolated in 26.5 % of cases of nosocomial meningitis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 24.5 %. In 55 % of patients the results of blood culture agreed with those of CSF culture. The overall mortality rate was 19.4 %. Mortality was significantly higher in VLBW infants and 18.5 % of survivors showed sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, mortality and sequelae of neonatal meningitis in Spain were similar to those reported in recent studies. The most commonly isolated pathogens were group B Streptococcus in vertically transmitted meningitis and E. coli and S. epidermidis in nosocomial meningitis. We believe the distinction between vertical and nosocomial meningitis to be appropriate because the epidemiology of these diseases is different, which implies a different therapeutic approach. The high percentage of positive blood cultures indicates the need to include lumbar puncture whenever systemic infection is suspected in the neonatal period.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution in patients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  - This study evaluated the potential for bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution after 3 days of clinical use in patients. Twenty patients with upper respiratory infection used the saline as a spray, and 20 patients used the solution as drops. Bacterial growth was present in 18 (907%) solution containers of the spray group and in 3 (157%) solution containers of the drops group (P <.005). Twenty isolates were recovered from the spray group and 3 from the drops group. The predominate isolates included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha Streptococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus spp. This study demonstrates the contamination of nasal saline-dispensing solution used as a spray with micro-organisms that are part of the normal skin and nasal flora and gram-negative organisms of potential enteric origin. These data support the use of nasal saline-dispensing solution as drops, rather than as spray. They also illustrate the risk for crossinfection if a nasal solution is used by more than 1 patient.
TI  - Determining Linezolid's baseline in vitro activity in Canada using gram-positive  clinical isolates collected prior to its national release.
AB  - All of the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 317), Enterococcus species (n = 315), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 282), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 176) collected at 16 Canadian microbiology laboratories from October 2000 to April 2001 were susceptible to linezolid. Future studies will determine how linezolid clinical use in Canada affects its in vitro activity.
TI  - [Frequency and etiology of seminal infections in the study of infertile couples].
AB  - Male genital infections are a relevant cause in the etiology of infertility, due  to abnormalities in sperm quality, affecting spermatozoal count and motility. OBJECTIVE: Identify the most common bacteria isolated from seminal cultures and their impact on seminal quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal and observational study was performed by reviewing 295 files of infertile males seen in our clinic of Reproductive Biology at the Hospital Juarez de Mexico, in whom seminogram and seminal cultures were practiced for detection of seminal infection and quality assessment. RESULTS: 47% of cases presented infection by one or two bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus (alpha and beta hemolitic) and Escherichia coli prevailed. The main alterations in quality were motility, pH, morphology and viscosity in association with S. epidermidis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of our group of study disclosed seminal infections and it resembled the percentages reported in the literature; most of them were asymptomatic. In disparity with other reports the most common bacterial agent found in association with changes in seminal quality was a skin saprophyte.
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cAM373 activity in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The sex pheromone cAM373 of Enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cAM373 of Staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the C-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. The deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. The chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated camE (encoding cAM373) and camS (encoding staph-cAM373). Truncated and full-length clones of camE were generated in Escherichia coli, in which cAM373 activity was expressed. In E. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of camE had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. Establishment of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cAM373 activity to 3% of normal levels. The camS determinant has homologues in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cAM373 closely. The particular significance of staph-cAM373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.
TI  - Fiberoptic intraparenchymal brain pressure monitoring with the Camino V420 monitor: reflections on our experience in 163 severely head-injured patients.
AB  - To assess the safety and accuracy of the Camino intraparenchymal sensor, we prospectively evaluated hemorrhagic complications, zero-drift, infection, and system malfunction in 163 patients monitored after a severe head injury. Mean duration of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring was 5 +/- 2.2 days (range: 12 h to 11 days). Of the 141 patients with a control CT scan, four showed a 1-2-cc collection of blood at the catheter's end. When removed, the sensors underread the true ICP value (negative zero-drift) in 80 of the 126 sensors evaluated (63.5%). Fourteen sensors showed no zero-drift, and 32 sensors overread the true ICP value (positive zero-drift) (median: -1 mm Hg; interquartile range: -4 to +1 mm Hg). No significant relationship was found between zero-drift, the surgeon who implanted the sensor, intracranial hypertension, or duration of ICP monitoring. No clinical infections could be attributed to the devices. Sixteen patients (9.8%) required more than one ICP sensor due to malfunctioning of the system. In conclusion, continuous ICP monitoring using the Camino intraparenchymal sensor has a low complication rate. However, this sensor may underread the real ICP values in a high number of patients. The lack of correlation between duration of ICP monitoring and zero-drift suggests that, contrary to the recommendations of other reports, the intraparenchymatous Camino sensor can provide reliable readings after the fifth day of use.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Skin and soft tissue infection.
AB  - Abstract. Normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. The most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). Skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes. This article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. Impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by S. aureus and / or Group A streptoccus. In mild and localized impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin should be used. Folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by S. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. These conditions can be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by S. aureus of phase group II. Intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. Erysipelas and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or S. aureus requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. Gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Septic arthritis in postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
AB  - A review of postoperative infected anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions was done on 3500 consecutive arthroscopic procedures. The purpose was to assess incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome factors. Six postoperative intraarticular infections were detected. Average followup was 3 years (range, 2-8 years). The rate of infection was 0.14%. Five men and one woman with a median age of 32.5 years (range, 20-51 years) comprised the study group. The average interval from the onset of symptoms to the initial arthroscopic intervention was 7.5 days (range, 2-20 days). Staphylococcus aureus was present in three knees, Staphylococcus epidermidis in two, and Streptococcus nonhemolytic in one. All patients had initial arthroscopic debridement and lavage followed by 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Two grafts were removed: one patient had delayed ligament reconstruction and the other had total knee arthroplasty. The remaining patients had full range of motion. In the group with the best result, two patients had Staphylococcus epidermidis and one had Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated 2 days after clinical symptoms began. The other two patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus had unsatisfactory results. Anterior cruciate ligament infection is rare, but diagnosable. When treated early with appropriate antibiotic therapy and arthroscopic debridement, four of six grafts were retained. If the infection does not respond rapidly to early therapy, then graft removal is an option.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - The superoxide dismutase gene sodM is unique to Staphylococcus aureus: absence of sodM in coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase (SOD) profiles of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were determined by using whole-cell lysates and activity gels. All S. aureus clinical isolates exhibited three closely migrating bands of activity as previously determined for laboratory strains of S. aureus: SodM, SodA, and a hybrid composed of SodM and SodA (M. W. Valderas and M. E. Hart, J. Bacteriol. 183:3399-3407, 2001). In contrast, the CoNS produced only one SOD activity, which migrated similarly to SodA of S. aureus. Southern analysis of eight CoNS species identified only a single sod gene in each case. A full-length sod gene was cloned from Staphylococcus epidermidis and determined to be more similar to sodA than to sodM of S. aureus. Therefore, this gene was designated sodA. The deduced amino acid sequence of the S. epidermidis sodA was 92 and 76% identical to that of the SodA and SodM proteins of S. aureus, respectively. The S. epidermidis sodA gene expressed from a plasmid complemented a sodA mutation in S. aureus, and the protein formed a hybrid with SodM of S. aureus. Both hybrid SOD forms as well as the SodM and SodA proteins of S. aureus and the S. epidermidis SodA protein exist as dimers. These data indicate that sodM is found only in S. aureus and not in the CoNS, suggesting an important divergence in the evolution of this genus and a unique role for SodM in S. aureus.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. The in vitro activity of T-3912 against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the MIC90 for the clinical isolates. The activity of T-3912 was not influenced by grlA mutation in S. aureus, and the degree of MIC increase of T-3912 for grlA-gyrA double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). The inhibitory activity of T-3912 was compared with other quinolones for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV of S. aureus SA113. T-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes among the quinolones tested. The isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for S. aureus SA113 and P. acnes JCM 6425, respectively. Furthermore, resistance to T-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. T-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. T-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by S. aureus SA113, P. acnes JCM6425 and multidrug-resistant S. aureus F-2161. These results indicate that T-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. METHODS: In all, 49 different isolates were studied. Each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. Plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 values, r=0.9. Gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 than Gram-positive bacteria. Group G streptococci (GGS) induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group A streptococci (GAS). Klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. GGS induced higher levels of IL-6 than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. When the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. CONCLUSION: Species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - The bacterial peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe inhibits killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis by human neutrophils in fibrin gels.
AB  - To study human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)) migration and killing of bacteria in an environment similar to that found in inflamed tissues in vivo, we have used fibrin gels. Fibrin gels (1500 microm thick) containing Staphylococcus epidermidis were formed in Boyden-type chemotaxis chambers. PMN migrated < 300 microm into these gels in 6 h and did not kill S. epidermidis when the gels contained heat-inactivated serum, C5-deficient serum, a streptococcal peptidase specific for a fragment of cleaved C5 (C5a), or anti-C5aR IgG. In contrast, in gels containing normal human serum, PMN migrated approximately 1000 microm into the gels in 4 h and into the full thickness of the gels in 6 h, and killed 90% of S. epidermidis in 6 h. fMLP reduced PMN migration into fibrin gels and allowed S. epidermidis to increase by approximately 300% in 4 h, whereas leukotriene B(4) stimulated PMN to migrate the full thickness of the gels and to kill 80% of S. epidermidis in 4 h. We conclude that both complement opsonization and C5a-stimulated chemotaxis are required for PMN bacterial killing in fibrin gels, and that fMLP inhibits PMN bactericidal activity in fibrin gels. The latter finding is surprising and suggests that in the presence of fibrin fMLP promotes bacterial virulence.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - The evaluation of microbial contamination in platelet concentrates prepared by two different methods.
AB  - The microbial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) prepared by two different methods both with a high risk of bacterial contamination during preparation and storage were evaluated. For apheresis platelets, the concentrates were obtained using the Haemonetics MCS 3P device. For the random method, platelets were obtained by two phase centrifugation, in the Heraeus Cryofuge 8500 I device using the Kansuk 3-way bags which permit storage for five days. 1620 plateletpheresis units prepared by apheresis, and 9838 units prepared by the random method, were included in the study. Of the 11,458 PCs studied. 32 (0.27%) were false positives and 24 (0.2%) were real positives. All of the positive results occurred in platelets prepared by the random method. C. xerosis and S. epidermidis, S. hominis, Alpha-hemolytic streptococci, all flora of the skin, were isolated in the contaminated concentrates. The risk of microbial contamination of PCs, prepared both by apheresis and from whole blood, continues at a low rate although the products were collected into specific bags following rules including appropriate disinfection of the skin, correct centrifugation collection time and optimal storage conditions including temperature and agitation. These results again emphasize the importance of: obeying phlebotomy rules and hand disinfection of the person who collects the blood as well as the need for careful skin decontamination of the donor, during donation.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin with ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone. The in-vitro antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against 165 streptococcal isolates, 369 staphylococcal isolates, and 50 enterococcal isolates recently recovered from clinical isolates. Gatifloxacin was the most active agent tested against streptococci including penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL). Imipenem and gatifloxacin (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL) were the most active agents tested against viridans group streptococci. All the agents demonstrated excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and gatifloxacin had good activity against methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis. Among the methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci tested, gatifloxacin was the most active agent. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gatifloxacin were the most active agents against E. faecalis. Thus, gatifloxacin possesses equal or superior activity when compared to ciprofloxacin and beta-lactams making it a promising new fluoroquinolone for clinical use in treating Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Prosthetic patch infection after carotid endarterectomy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: prospective audit of the management and outcome of prosthetic patch infection after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) at Leicester Royal Infirmary plus review of the literature. RESULTS: 8/936 CEA patients (0.85%) developed a prosthetic patch infection. Responsible organisms included MRSA (n=3), Staphylococcus epidermidis(n=2), haemolytic Streptococcus (n=1), Staphylococcus aureus(n=1) and Pseudomonas (n=1). Early wound complications preceded 4/5 infections presenting within 9 weeks of surgery. In addition to systemic antibiotics and debridement, management included patch removal and: (i) carotid ligation (n=3), vein patch repair (n=1), vein bypass (n=3). One patient had antibiotic irrigation of the in-situpatch. No patient died, one suffered a disabling postoperative stroke and two had temporary cranial nerve injuries. Including this series, a literature review identified 43 prosthetic patch infections, 91% culturing Staphylococci or Streptococci. Cumulative freedom from perioperative stroke/death or re-infection was 65% at 2 years. Patients treated by patch excision and autologous venous reconstruction had the best outcome with a cumulative freedom from perioperative stroke/death or re-infection of 91% at 2 years. CONCLUSION: prosthetic patch infection after CEA is rare. This study emphasises the importance of close surveillance of early wound complications. Surgical decision-making, especially the safety of carotid ligation, was facilitated by access to transcranial Doppler.
TI  - Clear corneal wound infection after phacoemulsification.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clear corneal wound infections after phacoemulsification.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 7 patients with clear corneal wound infections after phacoemulsification were reviewed retrospectively. Data that were reviewed included patient age, sex, onset of symptoms and signs after surgery, possible risk factors for infection, concomitant ocular disease, use of perioperative prophylactic antibiotics and steroids, culture and antibiotic sensitivity results, treatment regimen, and outcome. RESULTS: The median onset of signs and symptoms after surgery was 10 days (range, 4-60 days). Corneal cultures yielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 2 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1 case, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1 case. Cultures yielded no microorganisms for 1 patient. Corneal cultures were not obtained in 2 patients. In 3 of the 4 culture-positive cases, the isolated microorganisms were resistant to the perioperative prophylactic antibiotics (fluoroquinolones and tobramycin) that were used. No possible risk factors were noted except use of topical steroids 4 times a day without antibiotic coverage for iritis before referral in one of our patients. Six of these 7 wound infections healed with topical antibiotic therapy. One of the patients required lamellar keratectomy and conjunctival flap for complete healing. In 4 of the 7 cases, best-corrected visual acuity at the last follow-up visit was better than 20/40. CONCLUSIONS: Clear corneal wound infection after phacoemulsification is a serious complication of cataract surgery. Infections are caused by gram-positive organisms sensitive to bacitracin and the combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but often resistant to aminoglycosides and/or fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, Xenopus tropicalis (Pipidae).
AB  - Seven peptides (XT-1-XT-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from Xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. Peptides XT-5 and XT-3 are probably the orthologs of X. laevis peptide glycine-leucine amide (PGL(a)) and the N-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. XT-1, XT-6 and XT-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of X. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs XT-2 and XT-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. Orthologs of the magainins were not identified. The C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide XT-7 (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 5 microM, Escherichia coli 5 microM, and Candida albicans 40 microM) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus group C, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. The peptide was, however, hemolytic against human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microM). Circular dichroism studies showed that XT-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, pH 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. Decreasing the cationicity of XT-7 either by replacement of the C-terminal CONH2 group by COOH or by deletion of the Lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.
TI  - Staphylococci in orthopaedic surgical wounds.
AB  - From 50 infected surgical wounds of orthopaedic patients, 43 (86%) staphylococcal strains were isolated. 34 of all these staphylococci belonged to Staphylococcus aureus species (i.e. 68 % of all isolates from surgical wounds; 79% of staphylococcal isolates); 9 were coagulase-negative staphylococci (i.e. 21% of all isolates from surgical wounds; 18% of staphylococcal isolates). Among microorganisms isolated from the wounds we also found 2 (4%) of the Enterobacteriaceae family; 2 (4%) of the Pseudomonas genus; 3 (6%) of the Streptococcus genus. Thus, orthopaedic surgical wounds were infected by staphylococci (mainly S. aureus) more frequently than by other micro-organisms. All the staphylococcal strains were screened for methicillin resistance by agar disk diffusion testing and for the presence of mecA gene responsible for methicillin resistance by PCR. 32% of the S. aureus and 33% of the S. epidermidis strains resulted methicillin resistant and mecA-positive. The data confirm the diffusion of methicillin resistant S. aureus in surgical site infections and shows that the so-called "new pathogens", i.e. S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, also exhibit a frequent and hazardous methicillin-resisting ability.
TI  - Infection in total knee replacement: a retrospective review of 6489 total knee replacements.
AB  - Six thousand four hundred eighty-nine knee replacements were done in 6120 patients at the authors' institution between 1993 and 1999. Operations were done in a theater with vertical laminar flow and with the surgical team using body exhaust suits. Of these knee replacements, 116 knees became infected and 113 were available for followup. One hundred of the infections occurred in patients undergoing primary knee replacement, whereas the remaining infections occurred in patients undergoing revision knee replacement. Ninety-seven of these knees (86%) had deep periprosthetic infections and the remaining 16 knees had superficial wound infections. One third of the deep infections occurred within the first 3 months after surgery and the remaining 2/3 occurred after 3 months. The overall early deep infection rate for patients undergoing a primary knee replacement was 0.39%, whereas the rate for patients undergoing a revision knee replacement was 0.97%. A cohort of noninfected knee replacements from patients matched for gender, age, and month of surgery was used as a control group. Those comorbidities that were statistically significant in increasing the risk of infection were prior open surgical procedures, immunosuppressive therapy, poor nutrition, hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a history of smoking. Patients undergoing revision procedures had a statistically higher risk of infection than did patients undergoing primary surgeries. If the surgery took longer than 2.5 hours, the risk of infection was increased significantly. There was no change in the infection rate when the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was decreased from 48 to 24 hours after surgery. The predominant infectious organisms were gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus Group B). Twenty percent of the knees that were infected clinically had no organisms that could be identified. In each case, the patient had been treated empirically at another institution with antibiotics before a culture of the joint was obtained.
TI  - Deep neck abscess: a retrospective review of 210 cases.
AB  - This study was performed to review our experience with deep neck abscesses (DNAs) and compare it to the experiences in the available literature, and to study changing trends within our patient population. We retrospectively studied 210 patients who had DNAs between 1981 and 1998. Peritonsillar abscesses and limited intraoral abscesses were excluded. Demographics, presentation, etiology, site of abscess, associated systemic diseases, bacteriology, radiology, treatment, airway management, and outcome were reviewed. We compared the entire group to those in the available literature and studied changing trends within this patient population. Dental infection (43%) was the most common cause, followed by intravenous drug abuse (12%) and pharyngotonsillitis (6%). The incidences of intravenous drug abuse and mandibular fractures as causes of DNA were 19% and 8%, respectively, during the period 1981 to 1990, but were only 1% each during the period 1991 to 1998. Streptococcus viridans was the most common pathogen (39% of positive cultures), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (22%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%). Lateral pharyngeal space abscess was the most common DNA (43%), followed by submandibular space abscess, Ludwig's angina, and retropharyngeal space abscess (28%, 17%, and 12%, respectively). Seventy-five percent of patients with true Ludwig's angina underwent tracheotomy. Nondental infections are no longer a significant etiologic factor in DNA. Streptococcus viridans has replaced S aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci as the most common pathogen. Lateral pharyngeal space abscess was the most common DNA; however, its incidence has progressively decreased over the past decade. Intravenous drug abuse and mandibular fractures are no longer major etiologic factors. Tracheotomy is indicated in patients with Ludwig's angina.
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - Comparative study of new benzenesulphonamide fluoroquinolones structurally related to ciprofloxacin against selected ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of benzenesulphonamide fluoroquinolones (BSFQs) I-III, new fluoroquinolones with a p-substituted benzenesulphonyl moiety attached to the C(7) piperazinyl ring of ciprofloxacin, were assessed in comparison with those of N-sulfanilylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone (NSFQ)-105 and ciprofloxacin for 133 Gram-positive clinical isolates. NSFQ-105 and BSFQ-I were the most active drugs. They were 16- to 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (eight- to 32-fold). A high degree of correlation was found between the MICs of the new compounds and ciprofloxacin for Staphylococcus spp. and E. faecalis. Staphylococci and enterococci exhibit cross-resistance to BSFQs and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Infective endocarditis in the elderly].
AB  - To elucidate clinical features of infective endocarditis in the elderly, 20 elderly patients aged > or = 60 years were compared in detail with 30 others aged < 60 years retrospectively. Twelve of the 20 elderly patients had a calcific aortic valve or an artificial device as a predisposing heart disease, whereas 16 middle-aged patients had mitral valve prolapse or congenital heart disease (p = 0.001). The prevalence of major extracardiac disorders such as neurological disease were higher in the elderly than in the middle (9/20 vs 3/30; p < 0.01). The frequency of infected valve was similar; mitral in 8, aortic in 11 and other valves or congenital defect in 2 in the elderly versus 14, 11 and 6, respectively in the middle. Among 39 patients in whom causative microorganisms were identified, staphylococcus epidermidis was most frequently identified in the elderly (5/20), whereas streptococcus species was found in the middle (12/30). Time from the onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis was usually delayed in the entire group; the delay was longer particularly in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients (72 +/- 87 vs 36 +/- 32 days; p < 0.1). Maximal body temperature was less in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients (38.5 +/- 0.7 vs 39.3 +/- 1.1 degrees C; p < 0.01), whereas peak level of C-reactive protein (10.4 +/- 6.1 vs 13.0 +/- 7.9 mg/dL), the incidences of heart failure (9/20 vs 10/30), and embolic complications (7/20 vs 10/20) were similar in the 2 groups. Cardiac operation was performed less in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients (9/20 vs 21/30; p < 0.08). Five elderly patients had disease-related mortality, whereas only one middle-aged patient died (p = 0.02). These results suggest that although predisposing heart disease and causative microorganism in infective endocarditis are different between the elderly and middle-aged patients, the incidence of major complications are similar. However, due to the delay of correct diagnosis in the elderly who usually have major extracardiac disorders, the prognosis of infective endocarditis in the elderly is poor.
TI  - Bacterial keratitis: a prospective clinical and microbiological study.
AB  - AIM: To define the clinical and microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis at the Jules Gonin Eye Hospital and to test the in vitro bacterial resistance. METHODS: Patients presenting with bacterial keratitis were prospectively followed; clinical features (age, risk factors, visual acuity) and response to therapy were analysed. Bacteriological profile was determined and the sensitivity/resistance of isolated strains were tested towards 12 ocular antibiotics (NCCLS disc diffusion test). RESULTS: 85 consecutive patients (mean age 44.3 (SD 20.7) years) were prospectively enrolled from 1 March 1997 to 30 November 1998. The following risk factors were identified: contact lens wear, 36%; blepharitis, 21%; trauma, 20%; xerophthalmia, 15%; keratopathies, 8%; and eyelid abnormalities, 6%. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 40%; Staphylococcus aureus, 22%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8%; others Streptococcus species, 5%; Pseudomonas, 9%; Moraxella and Serratia marcescens, 5% each; Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Alcaligenes xyloxidans, Morganella morganii, and Haemophilus influenza, 1% each. 1-15% of strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 13-22% to aminoglycosides, 37% to cefazolin, 18% to chloramphenicol, 54% to polymyxin B, 51% to fusidic acid, and 45% to bacitracin. Five of the 85 patients (5.8%) had a poor clinical outcome with a visual loss of one or more lines of visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Fluoroquinolones appear to be the therapy of choice for bacterial keratitis, but, based upon these in vitro studies, some strains may be resistant.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ABT-773, a novel antibacterial ketolide.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ABT-773, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin were compared. ABT-773 was the most active compound against macrolide-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. It also had good activity against gram-negative and atypical respiratory tract pathogens and Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Structure and dissemination of a chromosomal insertion element encoding macrolide efflux in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Macrolide resistance associated with macrolide efflux (mef) has rapidly increased in Streptococcus pneumoniae. We defined the genetic structure and dissemination of a novel mefE-containing chromosomal insertion element. The mefE gene was found on the 5' end of a 5.5- or 5.4-kb insertion designated as the macrolide efflux genetic assembly (mega), which is found in > or =4 distinct sites of the pneumococcal genome. The element was transformable and conferred macrolide resistance to susceptible S. pneumoniae. The first 2 open-reading frames (ORFs) of the element formed an operon composed of mefE and a predicted adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette homologous to msrA. Convergent to this efflux operon were 3 ORFs with homology to stress response genes of Tn5252. Mega was related to the recently described mefA-containing element Tn1207.1 but lacked the genes necessary for transposition and had unique termini and insertion sites. In metropolitan Atlanta, macrolide resistance due to mega rapidly increased in S. pneumoniae by clonal expansion and horizontally by transformation.
TI  - Post-antibiotic growth suppression of linezolid against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against Gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed using the sigmoid E(max) model for mathematically modelling the PAE. Mean maximal linezolid PAEs against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the PAE. Results of PAE testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.
TI  - The replicon of the cryptic Plasmid pSBO1 isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1.
AB  - The cryptic plasmid pSBO1 (3904 bp) was isolated from Streptococcus bovis JB1. pSBO1 contained an open reading frame (ORF) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (Rep) in pEFC1 (isolated from Enterococcus faecalis), pSK639 (Staphylococcus epidermidis), pLA103 (Lactobacillus acidophilus), and pUCL287 (Tetragenococcus halophila). In addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (DRs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of pSBO1. Recombinant plasmids (pSBE10 and pSBE11) containing the DRs and putative rep of pSBO1 replicated in S. bovis 12-U-1 and no8 strains. This result indicates that the putative rep encoded Rep and that the replicon of pSBO1 contained the DRs and the rep. Gel shift assays showed that the Rep of pSBO1 bound the 22-bp DRs.
TI  - Resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  - We studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. No spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for Staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for Streptococcus pneumoniae). Population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. Assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. Stable S. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. The daptomycin MICs for these isolates were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. Many mutants with high MICs (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of S. aureus small colony variants. The voltage component (Delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. In vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. For other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. These results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Endophthalmitis after keratoprosthesis: incidence, bacterial causes, and risk factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of endophthalmitis in a group of patients with  keratoprostheses and to analyze possible risk factors. METHODS: A total of 108 patient eyes, operated on between 1990 and 2000 with double-plated keratoprostheses, were analyzed with regard to the surface flora, the incidence and cause of bacterial endophthalmitis or sterile vitreitis, the keratoprosthesis design, prophylactic antibiotics, concomitant immunosuppression, and preoperative diagnosis. RESULTS: Surveillance cultures were obtained from 30 uninfected eyes. The flora was similar to that reported in the normal population and did not vary significantly with time. Thirteen cases of bacterial endophthalmitis occurred 2 to 46 months postoperatively in the patient population that had been followed up for 2 months to 17 years (average, 3 years 4 months). The incidence was 39% in 13 patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 19% in 27 patients with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and 7% in 28 patients with ocular burns. Only 1 of the other 40 cases (consisting mostly of repeated graft failures in noncicatrizing conditions) developed endophthalmitis; this patient had a filtering bleb. All endophthalmitis pathogens were gram positive: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 23%; other streptococci, 39%; Staphylococcus aureus, 23%; and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 15%. CONCLUSIONS: The most important risk factor for endophthalmitis after these keratoprostheses was found to be preoperative diagnosis. The rate of infection was very high in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, moderate in chemical burns, and low in noncicatrizing corneal disease.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - Monocytes augment bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor activity in bacterium-infected human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  - In bacterial endocarditis (BE), intravascular infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis can lead to formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart and cause heart dysfunction. The events that start the coagulation in the early stage of the disease are largely unknown. We have recently shown that human endothelial cells (EC) upon binding and internalization of S. aureus, but not S. sanguis or S. epidermidis, express tissue factor (TF)-dependent procoagulant activity (TFA). The present study shows that infection of EC with these three pathogens induces surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte adhesion. Subsequent coculture of these cells synergistically enhanced TFA, which was exclusively dependent on TF molecules that were expressed on EC during coculture. TFA induction required direct contact between monocytes and bacterium-infected EC, but the signals for this response were not generated by the binding of monocytes through their beta(2)- or alpha(4)-integrins to ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, respectively, on infected EC. The mechanism by which monocytes induce TFA in bacterium-infected EC was partly mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 produced by the cells during coculture. Endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha was not involved. This modulating effect of monocytes on species- and strain-dependent TFA of bacterium-infected EC supports our hypothesis that in an early stage in the pathogenesis of BE, as well as other intravascular infections that lead to detrimental fibrin formation, the coagulation cascade can be activated on the surfaces of EC as a consequence of specific interactions between pathogenic bacteria, EC, and monocytes.
TI  - Comparative assessment of chemical and gamma-irradiation procedures for implantable glucose enzyme electrodes.
AB  - Chemical and gamma-irradiation sterilisation were examined in this study for implantable needle electrodes. Exposure to isopropyl alcohol (IPA) led to response elevation, but time-dependent exposures up to 30 min variously to chlorhexidine, H2O2, HCl, HCl/IPA, and alcoholic iodine/potassium iodide, all caused substantial time-dependent response degradation. Sterility was not assessed for such electrodes. High dose (30 KGy) gamma-irradiation also compromised sensor response, with exposed electrodes exhibiting approximately 30% reduction in response, comparable in magnitude to 10 min exposure to chemical sterilisation. However, a lower dose (25 KGy) gamma-irradiation was well tolerated and subsequent microbiological testing (following contamination with Streptococcus epidermidis and Staphylococus aureus) proved device sterility with no culture growth following 7 days incubation at 37 degrees C in brain heart infusion medium.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - Killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes photosensitizers and light. Whereas PDT use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial PDT (APDT) is still in its early stages of development. OBJECTIVES: To study microbial killing in vitro using APDT. METHODS: We used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. Using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mW cm(-2)) and methylene blue dye at 100 microg mL(-1), kill rates and subsequent D-values were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: D-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. The effects of light intensity on the killing of S. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. A high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that APDT of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - An in vitro pharmacokinetic model was used to compare the pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against 3 Staphylococcus aureus and 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Logarithmic-phase cultures were inoculated into the peripheral compartment of hollow-fiber cartridges and exposed to the peak serum concentrations achieved in humans with oral doses of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (500 mg). Drugs were added at 0 and 24 h, elimination kinetics were simulated, and changes in viable bacterial counts were evaluated over the course of 36 h. Moxifloxacin was bactericidal against all 6 staphylococci (times to 99.9% kill, 1-3 h). Against most strains, bacterial killing continued through 36 h, with total kills exceeding 5.5 logs. Levofloxacin was bactericidal against 5 of the strains, with similar times to 99.9% kill. In contrast to moxifloxacin, however, resistant subpopulations emerged in 4 strains during therapy with levofloxacin, and this could have important implications for treatment of staphylococcal infections. These in vitro observations warrant the clinical evaluation of moxifloxacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Comparative chemotherapeutic efficacy of balhimycin, desgluco-balhimycin against  experimental MSSA and MRSA infection in mice.
AB  - Balhimycin and desglucobalhimycin are glycopeptide antibiotics isolated from an Amycolatopsis spp during the search for novel antibacterials against MRSA from the natural product screening at the Research Centre of formerly Hoechst India Ltd. in Bombay, India. Both compounds show excellent in vitro activity against methicillin sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA). Both compounds were also found to be active against a number of MRSA strain in the animal studies. The activities were comparable to that of the reference glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin used in these studies. Teicoplanin displayed better in vivo efficacy against S. epidermidis 4929H and Streptococcus pyogenes A77 than either vancomycin or desgluco-balhimycin in the present study. Preliminary studies on pharmacokinetic and acute toxicity were done to get some idea at the early stage of the investigation about the promise of the compounds for development.
TI  - [Bacteriologic evaluation of middle ear fluid during the course of secretory otitis media in children].
AB  - Fluid collected from tympanic cavity during operation from 43 children with O.M.S. was subjected to bacteriological examination. After the collection, each sample was immediately applied to Bactec Peds Plus/F liquid medium from Becton Dickinson. The number of samples, where each genus and species of bacteria were found, was determined, as well as the number of samples where every two genus coexisted; also the pH genes, in which each genus was found were calculated. Obtained results showed that 22 species of bacteria, belonging to 6 genus lived in the samples. The most commonly occurring genus were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Haemophilus; the most rare genus were Moraxella and Bacillus. The most common species were: Haemophilus influenzae (18.6% of samples), Staphylococcus aureus (14.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.6%), Staphylococcus warneri (9.3%) and Streptococcus oralis (7.0%). Streptococcus coexisted most frequently with Staphylococcus and Haemophilus; Staphylococcus--with Haemophilus and Bacillus; Haemophilus--with Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. The pH ranges for the three most often found genus were: for Staphylococcus--7.7-9, for Streptococcus--7.7-9.3 and for Haemophilus--8.2-8.8.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.
TI  - Origins of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus oralis causing bacteraemia in a bone marrow transplant patient.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients is often associated with the use of central venous catheters, while the proposed origin of viridans streptococci causing bacteraemia in this patient group is the oral cavity. This report describes an episode of polymicrobial bacteraemia caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus oralis followed by several further episodes of S. epidermidis bacteraemia in a 15-year-old boy after bone marrow transplantation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI chromosomal DNA digests was used to compare blood culture and oral isolates of S. epidermidis and Str. oralis. The results indicated that the mouth was the source of both S. epidermidis and Str. oralis causing the first episode of bacteraemia. PFGE further demonstrated that the central venous catheter was the origin of a second strain of S. epidermidis responsible for subsequent episodes of staphylococcal bacteraemia. Both the oral mucosa and central venous lines should be considered as potential sources of organisms, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, associated with bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Limited role of direct exchange arthroplasty in the treatment of infected total hip replacements.
AB  - A literature review was performed to determine when direct exchange was most likely to be successful. Twelve reports provided outcome data on infected hip replacements treated with direct exchange. The average duration of followup was 4.8 years, but the range was broad (0.1-17.1 years). Of the 1,299 infected hip replacements treated with direct exchange, 1,077 (83%) were thought to be free of infection at the last followup. Antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was used in 1,282 of the cases (99%). There was wide variability in the duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy, ranging from just 24 hours to as many as 8 weeks. In some cases, no oral antibiotics ever were given, whereas in others, oral antibiotics were given for as many as 8 months after parenteral therapy. Factors associated with a successful direct exchange included: (1) absence of wound complications after the initial total hip replacement; (2) good general health of the patient; (3) methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species; and (4) an organism that was sensitive to the antibiotic mixed into the bone cement. Factors associated with failure included: (1) polymicrobial infection; (2) gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas species; and (3) certain gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Group D Streptococcus. Methicillin-resistant organisms have become more common. Many current revision surgical techniques use cementless implants. Fixation without any cement (no depot antibiotics) may be a contraindication to direct exchange. Additionally, there essentially are no data on the use of bone graft in association with direct exchange. For these reasons, the indications for direct exchange are limited.
TI  - Use of rifampin-soaked gelatin-sealed polyester grafts for in situ treatment of primary aortic and vascular prosthetic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In situ treatment of artery/graft infection has distinct advantages compared to vessel excision and extra-anatomic bypass procedures. Based on animal studies of a rifampin-soaked, gelatin-impregnated polyester graft that demonstrated prolonged in vivo antibacterial activity, this antibiotic-bonded graft was used selectively in patients for in situ treatment of low-grade Gram-positive prosthetic graft infections or primary aortic infections not amenable to excision and ex situ bypass. METHODS: In a 5-year period (1995-1999), 27 patients with prosthetic graft infection (aortofemoral, n = 18, femorofemoral, n = 3; axillofemoral, n = 1) or primary aortic infection (mycotic aneurysm, n = 3; infected AAA, n = 2) underwent excision of the infected vessel and in situ replacement with a rifampin soaked (45-60 mg/ml for 15 min) gelatin-impregnated polyester graft. All prosthetic graft infections were low grade in nature, caused Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, 16; Staphylococcus aureus, 5; Streptococcus, 1), and were treated electively. Patients with mycotic aortic aneurysm presented with sepsis and underwent urgent or emergent surgery. RESULTS: Two (8%) patients died-1 as a result of a ruptured Salmonella mycotic aortic aneurysm and the other from methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection following deep vein replacement of an in situ replaced femorofemoral graft. No amputations or late deaths as the result of vascular infection occurred in the 25 surviving patients. Two patients developed recurrent infection caused by a rifampin-resistant S. epidermidis in a replaced aortofemoral graft limb and were successfully treated with graft excision and in situ autogenous vein replacement. Eighteen patients remain alive and clinically free of infection after a mean follow-up interval of 17 months. CONCLUSIONS: In situ replacement treatment using a rifampin-bonded prosthetic graft for low-grade staphylococcal arterial infection was safe, durable, and associated with eradication of clinical signs of infection. Failure of this therapy was the result of virulent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
TI  - Hepcidin, a urinary antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver.
AB  - Cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues involved in host defense. In insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. From human urine, we characterized a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, and we named it hepcidin (Hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its antimicrobial properties. Two predominant forms, Hepc20 and Hepc25, contained 20 and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Reverse translation and search of the data bases found homologous liver cDNAs in species from fish to human and a corresponding human genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. The full cDNA by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mRNA size on Northern blots. The liver was the predominant site of mRNA expression. The encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20-25-amino acid processed forms were found in urine. Hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus. Hepcidin may be a vertebrate counterpart of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced in the fat body of insects.
TI  - Comparative in vitro Activity of Meropenem Versus Other Extended-Spectrum Antimicrobial Agents Against 2,085 Clinical Isolates Tested in 13 Brazilian Centers.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is the second agent of its class to become available in Brazil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. This study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 Brazilian states. A total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between December 1995 and March 1996 were susceptibility tested using the Etest and following the NCCLS procedures. Meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/mL, except for Citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). Generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against Gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (MIC50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (MIC 50,3 microg/mL). Imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some Gram-positive specees oxacillin, including Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 50 of 0.75 microg/mL and 2 microg/mL respectively), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/mL and 0.094 microg/mL), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC 50 of 0.064 microg/mL and 0.5mg/mL). Against Streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (MIC 50, 0.016 microg/mL). The results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in Brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.
TI  - A high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the external eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution of bacteria on the external surface of eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to investigate the relationship between the frequency of bacterial colonization and the grade of atopy or ocular diseases associated with AD. DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six AD patients (mean age, 24.5 years) and 16 nonatopic, age-matched control participants (mean age, 25.5 years). INTERVENTION: The eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs were scraped with sterile swabs. These samples were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture media. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency distribution of bacteria isolated from the eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs. RESULTS: Bacteria isolated from AD patients were: Staphylococcus aureus in 21 of 36 patients (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in two patients); Staphylococcus epidermidis in two patients (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in one patient); other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in six patients;alpha-streptococcus in three patients; Corynebacterium species in three patients; Neisseria species in two patients; and Propionibacterium acnes in one patient. From the nonatopic control participants, we isolated S. aureus in one patient, S. epidermidis in two patients and alpha-streptococcus in one patient. S. aureus was isolated from 67% of the AD patients, and any type of bacteria was isolated from 86% of the patients. These rates were significantly higher than those of nonatopic control participants (6% S. aureus and 25% any bacteria). There was no significant relationship between the frequency distribution of bacteria and the grade of atopy or associated ocular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of bacterial colonization, especially S. aureus, were found in the conjunctival sacs and eyelid margins of AD patients. In case management of AD patients, this unique distribution of bacteria must be carefully considered.
TI  - Lack of effect of an externally applied electric field on bacterial adhesion to glass.
AB  - Deposition to glass of Streptococcus salivarius HB-C12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 3399 in a parallel plate flow chamber in the absence and presence of an externally applied electric field has been studied experimentally. No effect on bacterial adhesion, including initial deposition rates, numbers of adhering bacteria after 4 h, spatial distributions of adhering bacteria and air bubble induced detachment, was found. A theoretical analysis shows that electric fields applied over a 150 microm thin glass substratum do not have a sufficiently strong effect on its surface potential to influence bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of an ion-penetrable and ion-impenetrable bacterial strain to glass.
AB  - Deposition to glass of Streptococcus salivarius HB-C12 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 3399 in a parallel plate flow chamber has been studied as a function of ionic strength. Electrophoretic mobility measurements revealed that S. epidermidis 3399 possesses a thick ion-penetrable layer, probably associated with its encapsulation, while S. salivarius HB-C12 has an ion-impenetrable surface. Streaming potential measurements indicated that also the glass surface was covered with a relatively thin, ion-penetrable layer. Theoretical initial deposition rates of both strains to glass were obtained by numerically solving the convective-diffusion equation, while accounting for the ion-penetrability of the interacting surfaces. Experimentally, the initial deposition rate of the ion-penetrable strain S. epidermidis 3399 was found to be higher and less dependent on ionic strength than of the ion-impenetrable S. salivarius HB-C12, in accordance with theoretical expectations. Agreement between theoretical and experimental deposition rates could be obtained when glass was considered ion-penetrable when interacting with the ion-penetrable organism S. epidermidis 3399, while glass behaved as an ion-impenetrable surface when interacting with the ion-impenetrable S. salivarius HB-C12. Probably, interaction with an ion-impenetrable strain drives the diffuse double layer charges into the limited volume of the thin ion-penetrable layer on the glass, readily filling it up and making it appear ion-impenetrable. During interaction of glass with another ion-penetrable surface, as of S. epidermidis 3399, diffuse double layer charges move into both ion-penetrable surfaces, resulting in a much lower mobile charge density in the ion-penetrable layer on the glass which consequently continues to behave as ion-penetrable.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  - Development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. The normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. Within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. Horizontal spread of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. An ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. Prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. Prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. Experience from Scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of use is low (about 5%) and stable.
TI  - Infective endocarditis in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the predominant characteristics of patients receiving long-term dialysis who develop infective endocarditis (IE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all chronic hemodialysis patients who had IE at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, between 1983 and 1997. RESULTS: Twenty episodes of IE occurred in 17 patients. One patient had 3 episodes of IE, and 1 patient had 2 episodes of IE; each episode was caused by a different organism. The mean +/- SD age of our patients was 63 +/- 11 years; there were 13 males; 6 patients had diabetes mellitus; and the mean +/- SD duration of hemodialysis prior to IE was 24.2 +/- 20.5 months. This analysis included 10 episodes of IE (occurring in 9 patients) within the Mayo Clinic Dialysis System during which time 223,358 hemodialysis treatments were delivered, giving a rate of 10 IE episode per 223,336 hemodialysis treatments. Among all 20 IE episodes, there were 14 synthetic arteriovenous grafts, 4 permanent venous dialysis catheters, 2 temporary venous dialysis catheters, and 2 native arteriovenous fistulas (2 accesses in 2 patients), and access had been in place for a mean +/- SD of 15.9 +/- 18.6 months. The portal of infection was the hemodialysis access in 13 episodes of IE. The causative organisms for IE were Staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases, Enterococcus sp in 4 cases, viridans streptococcus in 3 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 cases, and 1 case each of Streptococcus bovis, group G beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Aspergillus sp. The mitral valve was involved in 9 cases, the aortic valve was involved in 5 cases, and the tricuspid and pulmonic valves were involved in 1 case each. Patient survival (after the first episode of IE) was 71% at 30 days; 53% at 60 days; and 35% at 1 year. Echocardiography was performed in 19 episodes of IE. The transthoracic echocardiogram was 62.5% sensitive and 40% specific for the presence of definite or probable vegetations. Univariate analysis for factors affecting 60-day survival show that presence of right-sided IE, vegetation size greater than 2.0 cm3, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and initial leukocyte count greater than 12.5 x 10(9)/L were poor prognostic factors. Aortic valve involvement carried a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Infective endocarditis in hemodialysis patients is relatively infrequent but has a high mortality. Patients with synthetic intravascular dialysis angioaccess (synthetic grafts and venous catheters) are more likely to develop IE than patients with native arteriovenous fistulas. Transesophageal echocardiography is a preferred echocardiographic study for suspected cases of IE. Prolonged antibiotic therapy is needed for all patients, and close monitoring is needed for patients with right-sided IE, large vegetations, diabetes mellitus, and an elevated leukocyte count.

TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Micro-organisms responsible for osteo-articular infections.
AB  - Identification of the aetiological agents responsible for bone and joint infections requires either hard to obtain specimens that are easy to interpret, or easy to obtain specimens of difficult interpretation. Isolates obtained by blood cultures, arthrocentesis, or trephine or surgical biopsy bone samples are usually clinically significant. In contrast, samples obtained from sinus tracts or through open wounds are very often easy to obtain but difficult to interpret. Micro-organisms such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common cause of infections around prosthetic joint materials but are usually of little significance when obtained from the sinus tract of a patient with chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia without osteosynthesis. Other micro-organisms to be interpreted with caution include Corynebacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. The most important families of antimicrobial agents and their utility in bone and joint infections are briefly reviewed at the end of the chapter. Bone and joint infections require long-term antimicrobial therapy based on the correct diagnosis and the appropriate selection of antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - [The treatment of bacterial vaginosis with Dalacin V cream].
AB  - To asses the efficiency of the 2% clindamycin phosphate creme given in 3 and 7 daily courses officially designer for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: The study includes 65 patients who have microbiological data for BV 11 of the women are pregnant (18.46%). The microbiological study includes there agent: Streptococcus agalactiae, E. colli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, Staphylococcus epidermidis et Enterococcus fecalis. The controls visit was assessed on the 7'] and 28'] day after the therapy. RESULTS: There were successful results on the 84.3% of the patients after 7 day course but in the 3-day course the good results were showed in 73.91% of the women. After the 28"] day there were only few successful results 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The clindamycin phosphate is more preferable method for the treatment of BV.
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Haemophilus influenzae. METHODS: For time-kill studies, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. Inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/mL in each antibiotic solution. Growth controls were included. Viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. RESULTS: In general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. At 0.5 x MIC, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. At 1.0 x MIC, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus within 30 minutes, and S. epidermidis and S. marcescens within 90 minutes. Overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for H. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of S. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. CONCLUSION: Time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. Both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.
TI  - Infectious keratitis in climatic droplet keratopathy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the ulcer characteristics, microbiologic data, and outcome of  infectious keratitis associated with climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK), suggesting that CDK is a predisposing factor for infectious keratitis. METHODS: Medical records of 32 patients (34 eyes) in whom infectious keratitis was seen in association with CDK were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected regarding the nature of CDK lesions, infiltrate characteristics, organisms isolated, and outcome. RESULTS: CDK was peripheral in 16 (47.1%) eyes, central in 8 (23.5%), and diffuse in 10 (29.4%). The CDK lesions were nodular and elevated in all eyes. The infiltrate was adjacent to the CDK lesions in 28 eyes (82.4%). The infiltrate size (widest dimension) ranged 2-6 mm in 18 eyes (52.9%) and was >6 mm in 7 (20.5%). The infiltrate was full thickness in 15 eyes (44.1%) and was involving up to the middle third of the corneal stroma in another 18 (52.8%). Hypopyon was seen in all. Bacteria were commonly isolated. Staphylococcus epidermidis (six eyes) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five eyes) were the common bacteria isolated. Resolution with medical treatment was seen in 20 (58.8%) eyes. CONCLUSIONS: CDK is a predisposing factor for infectious keratitis. Treatment should be considered for advanced and nodular lesions, even if they are peripheral, to prevent infectious keratitis.
TI  - Evaluation of gemifloxacin (SB-265805, LB20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (GEMI), formerly SB-265805 and LB20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. The present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. The reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. Selected results (number strains tested; MIC90 for GEMI/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for GEMI/trovafloxacin) were: Staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), S. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), Enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), E. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). Gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. Continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.
TI  - Role of monocytes in experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
AB  - In the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis (BE), the clotting system plays a cardinal role in the formation and maintenance of the endocardial vegetations. The extrinsic pathway is involved in the activation of the coagulation pathway with tissue factor (TF) as the key protein. Staphylococcus aureus is a frequently isolated bacterium from patients with BE. We therefore investigated whether S. aureus can induce TF activity (TFA) on fibrin-adherent monocytes, used as an in vitro model of BE. We also assessed in vivo in rabbits with catheter induced vegetations, the effect of S. aureus infection on vegetational TFA. In vitro experiments showed that adherent S. aureus induced TFA on fibrin-adherent monocytes which was optimal at a bacterium/monocyte ratio of 1 to 1. Monocyte damage occurred when this ratio exceeded 4 to 1 (visually) or 6 to 1 (propidium iodide influx) Consequently, TFA decreased. In vivo S. aureus led to very high bacterial numbers in the vegetations and a significant increase of their weight. However, TFA of infected vegetations was the same as of sterile ones. This may be due to the high bacteria to monocyte ratio as well as bacterium-induced monocyte damage. Teicoplanin treatment of infected rabbits reduced bacterial numbers in the blood and in the vegetations. Two-day treatment resulted in an increase of vegetational TFA, but after four-day treatment vegetational TFA dropped, most probably due to a suboptimal bacterium/monocyte ratio. S. aureus endocarditis in etoposide (Vepesid)-treated rabbits, leading to a selective monocytopenia, caused a rapid death of the animals. In these rabbits no vegetations were found at all. We conclude that, like Streptococcus sanguis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus is able to induce TFA in fibrin-adherent blood monocytes. In addition, monocytes have a protective effect during the course of S. aureus endocarditis.
TI  - Peritonitis prevention in CAPD: to mask or not?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of wearing a face mask to prevent peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) bag exchange. SETTING: Renal unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Two groups of patients on CAPD were compared: those performing bag exchange with (n = 24) and those without a face mask (n = 40). OUTCOMES: Occurrence of first episode of peritonitis and total number of episodes. RESULTS: No difference was found between groups with respect to probability of developing the first episode of peritonitis (p = 0.757). Patients holding university degrees had evidence of protection, with borderline significance [relative risk (RR) 0.52; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.23 -1.18; p= 0.109]. Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis also demonstrated a significant protective factor for patients with university level education (RR 0.42; Cl 95%, 0.18 - 0.98; p = 0.04). Incidence of peritonitis was not significantly different between groups: with-mask group had 1.0 episode/year, and without-mask group had 0.94 episodes/year. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly identified agent. Staphylococcus aureus was found more frequently in the with-mask group (p = 0.003). Peritonitis due to Streptococcus viridans and Enterococci were detected only in the without-mask group. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that routine use of face masks during CAPD bag exchanges may be unnecessary and could be discontinued.
TI  - Musculoskeletal infections in intravenous drug addicts: report of 34 cases with analysis of microbiological aspects and pathogenic mechanisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse characteristics of musculoskeletal infections in Spanish intravenous (i.v.) drug addicts. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 34 medical records was carried out and the aetiologic agent was confirmed in all cases. RESULTS: The mean age was 26 years and the sex ratio was 25M/9F. Twenty-four patients were HIV-positive and 10 HIV-negative. There were no differences between the 2 subgroups. Septic arthritis, seen in 27 cases (79%), was the most common type of infection. Axial involvement was present in 23 cases (67%). The organisms isolated included Staphylococcus aureus (25 cases), Candida albicans (3 cases), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2 cases), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes in one case each. Candida albicans affected the sternocostal joints. Laboratory data showed non-specific findings. The outcome was mostly good and only one patient died. CONCLUSION: Human immunodeficiency virus does not affect characteristics of musculoskeletal infections in i.v. drug addicts. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequently isolated pathogen in this population.
TI  - Effect of radiographic contrast agents on leukocyte metabolic response.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of radiographic contrast media in the setting of possible bowel ischemia and potential perforation is known to carry a risk of morbidity and mortality. However, studies of the effect of available contrast media on host immunological defense mechanisms are lacking. We have examined the effect of barium and of two water-soluble contrast agents of differing iodine concentration and osmolality, Conray 30 and Cysto Conray II, on leukocyte phagocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were incubated with the contrast media alone (termed the "resting state"), and in combination with a standard phagocytic challenge (Zymosan polysaccharide extract) and with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, to determine the effect of contrast media upon leukocyte phagocytic response. Incubation with saline was used as control. In the case of barium, the "resting state" and standard challenge experiments were repeated at nine dilutions, ranging from 1:1 to 1:1000. The leukocyte phagocytic response was measured in two ways: CO2 generation (an index of metabolic activity) and chemiluminescence (an index of generation of reactive oxygen species and bacterial killing). RESULTS: Barium, at clinical dilutions, causes a significant increase of baseline "resting state" phagocytic activity, which in turn leads to significant blunting of subsequent response to phagocytic challenge and adversely affects the response to all bacteria tested. There is no baseline activation of leukocytes by the water-soluble media, although there was some inhibition (rather than activation) of leukocyte metabolic activity. The effect of the water-soluble media on bacteria was more complex (although inhibition is minor compared to barium). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that barium is a significant activator of phagocytic cells, which results in deactivation of phagocytic response when challenged; these data serve to explain the enhanced adverse effect of barium in cases of fecal peritonitis.
TI  - The fib locus in Streptococcus pneumoniae is required for peptidoglycan crosslinking and PBP-mediated beta-lactam resistance.
AB  - Penicillin resistance in pneumococci is mediated by modified penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that have decreased affinity to beta-lactams. In high-level penicillin-resistant transformants of the laboratory strain Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 containing various combinations of low-affinity PBPs, disruption of the fib locus results in a collapse of PBP-mediated resistance. In addition, crosslinked muropeptides are highly reduced. The fib operon consists of two genes, fibA and fibB, homologous to Staphylococcus aureus femA/B which are also required for expression of methicillin resistance in this organism. FibA and FibB belong to a family of proteins of Gram-positive bacteria involved in the formation of interpeptide bridges, thus representing interesting new targets for antimicrobial compounds for this group of pathogens.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (SB-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of Gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis) and Gram-positive wound infection resulting from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. Oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. Around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. In the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (P < 0.01) compared with no treatment. No comparator agent had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. Notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (P < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against E. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were inferior (P < 0.01) against P. mirabilis infection. In the S. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (P < 0.01). Results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (P > 0.05). Gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (P < 0.01). No comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against S. pyogenes or S. aureus infections. These data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of Gram-negative urinary tract infection and Gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - [The structure and antibiotic sensitivity of the causative agents of community-acquired infectious diseases of bacterial origin in children].
AB  - Four hundred and forty pediatric patients at the age of 7 days to 15 years with various infections admitted to the Hospital within a month were examined. The biological material was inoculated to blood agar on the first days of the patient admittance to the Hospital and after the growth the organisms were isolated and identified. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was assayed with the disk diffusion method. 479 strains in all were tested. The most frequent cases requiring hospitalization and antibiotic therapy were those of respiratory tract infections (54.09 per cent), urinary tract infections (26.36 per cent), cutaneous and subcutaneous fat diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and others (about 25 per cent of the cases in all). The main pathogens were Streptococcus viridans, S.aureus and S.epidermidis, as well as Enterobacteriaceae (chiefly E.coli) whose frequencies were practically equal (in 25-35 per cent of the cases). The Pneumococcus isolates amounted to 6.3 per cent. Nonfermenting bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter) and some representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, Serratia, Morganella) were isolated from 7 per cent of the patients. The frequency of Klebsiella and Enterobacter was about 11 per cent. The main pathogens were tested for their susceptibility to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin. The least active antibiotic was ampicillin. 88.8 per cent of the E.coli isolates and 100 per cent of the Klebsiella, P.mirabilis, Morganella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Serratia isolates were resistant to it. 53.2 per cent of the Streptococcus isolates including 64.5 per cent of the Pneumococcus isolates were as well resistant to ampicillin. 59.5 per cent of the Streptococcus isolates (mainly S.viridans and Enterococcus) was susceptible to oxacillin, 22.2 per cent of them being moderately susceptible. 62.5 per cent of the Pneumococcus isolates and 78.1 per cent of the Staphylococcus isolates were also susceptible to oxacillin. The highest susceptibility of the isolates was that to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, i.e. 90.1 per cent of the strains, 79.9 per cent of them being highly susceptible. All the isolates of Citrobacter, Serratia and Morganella and some isolates of P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and E.coli were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. As for the latter 5 organisms their susceptibility to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid was comparable with that to gentamicin. The susceptibility of the Streptococcus and Staphylococcus isolates to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid was significantly much higher than that to oxacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin: 93 per cent of the Streptococcus isolates (62.7 per cent of the Pneumococcus isolates) and 90.7 per cent of the Staphylococcus isolates.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  - Mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The MICs were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. These concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. Mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. Mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. We identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine, quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. These had activities similar to that of mefloquine against S. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (MICs for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). They had activities similar to that of amphotericin B against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. Combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. The MIC and MBC of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. There was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. The compounds were rapidly bactericidal. They appear to act by disrupting cell membranes. Combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - A shift from oral to blood pH is a stimulus for adaptive gene expression of Streptococcus gordonii CH1 and induces protection against oxidative stress and enhanced bacterial growth by expression of msrA.
AB  - Viridans group streptococci (VS) from the oral cavity entering the bloodstream may initiate infective endocarditis (IE). We aimed to identify genes expressed in response to a pH increase from slightly acidic (pH 6.2) to neutral (pH 7.3) as encountered by VS entering the bloodstream from the oral cavity. Using a recently developed promoter-screening vector, we isolated five promoter fragments from the genomic DNA of Streptococcus gordonii CH1 responding to this stimulus. No common regulatory sequences were identified in these promoter fragments that could account for the coordinate expression of the corresponding genes. One of the isolated fragments contained the promoter region and 5' end of a gene highly homologous to the methionine sulfoxide reductase gene (msrA) of various bacterial and eukaryotic species. This gene has been found to be activated in S. gordonii strain V288 in a rabbit model of IE (A. O. Kilic, M. C. Herzberg, M. W. Meyer, X. Zhao, and L. Tao, Plasmid 42:67-72, 1999). We isolated and characterized the msrA gene of S. gordonii CH1 and constructed a chromosomal insertion mutant. This mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a role for the streptococcal MsrA in protecting against oxidative stress. Moreover, MsrA appeared to be important for the growth of S. gordonii CH1 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Both these properties of MsrA may contribute to the ability of S. gordonii to cause IE.
TI  - Bacteriology of endoscopically normal maxillary sinuses.
AB  - The bacteriology of maxillary sinuses with normal endoscopic findings is reported in this study. When transantral sinoscopy was used to examine the maxillary sinuses, the whole maxillary sinus was inspected with different-angle endoscopes. If no lesion was seen over the whole maxillary sinus mucosa, no secretion existed in the maxillary sinus cavity, and the maxillary sinus ostium was wide open, the maxillary sinus was considered endoscopically normal. The bacteriology of these endoscopically normal maxillary sinuses was studied by passing cotton-tipped sticks through the cannula to collect swab specimens. In some cases, a biopsy forceps was also passed to obtain mucosal specimens. The specimens were sent to the laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Between July 1990 and May 1998, 83 swab and 31 mucosal specimens were collected from 69 patients who had not taken any antibiotic within 10 days before endoscopy. The culture rates were 62.3 per cent (35/53) from swab specimens and 57.1 per cent (eight out of 14) from mucosal specimens in patients with the diagnosis of chronic paranasal sinusitis, and were 46.7 per cent (14/30) from swab specimens and 41.2 per cent (seven out of 17) from mucosal specimens in patients without this diagnosis. This study shows that endoscopically normal maxillary sinuses are not sterile.
TI  - Treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with topical lomefloxacin 0.3% compared to topical ofloxacin 0.3%.
AB  - PURPOSE: The main purpose of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy,  local tolerance, and safety of topical lomefloxacin 0.3% and topical ofloxacin 0.3% in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis were included in a randomized, prospective, parallel-group study. Twenty patients were assigned to the lomefloxacin group (Okacin, CIBA Vision Ophthalmics) and 20 patients to ofloxacin (Oflox, Allergan). Lomefloxacin 0.3% was given 1 drop every 2 hours during waking hours on the first day then twice daily for one week. Ofloxacin 0.3% eyedrops were given four times daily. All patients underwent eye examination and clinical findings were graded and recorded according to severity of lid hyperemia, lid edema, lid crusting, conjunctival edema and discharge, bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, palpebral conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, and ocular discomfort. The score for each clinical sign was recorded before and after treatment. The mean cumulative sum score (CSS) was obtained by adding the scores for signs and symptoms. All conjunctival swabs were cultured and tested for sensitivity. Patients with confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis were included. RESULTS: There were 10 male and 10 female patients in each group. The age range was from 1 to 78 years, and the mean age was 35 years in the lomefloxacin group. In the ofloxacin group the age range was from 1 to 70 years, and the mean age was 26 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups in relation to age or sex. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 16 cases (36%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococci in 9 (20%), Haemophilus spp. 6 (13%), Staphylococcus aureus 5 (11%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 4 (9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (7%), and other 2 (4%). The mean CSS for conjunctivitis was 12.1 before therapy in the lomefloxacin group and 12.7 in the ofloxacin group. On the 7th day of therapy, the mean CSS was 0.7 in the lomefloxacin group, and 1.6 for ofloxacin. All patients showed improvement, but a total of 18 out of 20 (88%) in the lomefloxacin group showed complete resolution compared to 15 (75%) in the ofloxacin group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Tolerance was excellent in both groups, and no side effects were reported. A burning sensation was noted by two patients, one in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Lomefloxacin and ofloxacin were equally effective and safe in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - Mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. Genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. In this study the binding of purified MBL to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. Diverse Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci exhibited strong binding of MBL, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. In contrast, beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. Bound MBL was able to promote C4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that MBL may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Antibacterial steroid alkaloids from the stem bark of Holarrhena pubescens.
AB  - Holarrhena pubescens (syn. H. antidysenterica) (L.) WALL. stem bark was tested for antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the microdilution broth method as well as the disc diffusion method. The crude methanolic extract was active against all tested bacteria. Further chemical fractionation indicated that the antibacterial activity was mainly associated with the alkaloids. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for the crude extract, the total alkaloids and the neutral fraction using microdilution broth method. The results were compared with reference antibiotics. The total alkaloids showed remarkable activity against S. aureus (MIC = 95 microg/ml).
TI  - Corneal ulceration in the elderly in Hyderabad, south India.
AB  - AIMS: To report demographic, microbiological, therapeutic, anatomical, and visual results of corneal ulceration in the elderly patients seen at a tertiary eye care centre in south India. METHODS: 102 consecutive cases of microbial keratitis in patients 65 years and older were studied. Inclusion criteria were: (i) presence of corneal stromal infiltrate upon slit lamp examination; and (ii) microbiological evaluation of corneal scrapings for suspected microbial keratitis. RESULTS: The principal predisposing factors identified in this study were ocular disease (38.2%), previous ocular surgery in the same eye (29.4%), trauma (17.6%), and severe systemic disease (16.7%). Contact lens wear was associated with only two cases (2.0%). 99 organisms were isolated in cultures of corneal scrapings from 74 (72.5%) of the 102 cases. Staphylococcus epidermidis (31.1%), filamentous fungi (25.7%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13.5%) were the most common isolates. 12 eyes (11.8%) required surgery, 15 (14.7%) eventually required evisceration, and nine (9.6%) of the 94 followed patients achieved an unaided vision of 20/60 or better at last follow up. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents the largest recent single centre study on (non-viral) microbial keratitis in the elderly, its management, and outcomes of therapy. While the predisposing factors differ from those of general population, the spectrum of microbes responsible for keratitis in the elderly appears to reflect the local microbial flora rather than a predilection for elderly patients. Delay in diagnosis and systemic conditions associated with advancing age probably contribute to poorer outcome from therapeutic measures.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - Risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.004-8.56), Apgar score after 1 min (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.36-12.12). There was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.07-17.40). Funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. The histological examination of the umbilical cord can be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of men 10700, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - We report here the antibacterial activity of the new penem antibiotic Men 10700 against a total of 740 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, in comparison to imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Men 10700 has shown a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity, with a potent activity both against gram-positive species (with the exception of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) as indicated by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) values < or =0.5 mg/l, and gram-negative species, with MIC(90) values generally < or =2 mg/l. Men 10700 was the most potent antibiotic against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. epidermidis, while the overall spectrum of activity resembled that of imipenem; meropenem was more active against most gram-negative species. In comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, Men 10700 demonstrated superior activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. epidermidis and some gram-negative species such as Morganella morganii, Serratia spp. and Enterobacter cloacae; moreover, in contrast to third-generation cephalosporins, Men 10700 showed moderate activity against Enterococcus spp. The activity of Men 10700 against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains) and some gram-negative strains selected for their resistance to cefotaxime (20 strains) was particularly interesting.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor in human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  - A cardinal process in bacterial endocarditis (BE) is the activation of the clotting system and the formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart, the so-called endocardial vegetation. The processes that lead to the activation of the clotting system on endothelial surfaces upon exposure to bacteria are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated in an in vitro model whether infection of human endothelial cells (EC) with bacteria that are relevant to BE, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, leads to induction of tissue factor (TF)-dependent procoagulant activity (TFA) and whether this process is influenced by host factors, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), that are produced in response to the bacteremia in vivo. The results show that S. aureus binds to and is internalized by EC, resulting in expression of TF mRNA and TF surface protein as well as generation of TFA within 4 to 8 h after infection. No TFA was found when EC were exposed to UV-irradiated S. aureus or bacterial cell wall fragments. S. sanguis and S. epidermidis, although also binding to EC, did not induce endothelial TFA. This indicates a species and strain dependency. EC also expressed TFA after exposure to IL-1. The enhanced TFA of EC after exposure to S. aureus was not prevented by IL-1 receptor antagonist, arguing against an auto- or paracrine contribution of endogenous IL-1. When IL-1 was applied together with bacteria, this had a synergistic effect on the induction of EC TFA. This was found in particular with S. aureus but also, although to a lesser degree, with S. sanguis and S. epidermidis. This influence of IL-1 on the species- and strain-dependent induction of EC TFA suggests that bacterial factors as well as host factors orchestrate the induction of coagulation in an early stage in the pathogenesis of endovascular disease, such as BE.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - The facilitating effect of cigarette smoke on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the tracheal lumen in rats and the improving influence of supplementary vitamin E on this process.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the direct influence of cigarette smoke on the bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and the effect of supplementary vitamin E on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the trachea of rats that do not have the chronic airway pathology associated with smoking. METHODOLOGY: Thirty male Wistar albino rats, weighing approximately 250 g, were used as experimental animals. A 0.1 mL bacterial suspension containing six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenza, Peptostreptococci spp.), isolated previously from pharynx of rats, were instilled into the trachea of three groups of rat (10 control, 10 cigarette smoke-treated and 10 cigarette smoke- and vitamin E-supplemented rats). The smoke-treated rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 days prior to and after intratracheal instillation. The third group of rats were given vitamin E supplements (100 mg/kg per day). Tracheobronchial lavage samples of all rats were quantitatively cultured after 3 days from the instillation. RESULTS: The colony numbers of isolated bacteria were significantly higher in cigarette smoke-treated rats than in the control group and in the smoke- and vitamin E-supplemented rats (P < 0.05). Only S. aureus and S. epidermidis were isolated from vitamin E-supplemented rats, while instilled all six bacterial species were isolated from the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that smoking impairs the elimination of bacteria or facilitates colonization of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of rats. Supplementary treatment with vitamin E reduces the effect of cigarette smoke; however, some bacteria may be resistant to this action of vitamin E.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis. Microbiological analysis as a principle for therapeutic recommendations].
AB  - PURPOSE: The study presented differentiates between the aetiological agents of bacterial keratitis in patients with and without a history of contact lens wear. Based on these results, recommendations are given for optimal antibiotic primary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Swabs and corneal scrapings were taken from 218 patients referred to the University Eye Hospital in Munich with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis from 1989 to 1997. Ninety-two of these patients had a history of contact lens wear; 126 had none. The germs were isolated and identified by staining and microscopy. Observing polymicrobial growth in 51 patients, a total of 275 germs was isolated. RESULTS: The most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (44%), S. aureus (18%), Streptococcus spp. (10%), Propionibacterium acnes (7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). Gram-negative germs were nearly exclusively isolated from contact lens wearers, gram-positive germs were predominant in non-contact lens wearers. CONCLUSION: Keratitis in patients with a history of contact lens wear is often caused by aggressive gram-negative germs. Those cases should immediately be treated with quinolones and erythromycin. In keratitis caused by gram-positive pathogens, a combination with aminoglycosides and erythromycin is sufficient.
TI  - Microbial flora variations in the respiratory tract of mice.
AB  - A stable microbial system in the respiratory tract acts as an important defense mechanism against pathogenic microorganisms. Perturbations in this system may allow pathogens to establish. In an ecological environment such as the respiratory tract, there are many diverse factors that play a role in the establishment of the indigenous flora. In the present work we studied the normal microbial flora of different areas of the respiratory tract of mice and their evolution from the time the mice were born. Our interest was to know which were the dominant groups of microorganisms in each area, which were the first capable of colonizing and which dominated over time to be used as probiotic microorganisms. Our results show that Gram negative facultatively anaerobic bacilli and strict anaerobic microorganisms were the last ones to appear in the bronchia, while aerobic and Gram positive cocci were present in all the areas of the respiratory tract. The number of facultative aerobes and strict anaerobes were similar in the nasal passage, pharynx instilled and trachea, but lower in bronchia. The dominant species were Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus saprophyticcus, followed by S. epidermidis, Lactobacilli and S. cohnii I which were present on every studied days but at different proportions. This paper is the first part of a research topic investigating the protective effect of the indigenous flora against pathogens using the mice as an experimental model.
TI  - Rapid detection of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolates by the MRSA-screen latex agglutination test.
AB  - The slide agglutination test MRSA-Screen (Denka Seiken Co., Niigata, Japan) was compared with the mecA PCR ("gold standard") for the detection of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. The MRSA-Screen test detected the penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) antigen in 87 of 90 genetically diverse methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) stock culture strains, leading to a sensitivity of 97%. The three discrepant MRSA strains displayed positive results only after induction of the mecA gene by exposure to methicillin. Both mecA PCR and MRSA-Screen displayed negative results among the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains (n = 106), as well as for Micrococcus spp. (n = 10), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 10), and Enterococcus spp. (n = 10) (specificity = 100%). Producing the same PBP2a antigen, all 10 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains score positived in both the latex test and the mecA PCR. Consequently, the MRSA-Screen test should be applied only after identification of the MRSA strain to the species level to rule out coagulase-negative staphylococci. In conclusion, due to excellent specificity and sensitivity the MRSA-Screen latex test has the potential to be successfully used for routine applications in the microbiology laboratory.
TI  - [The microbial cenosis of the tonsils in healthy children and in those frequently ill].
AB  - The microbial cenosis of tonsils has been studied in healthy and ailing children. It has been found out that Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, rarely gram-negative flora and candidae were most often isolated in the ailing children. Normal microflora of healthy children mainly included lactic acid bacteria whose level considerably decreased in ailing children that is most distinctly expressed in children with decompensated tonsillitis. To correct the disturbances in microbial cenosis during complex therapy we used lactobacteria to treat the nasopharynx with the suspension of these bacteria. Positive clinical effect with following positive results of bacteriological investigation has been obtained in all patients.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens in chronic otitis media with effusion in Alaska Native children.
AB  - This study examined the bacterial pathogens and the presence of possible risk factors for the development of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) in a group of Alaska Native children. Middle ear aspirates were collected from 128 children < 6 years of age requiring tympanocentesis between 1987 and 1989. Bacterial pathogens were cultured from 40% of 209 fluids. Predominant isolates, after contamination of the outer ear was controlled for, were Haemophilus influenzae (21%; 84% of these were nontypeable), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.1%; serotypes 6B, 10A, 11A, 14, 18B, 18C, 19A, and 23F), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.8%), and Moraxella (Brahmanella) catarrhalis (2.9%). Pneumococcal-C-polysaccharide (PnC) was detectable in 3 of 135 (2.2%) aspirates that did not grow Streptococcus pneumoniae. Combining culture and PnC assay results evidence of pneumococcal infection was found in almost 10% of aspirates tested. There was not a significant difference in the number of episodes of acute otitis media after the first year of life based on the age at the first episode (< 6 mo, > or = 6 mo). However, 88% of infants in the study had their first acute otitis media episode before 1 year of age.
TI  - Cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  - The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. Based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. The causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. The resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated germs were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. Frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by Staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to Streptococcus spp. In this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. Gram-negative germs like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). CONCLUSION: In contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. In such cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. To cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. The latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of Streptococcus spp. co-involvement.
TI  - Feglymycin, a novel inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus. Fermentation, isolation and structure elucidation.
AB  - The novel peptide feglymycin has been isolated from cultures of Streptomyces sp.  DSM 11171 by solid phase extraction, size exclusion chromatography and repeated reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular weight was found to be 1900.90 g/mol and the molecular formula is C95H97Nl3O30. Feglymycin contains 13 amino acids of which four are 3-hydroxyphenylglycine and five are 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residues. The structure of the linear peptide has been determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The sequence was confirmed by the observed mass spectroscopic fragmentation pattern. As well as having weak antibacterial activity, feglymycin inhibits the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro.
TI  - Removal of infected pacemaker leads with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and  open surgical exploration of the superior vena cava and innominate veins.
AB  - Despite the use of transvenous methods for extraction of infected leads, failed attempts may result in retained lead fragments. Retained lead fragments may be a focus of continued infection leading to sepsis. We present two patients in which conversion from cardiopulmonary bypass to hypothermic circulatory arrest allowed direct visualization, using venotomies in the superior vena cava and innominate vein to achieve complete removal of retained pacemaker lead fragments. Use of venotomies in the extracardiac venous system is a technical addition to prior descriptions of lead extraction using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.
TI  - [Investigations on the behavior of C-reactive protein, cell count, lactose content as well as electric conductivity in quarter milk samples of subclinically diseased quarters of the udders in relation to bacteriologic results].
AB  - Inflammations of the udder influence the amount of somatic cells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in milk. They are often caused by bacterial agents. Similar reactions are to be seen in relation to C-reactive protein (CRP). The amount of CRP in milk depends on concentration and characteristics of the agents and the phase of inflammation. We found a significant increase of CRP in milk samples with Streptococcus (Sc.) uberis. There was no significant difference in CRP concentrations in samples with coagulase positive Staphylococcus spp. (CPS) and bacteriological negative samples and such with Corynebacterium (C.) bovis, Micrococcus spp. and Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis. We only found high correlations to the amount of somatic sells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in samples with Sc. uberis. The results of our investigations show that CRP may be a parameter for better understanding subclinical inflammations of udder.
TI  - Vascular surgical society of great britain and ireland: In situ replacement of infected aortic grafts with rifampicin-bonded prostheses
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prosthetic graft infection following abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  surgery is life threatening. Treatment options include total graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass or in situ replacement of the graft. The latter option is gaining popularity but the long-term outcome remains uncertain, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. A retrospective study was undertaken to assess the outcome after graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis for the treatment of major aortic graft infection. The prevalence of MRSA and its influence on outcome was also assessed. METHODS: Over 6 years between January 1992 and December 1997, 11 patients (eight men) with major aortic graft infection underwent total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis. RESULTS: The median age was 66 (range 49-78) years. Four patients presented with haemorrhage from an aortoenteric fistula, three had retroperitoneal abscess, two had graft occlusion, one had a perigraft collection on computed tomography and one presented with a ruptured suprarenal false aneurysm. Organisms were cultured from ten patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis were predominant. MRSA was isolated from two patients, both of whom had originally undergone ruptured AAA repair. Two patients died and three suffered non-fatal complications. Two patients died during follow-up, one from suspected ongoing MRSA infection and the other from recurrent graft infection. Seven patients remain alive and clinically free from infection, although two were lost to follow-up at 12 and 15 months. CONCLUSION: The long-term results following total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis appear to be favourable. MRSA infection seems to be associated with a poor prognosis.
TI  - Co-occurrence of pneumococcal keratitis and dacryocystitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the specific risk factors responsible for the development of pneumococcal keratitis. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 383 patients of culture-proven bacterial keratitis, seen between 1991 and 1995, 139 had monobacterial isolates on culture. We analyzed the various predisposing factors in these patients, with special emphasis on the patency of nasolacrimal drainage system. RESULTS: Of the 139 patients with monobacterial keratitis, 48 (group 1) grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in culture. In the remaining 91 patients (group 2), Pseudomonas (18), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (15), Staphylococcus epidermidis (23), Staphylococcus aureus (16), Corynebacterium species (12), and others (seven) were isolated. Trauma was found to be a predisposing factor in 12 patients of group 1 and 27 patients of group 2 (p = 0.5601). Twelve (25%) patients of group 1 revealed chronic dacryocystitis, and nine of them underwent sac excision. On the contrary, only three patients of group 2 demonstrated dacryocystitis (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: These results underscore the importance of assessing the patency of lacrimal drainage system in patients with infectious keratitis, especially of pneumococcal origin.
TI  - New patterns of infecting organisms in late bleb-related endophthalmitis: a ten year review.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the risk factors, causative organisms and visual outcomes in patients with late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis. METHODS: Medical records of all patients with the clinical diagnosis of late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis undergoing vitreous aspirates for culture at our institution from January 1987 to July 1996 were reviewed. Late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis was defined as conjunctival injection, bleb purulence and intraocular inflammation developing at least 1 month following filtering surgery. RESULTS: Forty-nine cases of bleb-related endophthalmitis developed in 42 patients (23 men, 19 women). Mean patient age was 62.1 +/- 19.3 years (range 5-94 years). Thirty-nine patients underwent prior filtering surgery (superior trabeculectomy, 24 eyes; inferior trabeculectomy, 10 eyes; combined superior trabeculectomy/cataract extraction, 4 eyes; posterior lip sclerectomy, 1 eye) and 3 had inadvertent blebs following cataract extraction. Endophthalmitis developed an average of 25.4 +/- 23.5 months (range 1-96 months) post-operatively. Antifibrosis agents were used in 25 of 39 eyes undergoing filtering surgery (mitomycin C, 13 eyes; 5-fluorouracil, 12 eyes). Bleb leaks were documented in a total of 32 of 49 (65%) cases either before or at the time of endophthalmitis diagnosis. Vitreous cultures were positive in 42 of 49 (86%) cases. The most frequently cultured organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (13), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12), Streptococcus species (8) and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 32 of 49 (65%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcal species were the most frequently cultured organisms in this series and may be associated with better visual outcomes. Although a causal relationship cannot be established, these results suggest a strong association between bleb leaks and endophthalmitis.
TI  - Adherence of Staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  - A novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. A secreted protein, Eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of S. aureus Newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of S. aureus. Eap bound much less to cells of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, or Escherichia coli. The protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of S. aureus. Binding of S. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of Eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Hospitalization in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - Hospitalization rates are declining more rapidly for peritoneal dialysis (PD) than for hemodialysis patients. This has been postulated to be caused in part by lower peritonitis rates. However, the causes of admission have not been reexamined in the setting of declining rates. We prospectively examined our hospitalization rates, causes of admission, and impact of peritonitis on hospitalization in adult PD patients at a single center over a 4-year period. There were 274 admissions in 168 patient-years for a rate of 1.6 admissions and 13.0 hospital days per patient-year. Rates were greater for men (1.8 v 1.5; P = 0.013), patients with diabetes (2.2 v 1.4, P < 0.001), and those with a higher peritoneal equilibration test result. Creatinine clearance and sex were independent predictors in a multivariate analysis. The most common causes for admission were cardiac disease (14.6%) and peritonitis (13.5%). Peritonitis accounted for 0.21 admissions and 2.0 hospital days per patient-year. Thirty percent of the incident patients were admitted during the first 90 days of dialysis. Admissions for dehydration and glucose abnormalities were more common in the first 90 days. Overall admission rates, as well as admission rates for peritonitis, did not change over time, although hospital days per year decreased. Those admitted for peritonitis had higher peritonitis rates, more time on PD, and were more likely to be black. Eighty-one percent of the admissions for peritonitis were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp, or gram-negative/fungal peritonitis. Patients with peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis were less likely to be admitted than patients with peritonitis caused by other organisms. To conclude, peritonitis remains a common cause of hospitalization, despite low peritonitis rates. To decrease admissions for peritonitis, attention should be focused on preventing peritonitis caused by organisms other than S epidermidis.
TI  - Increased levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients on CAPD: a study during non-infected steady state and peritonitis.
AB  - Long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. TGF-beta1 and bFGF were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with CAPD and at 5 months. To determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. Serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. TGF-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (P<0.05). No change in bFGF was seen during this initial 5 months. TGF-beta1 was increased on the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (P<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). Basic FGF reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; P=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 is influenced by CAPD treatment per se, and together with bFGF is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common Gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in Taiwan were determined by the agar dilution method. The tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of E. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC50 and MIC90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for both MRSA and MSSA; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.5 microgram/mL for MRSE; 0.25 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for MSSE; 0.125 microgram/mL and 0.125 microgram/mL for S. pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/mL and 0.25 microgram/mL for S. pneumoniae. Eighty-two percent of the tested E. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an MIC50 of 2 micrograms/mL and an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/mL. Quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common Gram-positive bacteria other than E. faecalis in Taiwan.
TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis. Report of 7 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We report on 7 patients with pacemaker endocarditis diagnosed during the workup of long-standing fever. Persistent positive blood cultures and echocardiography led to the diagnosis in 6 patients whereas autopsy was diagnostic in another. Causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Streptococcus bovis (1), and Streptococcus mitis-Streptococcus sanguis (1). Pulmonary embolism was present in nearly 50% of the cases, a figure clearly higher than previously reported. In all but 1 case the initial medical approach was not successful, and thus the pacing system was finally removed. None of the cases relapsed after the removal. We have reviewed the literature regarding pacemaker endocarditis, particularly with respect to treatment.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - Etiology of septic arthritis in children: an update for the 1990s.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the etiology of septic arthritis in children after implementation of HIB immunization guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective review of all charts with a discharge diagnosis of septic arthritis (ICD-9: 711) from January 1991 to December 1996 at St. Louis Children's Hospital was conducted. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (male = 58%) were identified, whose median age was 6.0 years. Twenty-one children (33%) were misdiagnosed on initial presentation. An organism was isolated in 38 (59%) of cases. The predominant organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (10 isolates), Group A Streptococcus (4), Enterobacter species (4), Kingella kingae (3), Neisseria meningitides (3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2), Candida (2), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2). The only isolate of Haemophilus influenzae type B was in 1992 in an unimmunized 14 month old. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm Staphylococcus aureus as a frequent pathogen and suggest that H influenzae type B is no longer the predominant isolate in young children with septic arthritis. In addition, early septic arthritis in children is frequently misdiagnosed on initial evaluation.
TI  - [Pott's puffy tumor].
AB  - A 26-year-old man developed a fluctuating swelling of the forehead after twice being treated with antibiotics because of persistent sinusitis complaints. This swelling, a subperiostal abcess diagnosed as 'Pott's puffy tumor', is a complication of a frontal sinusitis, and may lead to serious neurological sequelae. The patient recovered after surgical drainage, ethmoidectomy and intravenous antibiotic treatment; no ablation of affected bone was necessary.
TI  - [Prevention of contamination with a heat-and-moisture-exchanger (HME) and bacterial filter during clinical anesthesia].
AB  - Although the use of HME and bacterial filter is a common practice to protect the  anesthesia machine as well as the patients from bacterial contaminants, there is no report demonstrating the effectiveness of this filter in clinical anesthesia setting. We evaluated the actual effectiveness of the filter during clinical use. While the anesthesia breathing circuit, two bacterial filters (BB 50 T, Nihon PALL) and anesthesia bag, which were sterilized with ethylen oxide gas (EOG), were connected to the anesthesia machine and used continuously for one week, EOG sterilized HME and bacterial filter (BB 25 A, Nihon PALL) were changed before each anesthesia. Culture samples were taken from the BB 25 A, the breathing circuit and the machine side of the BB 50 T. Of the 117 BB 25 A samples taken, 6 were positive for Micrococcus, alpha-Streptococcus, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From 21 breathing circuit "internal" samples, one was positive for Bacillus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. But the contamination from outside sources was suspected, since all the BB 25 as used with this circuit were negative. Use of BB 25 A prevents contamination of the breathing circuit for a period of one week. If we use BB 25 A in every anesthesia case, the changing of the breathing circuit is unnecessary, reducing the cost and simplifying procedures during clinical practice.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Bacteriology of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - The bacteriology of chronic sinusitis was studied by using swab and mucosal specimens from both the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. The specimens of the maxillary sinus were taken through translabial antroscopy. The specimens of the ethmoid sinus were taken after removing the ethmoid bulla during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Eighty-six samples of each type of specimen were collected. Among the maxillary sinus samples, the culture rate was 60.5 per cent from the swab specimens and 36 per cent from the mucosal specimens. Among the ethmoid sinus samples, the culture rate was 58.1 per cent from the swab specimens and 75.6 per cent from the mucosal. The p-value by the Chi-Square test is higher than 0.01 (p = 0.015). As there were more isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis from the mucosal specimens, they are not a better choice of specimen for sampling the ethmoid sinus than a swab specimen.
TI  - Purification and properties of a bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. Its molecular mass was 3500 Da and pI was 10.5. This bacteriocin inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis, but Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. The mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
TI  - Microbiological examinations and in-vitro testing of different antibiotics in therapeutic endoscopy of the biliary system.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. Because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. In addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (PTCD) were included. Sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. Bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary drainage. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. In the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. RESULTS: The incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. Twelve different microorganisms were detected, with Escherichia coli found in four cases. From 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. A single agent was detected in eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). The seven most frequently isolated germs were E. coli and Enterococcus (each n = 19), Klebsiella (n = 10), Streptococcus viridans (n = 9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Morganella morganii (n = 4), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. Examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of Candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). Interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), with a consequent rise in the gastric pH value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on PPIs (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). In-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. Imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. Enterococci, Klebsiella and Streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. In view of the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.
TI  - Passive deformability of mature, immature, and active neutrophils in healthy and  septicemic neonates.
AB  - Obstruction of narrow vessels by rigid neutrophils may contribute to ischemic organ injury. In septicemia, a substantial portion of the neutrophils may become activated and the number of circulating immature neutrophils may rise sharply. Volume and deformability of mature (PMN) and immature neutrophils in healthy preterm and full-term infants and in septicemic neonates were studied by means of a micropipette system. Membrane cytoplasm tongues were aspirated into 2.5-microm (diameter) pipettes over a period of 60 s. Volume and tongue growth of mature resting PMN were similar in healthy preterm and full-term neonates and adults. Compared with mature PMN (about 360 fl), the volumes of band cells (415 fl), metamyelocytes (470 fl), and less mature cells (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; 490 fl) were significantly increased (p < 0.005). Final tongue lengths of band cells, metamyelocytes, and less mature cells were decreased by about 50, 60, and 70%, respectively, when compared with passive mature cells. In septic neonates, the percentage of immature neutrophils was increased, but the deformability and volume of the cell subpopulations were not affected by septicemia. Active PMN were characterized by pseudopod formation. More active PMN were found in group B streptococcal (14% of total PMN), gram-negative (12%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia (8%) than in healthy neonates and adults (4%). The main bodies of active PMN were less deformable than passive PMN, and the pseudopods showed very little membrane deformation. The increased number of rigid active and immature neutrophils may contribute to impaired microcirculation and the high risk for organ injury in septic patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - Effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (NO) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. We studied the antimicrobial properties of NO in concentrations used with inhaled NO therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. DESIGN: In vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without NO exposure. SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. SUBJECTS: In vitro bacterial cultures. INTERVENTIONS: We tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococcus [GBS/Streptococcus agalactiae], Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. Cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of NO (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. After incubation (with or without NO), colony-forming units were counted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was not reduced with the NO concentrations applied. The number of colony-forming units of S. aureus increased at 80 ppm of NO. Growth of S. epidermidis and GBS was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. However, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled NO in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of NO is not to be expected.
TI  - [Gram-positive cocci isolated from blood].
AB  - Between 1994 and 1997, the main organisms isolated from the blood of patients examined in our laboratory were staphylococci. Namely 216 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 194 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 81 strains of other coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from patient blood. Regarding S. aureus, MRSA strains were predominant and 140 strains of MRSA were isolated from patient blood. S. epidermidis and MRSA were mainly isolated from patients will indwelling intravenous catheters. In some cases showing positive culture of S. epidermidis, however, the probability of contamination while taking the blood samples could not be excluded. A survey of infective endocarditis between April 1987 and March 1997 revealed that the main causative organism of native valve endocarditis was still streptococci. Of 33 cases of native valve endocarditis, 18 cases were due to viridans streptococci.
TI  - Study of common aerobic flora of human cerumen.
AB  - Cerumen is the product of the secretion of the sebaceous, ceruminous or apocrine  glands together with cells exfoliated from the cornified stratum of the epithelium of the external auditory canal (EAC). In the present study we identified and quantified common flora of human cerumen. The mean count obtained was 10(6) microorganisms per ml of cerumen suspension. In 24 pools of cerumen (33.3 per cent) the isolates were monomicrobial, Staphylococcus epidermidis (12), Corynebacterium spp (10), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus saprophyticum (1). In 48 pools (66.6 per cent) we found polymicrobial isolates. The most commonly isolated bacteria in these polymicrobial isolates were S. epidermidis (35) and Corynebacterium spp. (43). It is noteworthy that there were isolates of Candida albicans in three cases; in one case of Pseudomonas stutzeri, in one case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and, on seven occasions, of S. aureus. The organisms isolated as common bacterial components of human cerumen in our experience were similar to those found by other authors. However, the mean count was much higher. This could be related to climatic conditions and to the length of time the cerumen had remained in the external auditory canal.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - Detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16S rRNA gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. The use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. One hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), Streptococcus mitis (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). Eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected bacterial DNA in nine of 11 blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for PCR; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the conventional identification of the cultured isolates. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures, 18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. The species presumptively identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing were as follows: Pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), Acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); Escherichia spp. (n = 3); Moraxella spp. (n = 3); Staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); Neisseria spp. (n = 1); and Bacillus spp. (n = 1). The results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.
TI  - Direct-exchange arthroplasty for the treatment of infection after total hip replacement. An average ten-year follow-up.
AB  - Twenty consecutive patients who had a direct-exchange total hip arthroplasty, performed by one surgeon between October 1979 and July 1990, were prospectively followed and data were collected. The most common infecting organism was Staphylococcus epidermidis (nine patients), followed by Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus (five patients each). Three patients (15 per cent) had a draining sinus tract at the time of the operation. The operation and the postoperative management included meticulous debridement, administration of appropriate systemic antibiotic therapy, and use of antibiotic-loaded cement. By an average of 9.9 years (range, 3.5 to 17.1 years) postoperatively, no patient had had recurrence of the infection. Two patients had a revision for aseptic loosening nine and seventeen years after the direct exchange. Although the present series is relatively small, our experience has shown that direct exchange, which is associated with less morbidity and is less expensive than delayed exchange, can be successful in carefully selected patients.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a 32-kilodalton lipoprotein component of a novel iron-regulated Staphylococcus epidermidis ABC transporter.
AB  - Our previous studies identified two iron-regulated cytoplasmic membrane proteins  of 32 and 36 kDa expressed by both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. In this study we show by Triton X-114 phase partitioning and tritiated palmitic acid labelling that these proteins are lipoproteins which are anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane by their lipid-modified N termini. In common with those of some other gram-positive bacteria, these highly immunogenic lipoproteins were released from the bacterial cell into the culture supernatants, with release being promoted by growth of the bacteria under iron-restricted conditions. Immunoelectron microscopy with a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the 32-kDa S. epidermidis lipoprotein showed that the majority of the antigen was distributed throughout the staphylococcal cell wall. Only minor quantities were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane, and exposure of the lipoprotein on the bacterial surface was minimal. A monoclonal antibody raised to the 32-kDa lipoprotein of S. aureus was used in immunoblotting studies to investigate the conservation of this antigen among a variety of staphylococci. The monoclonal antibody reacted with polypeptides of 32 kDa in S. epidermidis and S. aureus and of 40 kDa in Staphylococcus hominis. No reactivity was detected with Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus cohni, or Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The gene encoding the 32-kDa lipoprotein from S. epidermidis has been isolated from a Lambda Zap II genomic DNA library and found to be a component of an iron-regulated operon encoding a novel ABC-type transporter. The operon contains three genes, designated sitA, -B, and -C, encoding an ATPase, a cytoplasmic membrane protein, and the 32-kDa lipoprotein, respectively. SitC shows significant homology both with a number of bacterial adhesins, including FimA of Streptococcus parasanguis and ScaA of Streptococcus gordonii, and with lipoproteins of a recently described family of ABC transporters with proven or putative metal ion transport functions. Although the solute specificity of this novel transporter has not yet been determined, we speculate that it may be involved in either siderophore- or transferrin-mediated iron uptake in S. epidermidis.
TI  - Management of animal bite injuries of the face: experience with 94 patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: Because of the large number of bacteria in the oral cavity, animal bite  wounds are generally contaminated, and their treatment is difficult because of the risk of infection, especially in extensive injuries. This report describes the management of a large series of patients and recommends treatment guidelines on the basis of the results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-four animal bite wounds on the face and head were analyzed according to the type of animal, location and extent of the soft tissue wound, duration and type of surgical treatment, occurrence of infections and their pathogen spectrum, as well as the choice of antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Dogs caused 91% of the bite wounds. Infections developed in 4 of 53 patients who underwent primary wound closure with minor edge excision and prophylactic administration of oral penicillin. Without antibiotic administration, 2 of 15 patients had infections, which were treated on an outpatient basis. Of 26 patients with initially delayed treatment, 18 showed clinical inflammatory symptoms with a wide spectrum of pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus) on presentation. CONCLUSION: Extensive animal bite wounds on the face, even with soft tissue defects, should be treated according to the criteria of a esthetic reconstructive facial surgery. In view of the low infection rate, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not justified.
TI  - Mucin gene (MUC 2 and MUC 5AC) upregulation by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. In partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the Gram-negative organism Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the MUC 2 mucin gene [J.-D. Li, A. Dohrman, M. Gallup, S. Miyata, J. Gum, Y. Kim, J. Nadel, A. Prince, C. Basbaum, Transcriptional activation of mucin by P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94 (1997) 967-972]. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin genes other than MUC 2 are so regulated and whether Gram-positive organisms also contain mucin stimulatory activity. Results from in situ hybridization and RNase protection assays showed that P. aeruginosa upregulates MUC 5AC as well as MUC 2 in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. The upregulation of both genes by P. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. In addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. These data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analysis of mutacin 1140, a lantibiotic from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans JH1000 and its derivatives were previously shown (J. D. Hillman, K. P. Johnson, and B. I. Yaphe, Infect. Immun. 44:141-144, 1984) to produce a low-molecular-weight, broad-spectrum bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS). The thermosensitive vector pTV1-OK harboring Tn917 was used to isolate a BLIS-deficient mutant, DM25, and the mutated gene was recovered by shotgun cloning in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of insert DNA adjacent to Tn917 led to the identification of four open reading frames including two (lanA and lanB) which have substantial homology to the Staphylococcus epidermidis structural gene (epiA) and a modifying enzyme gene (epiB) for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, respectively. Although the BLIS activity could not be recovered from broth cultures, high yields were obtained from a solid medium consisting of Todd-Hewitt broth containing 0.5% agarose that was stab inoculated with JH1140 (a spontaneous mutant of JH1000 that produces threefold-elevated amounts of activity). Agar could not substitute for agarose. Chloroform extraction of the spent medium produced a fraction which yielded two major bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The faster-migrating band was absent in chloroform extracts of the mutant, DM25. The amino acid sequence of this band was determined by Edman sequencing and mass spectroscopy. The results showed that it is a lantibiotic, which we have named mutacin 1140, and that the sequence corresponded to that deduced from the lanA sequence. We observed a number of similarities of mutacin 1140 to epidermin and an S. mutans lantibiotic, B-Ny266, but it appears to have significant differences in the positions of its thioether bridges. It also has other unique features with regard to its leader sequence and posttranslational modification. A proposed structure for mutacin 1140 is presented.
TI  - [Bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with or without therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) from August to December 1994 were analyzed. The search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. Two blood samples were collected before the ERCP and 4 of them after. The bottles used for cultures were Bactec bottles. The bottles were incubated in the Bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoScan/Microscan system. RESULTS: All blood cultures obtained before the ERCPs were negatives. Bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. In two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (Staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. The other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified were: Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiello oxytoca and Enterobacter aerogenes. This episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ERCPs (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). Clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected. CONCLUSION: The episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - Regulation of chemokine gene expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils phagocytosing microbial pathogens.
AB  - Production of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) by neutrophils is likely to be important in the regulation of inflammation and the control of infection. In this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to various microbial pathogens leads to the production of both macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and IL-8. The bacterial microbes, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus all strongly induced both IL-8 and MIP-1alpha secretion, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans were less potent. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymosan both induced IL-8 secretion but failed to stimulate that of MIP-1alpha. Coincubation of neutrophils with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the micro-organisms also led to differential expression of MIP-1alpha and IL-8. Significant enhancement of the induction of both MIP-1alpha and IL-8 by S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae as well as by C. albicans was observed. In contrast, while IL-8 production in response to S. cerevisiae and zymosan was enhanced in the presence of TNF-alpha, no MIP-1alpha was produced. These combined results indicate that while neutrophils exposed to some micro-organisms alone or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha will produce both MIP-1alpha and IL-8, resulting in generation of signals for the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes and neutrophils, respectively, certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward synthesis of IL-8.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Results of 2-stage reimplantation for infected total knee arthroplasty.
AB  - Optimum treatment of the infected total knee arthroplasty has not been clearly established. To clarify the efficacy of two-stage reimplantation, experience with 66 infected total knee arthroplasties in 64 patients who had been treated with 2-stage reimplantation total knee arthroplasty between September 1980 and October 1993 was reviewed. Of these, 55 knees in 54 patients were available for follow-up examinations at an average of 61.9 months (range, 28-146 months). The initial diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (14 knees) and osteoarthritis (41 knees). Reimplantation was successful in 80.0% of knees with low-virulence organisms (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus), 71.4% with polymicrobial organisms, and 66.7% with high-virulence organisms (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Reimplantation was successful in 82% of patients with osteoarthritis and in 54% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (P = .024). The success rate was 92% if infection occurred after primary arthroplasty but only 41% if after multiple previous knee operations (arthroscopy, osteotomy, or revision total knee arthroplasty) (P < .001).
TI  - [Genotyping of isolates of bacteria and Candida].
AB  - Strain differentiation of Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. REA of 19 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. Fifty-three isolates of S. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of REA pattern. REA patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those from different Staphylococcus species. A total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 S. pneumoniae isolates. There was some correlation between the REA patterns and serotypes. In addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. Sixteen isolates of E. coli O157 and 18 isolates of E. coli O25 were analyzed by REA with HaeIII. Among 14 epidemiologically unrelated E. coli O157:H7 isolates, REA patterns were either identical or differed only by a few fragment bands. REA patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing E. coli O25 from an outbreak were identical. Eight distinct REA patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic C. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. Candida strains belonging to different six Candida species were analysed by REA. All C. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains were divided into 37 groups according to the REA patterns. Each Candida strain showed species-specific REA patterns. Twenty-one isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by PCR with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of IS6110(IS6110-PCR). The results of PCR of 19 M. tuberculosis isolates and 2 M. bovis BCG isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. Our results demonstrated that REA of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII was a useful tool for strain differentiation. By comparing the species-specific REA patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of Candida and Staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. Because IS6110-PCR is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate M. tuberculosis strains.
TI  - Occurrence of peptidyl D-amino acids in soluble fractions of several eubacteria,  archaea and eukaryotes.
AB  - The occurrence of peptidyl D-amino acids in the aqueous soluble fractions was investigated in various eubacteria, some archaea and some eukaryotes. The contents of the D-enantiomers of serine, alanine, proline, glutamate (glutamine), aspartate (asparagine) and phenylalanine were determined with cell- and tissue-extracts, by means of acid hydrolysis and high-performance liquid chromatography. The rate of D-enantiomer (%, the ratio in molar concentration of a D-amino acid to the total of the D-amino acid and the corresponding L-amino acid) of alanine and glutamate were high in some Gram-positive eubacteria: 11.7% in Staphylococcus epidermidis and 10.3% in Streptococcus pyogenes for alanine, and 22.3% for glutamate in Bacillus YN-1. The D-glutamate content was also high (8.0%) in the Gram-negative eubacterium, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. D-Aspartate was common, as was D-glutamate: the highest D-aspartate content was detected in an archaeum, Pyrobaculum islandicum (4.0%). However, the content of D-aspartate was low, 0.2-1.8% in most other bacteria. The presence of D-serine was shown in some organisms, but that of D-proline was scarce. The D-enantiomer of phenylalanine was not detected in any of the organisms examined. These results indicate that of the bacteria examined herein most Gram-negative and some Gram-positive eubacteria, as well as archaea contain only low levels of D-amino acids in the soluble peptidyl fraction, and the levels were comparable to those in eukaryotes examined. To our knowledge, the general presence of peptidyl D-amino acids in these organisms, especially archaea and eukaryotic cells including those from rat liver tissues, has been shown here for the first time.
TI  - Abiotrophia elegans sp. nov., a possible pathogen in patients with culture-negative endocarditis.
AB  - We isolated a hitherto undescribed microorganism from a patient with endocarditis. The microscopic appearance, a negative catalase reaction, and growth as satellite colonies next to Staphylococcus epidermidis suggested that this microorganism is a member of the genus Abiotrophia, formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococci. However, the clinical isolate described herein differed markedly from the known Abiotrophia spp., A. adiacens and A. defectiva, in terms of its (i) biochemical properties, (ii) restricted growth temperature range, (iii) whole-cell lysate polypeptide profile, and (iv) unique nutritional requirements. In contrast to the type strains of A. adiacens and A. defectiva, which used L-cysteine and pyridoxal hydrochloride as growth factors, the growth of the clinical isolate was only supported by L-cysteine hydrochloride and not by pyridoxal hydrochloride when the organism was tested in Todd-Hewitt or casein-soy peptone broth. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the microorganism was a member of the genus Abiotrophia and was most closely related to A. adiacens (96.9% homology). Phenotypic and phylogenetic data are consistent with the assumption of a new species within the genus Abiotrophia, for which we propose the name Abiotrophia elegans sp. nov. The unique nutritional requirements of this strain are of importance for diagnostic laboratories. The media of blood culture systems supplemented only with pyridoxal hydrochloride as a growth factor may fail to promote the growth of A. elegans sp. nov., and thus, these systems might not detect this microorganism as a possible cause of endocarditis.
TI  - Detection of erythromycin resistant methylase gene by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed that could specifically  amplify a 520-bp region of the erythromycin resistant methylase (ermC) gene sequence. The identity of the PCR-amplified 520-bp DNA was confirmed by HinCII endonuclease restriction digestion, which produced the predicted 440-bp and 80-bp DNA fragments. A 20-mer (alpha-32P) oligonucleotide probe specifically hybridized with these amplified products confirming the specificity and reliability of this diagnostic assay. The assay could detect the ermC gene in bacterial suspensions containing as few as 10(3) cells ml-1. The assay was used to detect the presence of the ermC gene in several Gram-positive bacterial strains identified as Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterococcus sp., isolated from water samples maintained in experimental animal cages and clinical sources. Only bacteria identified as Staphylococcus sp. were resistant to the antibiotic. Although 17 strains of Staphylococcus sp. isolated from clinical samples were resistant to erythromycin, only seven of these isolates tested positive for the presence of the ermC gene. Of these strains, five were identified as coagulase-positive S. aureus and the rest were identified as coagulase-negative S. epidermidis. The erythromycin resistance in all seven ermC positive isolates was constitutive. The entire diagnostic assay, including template preparation, amplification and electrophoresis can be completed within 6 h.
TI  - Role of monocytes and bacteria in Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis.
AB  - The endocardial vegetation which is formed in the course of bacterial endocarditis (BE) contains tissue factor (TF)-dependent procoagulant activity. Earlier studies showed that monocytes are the main source of TF in the vegetations. The TF activity (TFA) of vegetations isolated from Streptococcus sanguis-infected rabbits depended on the numbers of bacteria as well as monocytes in the vegetation. In this study, we investigated whether for Staphylococcus epidermidis, a frequent pathogen in BE, an effect similar to that found for S. sanguis could be shown. In vitro, S. epidermidis was found to stimulate TFA of fibrin adherent monocytes significantly. This stimulation was maximal at a bacterium-to-monocyte ratio of 7. In vivo, TFA was found to be significantly higher in S. epidermidis-infected than in sterile catheter-induced vegetations. Reduction of vegetational bacterial numbers by teicoplanin treatment lead to a small but significant decrease of TFA. Reduction of monocyte numbers by etoposide did not affect vegetational TFA. Comparison of data for S. epidermidis and S. sanguis revealed that at equivalent bacterial numbers, vegetational TFAs were approximately the same for both microorganisms. Combining the results of the present study with those of a previous study using S. sanguis, we conclude that the main factor determining monocyte-dependent vegetational TFA is the number of vegetation-associated bacteria. The lower TFA found for S. epidermidis-infected than for S. sanguis-infected vegetations can be explained by the significantly lower bacterial numbers in the infected vegetations and consequently a lower stimulation of vegetation-associated monocytes.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis after ampicillin therapy.
AB  - The bacteriologies of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were studied in 74 chronic sinusitis patients who took ampicillin (500 mg every 6 hours) for 2 weeks preoperatively. The specimens from one ipsilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were obtained when undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery. In 74 specimens of the maxillary sinus, 38 bacterial isolates were recovered. The culture rate was 46.0%. On the other hand, 34 bacterial isolates were taken from the ethmoid sinus specimens. The culture rate was 41.9%. As compared with a previous group who did not take any antibiotic preoperatively, the culture rate significantly decreased in the maxillary as well as the ethmoid sinus specimens. Not surprisingly, a significantly decreased sensitivity to ampicillin was also found in the recovered bacteria from both the maxillary sinus (23.7%) and ethmoid sinus (5.9%) specimens. These results demonstrate that antibiotic therapy with ampicillin could eradicate most sensitive bacteria in chronic sinusitis. However, persistence of resistant bacteria was demonstrated.
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - Identification of staphylococcal and streptococcal causes of bovine mastitis using 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions.
AB  - Bovine mastitis is caused mainly by certain Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. The sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions were determined for the nine species which cause mastitis: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus xylosus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. Significant variation was found between the spacer sequences of different species with the lengths of the spacers varying from 240 to 461 bp. Between genera the spacers shared only short conserved regions (8-9 bp) and within genera the sequence identities varied from 53 to 85%. This variation made it possible to construct specific primer pairs for these species and genera. The specificities of these primers were tested with 25 bacterial species and 51 isolates from cattle with clinical mastitis. The DNA-based identification of the mastitis species was mostly successful.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of LY333328, a new semisynthetic glycopeptide.
AB  - LY333328 is a semisynthetic N-alkyl derivative of LY264826, a naturally occurring structural analog of vancomycin. LY333328 was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities in comparison with those of the two currently available glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). Glycopeptide-susceptible test strains included a total of 311 isolates (most of clinical origin) from the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, Gemella, Lactococcus, Listeria, Corynebacterium, and Clostridium. Test strains resistant or intermediate to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin included 56 clinical isolates of Enterococcus (of the VanA, VanB, and VanC phenotypes) and 32 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus (S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus), 31 strains of gram-positive genera outside the spectrum of activity of vancomycin (Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, and Erysipelothrix), and laboratory-derived organisms obtained after exposure of susceptible Staphylococcus isolates to teicoplanin (6 strains) or laboratory-derived organisms with resistance determinants received from VanA enterococci (2 Enterococcus and 25 Listeria transconjugants). LY333328 was highly active against staphylococci, enterococci, and listeriae (whether they were clinical or laboratory-derived strains) resistant to the currently available glycopeptides. In particular, the MICs of LY333328 did not vary substantially between teicoplanin-susceptible and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci and between vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. LY333328 demonstrated fairly good inhibitory activity even against most strains of Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and Erysipelothrix (MIC range, 1 to 8 microg/ml), whereas it proved less active (although much more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin) against Lactobacillus strains. In minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill studies, LY333328 demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity; enterococci, in particular, which were largely tolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin, were uniformly killed by LY333328, with MBC-to-MIC ratios of 4 to 8 for most vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains. In attempts to select for resistant clones, no survivors stably growing in the presence of 10 microg of LY333328 per ml were obtained from the Staphylococcus and Enterococcus test strains exposed to the drug.
TI  - Enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Model biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. Plaque-resembling biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. Glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. A complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have a significant bactericidal activity. Combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.
TI  - Use of the isolator 1.5 microbial tube for culture of synovial fluid from patients with septic arthritis.
AB  - Synovial fluid specimens obtained from patients with arthritis were plated onto solid media (conventional cultures) or inoculated into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube (Isolator cultures), and the yield and time to detection of organisms were compared. Overall, 144 specimens obtained from 137 patients were processed, and 31 (21.5%) cultures obtained from 29 patients were positive by at least one method. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 12 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Kingella kingae were isolated from 4 patients each, group G streptococci were isolated from 3 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2 patients each, and Streptococcus mitis and Peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from 1 patient each. Overall, the causative organism was detected in 31 of 31 (100.0%) Isolator cultures and 24 of 31 (77.4%) conventional cultures (P < 0.02). Twenty-nine of 31 (93.5%) positive Isolator cultures and 20 of 24 (83.3%) conventional cultures were positive by the second day of incubation. Among the 24 cultures positive by both methods, higher numbers of CFU per milliliter were detected with the Isolator system in 13 cultures and with conventional cultures in 2 cultures (P < 0.002). Inoculation of synovial fluid into an Isolator 1.5 microbial tube improves the recovery of organisms causing septic arthritis.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic Gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of Gram-positive bone infections, METHODS: Vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. The 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma levels between 25 and 35 mg/L. Mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. Sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). Sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were performed at the beginning of the treatment. Involved bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), S. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), Enterococcus faecalis (one), Enterococcus avium (one) and Streptococcus bovis (one). RESULTS: MIC of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L. The mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/L. Based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). Failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). Adverse events included pruritus (four cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and transient neutropenia (two). Vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of Gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material removal are performed.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151 consecutive CSF bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. Treatment decisions associated with individual CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. Treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial therapy based on the reporting of CSF culture isolates. Thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. Three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from 34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (Candida tropicalis, Proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second CSF specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. Thus, only a single isolate (3%; Staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. In contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; Cryptococcus neoformans, 10; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; Streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). We conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from CSF specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of CSF broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - The purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (RXM). We measured the MICs of macrolide antibiotics, such as RXM, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), rokitamycin (RKM) and midecamycin (MDM), and other classes of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between October and December in 1994 and 1995. RXM had excellent antibacterial activities for S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Against methicillin sensitive S. epidermidis, RXM activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had MIC > or = 128 micrograms/ml. The activity against S. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of EM, CAM, MDM, and clindamycin. The vast majority of methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. In conclusion, RXM is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus except MRSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis and M. pneumoniae.

TI  - Bacterial colonization of pacifiers of infants with acute otitis media.
AB  - The presence of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria on the surface of pacifiers used by children with acute otitis media was investigated. The surface of 40 recently used pacifiers was swabbed after they were allowed to dry for five to six minutes. The swabs were processed quantitatively for the presence of aerobic bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the pacifier material was tested in vitro. Microorganisms were isolated from 21 (52.5 per cent) pacifiers. The number of colonies per pacifier varied between one and 35 (average six). The isolates included eight alpha-haemolytic streptococci, six Staphylococcus epidermis, five Candida albicans, five alpha-haemolytic streptococci, three Neisseria spp. and two Staphylococcus aureus. The pacifier material was shown to be inhibitory against S. aureus. This study illustrated that pacifiers do not contain high numbers of organisms and therefore are not likely to serve as a source of persistence of transfer of organisms.
TI  - Contamination of diagnostic ophthalmic solutions in primary eye care settings.
AB  - Pharmaceutical agents and irrigating solutions are widely used in both optometric and ophthalmologic practices. Contamination of these containers or solutions could possibly pose some risk of infection to a patient. We set out to investigate the possible contamination of a representative sample of these containers in small office practices. Representative bottles of two diagnostic pharmaceutical agents and an irrigating solution were obtained from primary care optometric and ophthalmologic practices in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area. These bottles were tested to investigate the rate of contamination and to identify the types of microorganisms in the contaminated solutions. Sixty total samples (proparacaine, tropicamide, and an irrigating solution) were randomly cultured, and 11.7% of the samples showed contamination. Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas putida, and Streptococcus species were the predominant organisms isolated from the contaminated bottles. In addition, 17 of the original 60 containers were further cultured for investigation of the dried residue particles around the threads of the containers. Of these 17 containers, 13 (76.5%) tested positive for Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species.
TI  - Comparison of the indigenous oral microbiota and immunoglobulin responses of athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice.
AB  - The role of the immune system in the homeostasis of indigenous oral bacterial populations is poorly understood. In this study, we compared the evolution of the indigenous oral microbiota of specific pathogen-free athymic nude (nu/nu) BALB/c mice with that of their corresponding phenotypically normal (nu/-) littermates. We also evaluated corresponding salivary and serum antibody activities (IgA and IgG) against the predominant indigenous oral bacteria. The bacterial species recovered from the two mouse strains were Lactobacillus murinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus oralis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From 27 days of age, nu/+ and nu/nu mice had significantly different proportions of oral bacterial populations. When the microbiota stabilized (at 40 days of age), the total cultivable microbiota of nu/+ mice was dominated by L. murinus (65-85%), while that of nu/nu mice was dominated by E. faecalis (40-60%). The precise factors that alter the oral resident microbiota in nu/nu mice are unknown. We found that total salivary IgA levels were significantly lower in nu/nu mice, but no association were observed between the level of salivary IgA antibody against indigenous bacteria and the proportion of these indigenous bacteria in the oral microbiota. The change in the microbiota of nude mice may have been caused by other factors such as defects in other immune functions or cold stress.
TI  - Blebitis, early endophthalmitis, and late endophthalmitis after glaucoma-filtering surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: The differentiating characteristics in blebitis and early and late endophthalmitis after glaucoma filtration surgery are reviewed. METHODS: All admission records and operative reports, as well as available office notes, on patients with blebitis or bleb-associated endophthalmitis admitted to a large referral eye center from 1985 to 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Ten cases of blebitis and 33 cases of bleb-associated endophthalmitis were identified. One patient with blebitis progressed to culture-positive endophthalmitis. Of the 33 cases of bleb-associated endophthalmitis, there were 6 cases of early endophthalmitis (before postoperative week 6) and 27 cases of late endophthalmitis. In early endophthalmitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated on vitreous culture in 4 (67%) of 6 cases, whereas in late endophthalmitis, this organism was isolated in only 1 (4%) of 27 cases. In the 27 late cases, Streptococcus species and gram-negative organisms comprised 48% of isolates; of 33 cases of endophthalmitis, 15 (45%) demonstrated no growth on vitreous culture. Patients with endophthalmitis fared more poorly than those with blebitis in terms of visual outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Because blebitis may be prodromal to endophthalmitis, aggressive antimicrobial therapy, perhaps with oral quinolones, is warranted. In addition, patients with blebitis should be observed closely to identify extension into the vitreous cavity so that intravitreous antibiotics can be administered in a timely fashion. Finally, clinicians should not extrapolate the results of the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study to the postfiltration surgery endophthalmitis given the differing pathogenesis and unique spectrum of organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. The in-vitro spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant Gram-positive aerobes, important Gram-negative aerobes, Gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. Of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. Bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. Overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat Gram-positive infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Since this activity extends to Gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.
TI  - [Infectious bursitis: study of 40 cases in the pre-patellar and olecranon regions].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Septic bursitis usually affects subcutaneous localized bursae such the prepatellar and elbow bursae. This condition is infrequently reported in the spanish medical literature. The aim of this report was to study patients suffering from septic bursitis with regard to predisposing conditions, the causative agents, therapy and clinical outcome. METHOD: A retrospective study was undertaken in patients with infectious bursitis attended in the Service of Rheumatology of the POVISA Medical Centre (Vigo) and Juan Canalejo Hospital (La Coruna), Spain, from january 1989 to january 1995. The diagnosis of septic bursitis was confirmed with positive bursal fluid cultures in all cases. RESULTS: We recovered forty cases of infectious bursitis (23 olecranon bursitis and 17 prepatellar bursitis). Most patients were male (80%), and patient mean age was 52 years (range: 14-94). The most common predisposing factors to bacterial infection were steroid therapy (15%) and alcoholism (8%), in addition to cutaneous lesions associated with occupational or recreational trauma (55%). Prepatellar septic bursitis was associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation with fever (71% vs 48%), leukocytosis (76% vs 52%), cellulitis (59% vs 48%) and positive blood cultures (25% vs 0%). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 87.5% of bursal fluid aspirations, the other etiologic microrganism were Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), Streptococcus agalactiae (2 cases) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 case). The majority of patients (80%) required initial intravenous therapy of which average duration was 11 days (range: 5-21 days). Successful resolution of septic bursitis without open surgical drainage was seen in 38 patients (95%) and there ware no functional impairment, serious complications or recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with septic bursitis suffered systemic and/or local predisposing illness. S. aureus is the commonest pathogen. Prepatellar septic bursitis is associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation and bacteremia. Usually, the prompt and proper antibiotic therapy make innecessary surgical drainage.

TI  - Epidemiology of infections in the adult medical intensive care unit of a cancer hospital.
AB  - A prospective collection of positive antimicrobial cultures was performed over 12 consecutive months in the medical intensive care unit of a cancer hospital. In all, 144 infections and 163 pathogens were documented during 87 of the 528 admissions. Lung, urinary, ENT (ear, nose and throat) infections and bacteraemia were the most frequently documented. Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas species were the most common pathogens. Gram-positive strains were observed predominantly during monomicrobial bacteraemia (48.9%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were found in 58% and 92% of the isolated strains respectively. No particular outbreak was identified. A further prospective study will be necessary to evaluate the impact of the antibiotic use on the selection of resistant strains in our ICU.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - This study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. The anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. Then, the sample of ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. Thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. Fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. The cultural rate was 60.9%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus viridans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae. Conversely, only three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. The results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus more accurate.
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - Identification and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from periapical lesions.
AB  - Periradicular tissues from 28 refractory endodontic cases requiring surgical intervention were submitted for histological diagnosis and microbiological culture. Bacteria isolated from these lesions were identified and then tested for their antibiotic sensitivity to a panel of common antibiotics. The periapical tissue specimens of 22 out of 28 lesions (79%) contained microorganisms. Of the 22 cases showing positive growth cultures, 15 were polymicrobial and 7 were single species isolates. Fifty-three different species were recovered: 29 anaerobes, 19 facultative anaerobes, and 5 aerobes. Microbes were observed under light microscopy in only one case. The most common organisms isolated were Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Wolinella recta, Fusobacterium species, and Clostridium species. Antibiotic susceptibility results showed no clear cut evidence of significant antibiotic resistance among the species tested. The results of this study seem to corroborate earlier studies regarding the microbial population of periapical lesions refractory to nonsurgical endodontics.
TI  - Prevalence and duration of intramammary infection in Danish heifers during the peripartum period.
AB  - Milk samples were collected from 180 heifers from 20 herds around parturition to  study the prevalence and persistence of intramammary infection (IMI). A total of 3382 quarter milk samples was collected each week from 4 wk before parturition to 4 wk after parturition. Staphylococcus chromogenes, the most commonly found bacterial species before parturition, was isolated from 15% of all quarters. However, IMI with Staph. chromogenes decreased shortly after parturition to around 1% of quarters. Infectious with Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in 1 to 3% of quarters both before and after parturition. Infections with Staph. simulans persisted in the same quarter for several weeks, but IMI with Staph. epidermidis were transient. Streptococcus dysgalactiae was isolated from 4 to 6% of quarters before and immediately after parturition, but the prevalence of IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae decreased. A strong association existed between IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae before parturition and IMI with Strep. dysgalactiae after parturition, and, using DNA typing, the persistence of 9 IMI was confirmed. Infections with Staphylococcus aureus rarely occurred before parturition, but the rate of IMI with Staph. aureus greatly increased during the 1st wk after parturition. No association was found between bacterial status before parturition and IMI with Staph. aureus after parturition. Overall, the presence of bacterial IMI in a quarter before parturition increased the risk of IMI for the lactating cow. This study demonstrated that variability in prevalence and duration of IMI according to bacterial species occurred around first parturition.
TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - The interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  - Liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (SA), dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (DCchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. Targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems DPPC-chol-SA, DPPC-DPPG and DPPC-PI liposomes to S. epidermidis. The effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for S. epidermidis biofilms. It was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. The delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide Triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. Superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for DPPC-chol-SA liposomes and for Triclosan delivery by DPPC-DPPG and DPPC-PI liposomes targeted to S. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. DPPC-chol-SA liposomes were also effective for delivery of Triclosan to S. sanguis biofilms. Double labelling experiments using [14C]-chlorhexidine and [3H]-DPPC suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. At the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees C. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. The highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours and 0800 hours, prior to operation. When applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). These mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. CONCLUSION: Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. This fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomanas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Two stages reimplantation for infection after knee arthroplasty. Apropos of a series of 29 cases].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this work was to precise diagnosis and treatment of infected total knee arthroplasty with two stage reimplantation. MATERIAL: 29 infected total knee arthroplasties were operated between 1984 and 1994 and included in this study (mean F.U. 3.5 Y). There were 20 females and 9 males, mean age 70 (46-83). The original arthroplasty was done for OA in 28 patients, RA in one. The arthroplasties were: UHK 2, Bicompartmental 2, Tricompartmental 19. 20 TKA were cementless. 14 patients showed one or several risk factors. Infection was diagnosed in 1 of 2 ways: preoperative aspiration or culture of surgical specimen. There were 12 staphylococcus epidermidis, 8 staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus (n = 2) acinetobacter (n = 2), peptococcus (n = 1) pseudomonas (n = 1), gemella morbidellum (n = 1). 6 were non identified. METHOD: The protocol for two stage reimplantation began with components and cement removal. A synovectomy was performed. The knee cavity was filled with antibiotic cement spacer and the wound was closed. The leg was placed in a splint. All patients underwend a continued antibiotic therapy, specific in 20 cases with isolated organisms. A total knee arthroplasty was performed, using a total posterior cruciate substituting prosthesis, 6 to 8 weeks after components removal (2-24). All patients received parenteral antibiotics after reimplantation for not less than 2 months (2-6). RESULTS: Infection was eradicated in 24 cases, 22 in one time, 2 bad second debridement. At last follow-up the average Hungerford score was 75.6/100, the average Knee society knee score was 80 and the average functional score was 70. Mean range of flexion was 95 degrees. 6 patients had recurrent infection and poor result. They underwent arthrodesis. 5 of the 6 patients had solid mature fusion at last follow-up. DISCUSSION: The results of two stage reimplantation for infected total knee replacement showed that this is the method of choice for infection treatment and acceptable function restoration. As other authors, we get a good success rate (82 per cent). Functional result was better with identified microorganisms, but we did not find any correlation with organisms type or infection length. Punction and bone scanning are of great help for diagnosis in difficult chronical cases. Organism identification is fundamental for infection duration. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent identified organism. New procedures using articulated cement spacer may improve functional results.
TI  - [Development of resistance to difuracil (PAP-49) in bacteria and its activity in  combination with other antibacterial drugs].
AB  - Possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or N-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(N'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (PAP-49) in Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. It was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. The most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. During the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (E.coli) or was even somewhat higher (S. aureus and Streptococcus sp.). After that a new increase of the resistance was observed. The most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in Streptococcus sp. and the least marked in Staphylococcus sp. and E.coli. Combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to S.epidermidis, S. pneumonase, E.coli and P.mirabilis. The most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.
TI  - Bacteriology of lacrimal duct obstruction in adults.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the current bacteriology of lacrimal duct obstruction (LDO) and to relate the bacteriological findings to the type of symptoms. METHODS: 127 samples were obtained from the lacrimal sac in 118 consecutive adult patients with LDO, including nine bilateral cases. RESULTS: Altogether, 156 isolates were recovered from the 127 samples cultured. Cultures were positive from 84% of the samples. Gram positive bacteria were isolated in 79 (62%) samples. The most frequently cultured bacterial species was Staphylococcus epidermidis, representing 27% of the isolates. Gram negative bacteria were recovered from 26 (20%) samples, and these bacteria were statistically significantly more common in cases with copious discharge than in cases with minor discharge (p = 0.000). Cases with simple stenosis of the lacrimal duct (SSLD) showed significantly less Streptococcus sp (p = 0.004) and Gram negative organisms (p = 0.004) than those with chronic dacryocystitis. CONCLUSION: The bacteriology of SSLD resembles that of normal conjunctival flora. Chronic dacryocystitis in adults is associated with an increased proportion of Gram negative bacteria which may be a reservoir for postoperative intraocular infection. They should also be taken into account in selecting antimicrobial prophylaxis in lacrimal drainage surgery.
TI  - Differentiation between bacterial species and sub-species by pyrolysis mass spectrometry of extracted DNA.
AB  - Whole cell samples from cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes were analysed by pyrolysis mass spectrometry and the results were compared with Py-MS-derived analyses of samples of DNA extracted from the same organisms. Py-MS analysis differentiated the four organisms in both circumstances. These results challenge previous assumptions that Py-MS is restricted to detecting phenotypic differences, although the basis for the differentiation of the DNA extracts has yet to be determined.
TI  - In-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Six isolates each of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. Tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/L. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51 at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (FBC index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. The corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven, 26, 52 and 58 respectively. Antagonism (FBC index > or = 4) was demonstrated for one strain to each combination at 24 h. There were no significant differences between FIC indices and FBC indices for each antibiotic combination. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by 5 h and 59 by 24 h. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. In conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. Antagonism was rarely seen. Both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.
TI  - The treatment of patients with infected implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment of patients with infected implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done of the cases of 21 patients treated for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator infection during an 11-year period. RESULTS: Of 723 cardioverter-defibrillator implantations (550 primary implants, 173 replacements), nine (1.2%) were complicated by early postoperative device-related infections. Late infections developed in two patients 19 and 22 months, respectively, after implantation. Ten other patients were transferred to our institution for treatment of cardioverter-defibrillator infection. The time from implantation to overt infection was 2.2 +/- 1.3 months, excluding the two late infections. The responsible organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6), Streptococcus hemolyticus (1), gram-negative bacteria (3), Candida albicans (1), and Corynebacterium (1). All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotic drugs. Total system removal was done in 15 patients and partial removal in 2; in 4, the cardioverter-defibrillator system was not explanted. There were no perioperative deaths. A new implantable cardioverter-defibrillator system was reimplanted in 7 patients after 2 to 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Ten patients were treated without reimplantation (2 arrhythmia operation, 8 antiarrhythmic drugs). Four patients (3 patients without explantation and 1 with partial system removal) were treated with maintenance long-term antibiotic therapy. During a mean follow-up of 21 +/- 2.8 months, no patient had clinical recurrence of infection. One patient treated with antiarrhythmic drugs without system reimplantation died suddenly. CONCLUSIONS: Infections that involve implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems can be safely managed by removing the entire system with reimplantation after intravenous antibiotic therapy. In selected patients in whom the risk for system explantation is high and anticipated life expectancy is short, long-term antibiotic therapy to suppress low-virulence infections may represent an acceptable alternative.
TI  - Infective endocarditis--a photo essay.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is a microbial affliction of the heart valves or endocardium. Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) may result from infection with low-virulence organisms such as Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus epidermidis, or partially treated infection. We report a case of SBE with neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in India and the United States.
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Changes in bacterial strains before and after cataract surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the rate of contamination of conjunctival smears and anterior chamber aspirates at the conclusion of cataract surgery, and the relation between the types of bacterial strain in the conjunctival sac and anterior chamber at the conclusion of surgery and in preoperative samples from the conjunctival sac of the same eye. METHODS: The bacterial strains in conjunctival smears 1 week preoperatively and in conjunctival smears and anterior chamber aspirates at the conclusion of surgery from 58 consecutive eyes of 48 patients were examined. The patients underwent cataract surgery by phacoemulsification and aspiration followed by intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. All surgeries were broadcast simultaneously by closed-circuit television to the patients' families who were in a separate waiting room. RESULTS: At the conclusion of surgery, six eyes (10.3%) were contaminated: one anterior chamber aspirate (1.7%) and five conjunctival smears (8.6%). Only two (33%) of the six contaminated eyes at the conclusion of surgery had the same bacterial strain as the preoperative conjunctival smears. CONCLUSION: The percentage of culture-positive anterior chamber aspirates at the conclusion of phacoemulsification surgery and intraocular lens implantation was only 1.7%, despite a concurrent televised broadcast accompanied by an intraoperative microphone-transmitted explanation by the surgeon. Sixty-seven percent of the bacterial strains at the conclusion of surgery did not match those found preoperatively in the same eye.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  - Siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. Several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. Overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). E. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-OH-N-OH-delta-N-acetyl-L-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). B. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine B and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. P. multocida and P. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. Individual siderophores did not promote S. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. The antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. Conjugate-resistant E. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
TI  - Novel mechanism of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The mechanism of macrolide resistance was examined in 73 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Two distinct resistance phenotypes were observed: high-level macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS) resistance and low-level macrolide resistance with lincosamide susceptibility. High-level MLS resistance was associated with the presence of ermAM. Strains with the low-level resistant phenotype (novel) were negative for ermA, ermC, ermAM, ereA, ereB and msrA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with gene-specific primers. Ribosomes isolated from novel strains bound the same amount of [14C]-erythromycin as ribosomes from sensitive strains. These novel strains also did not inactivate the macrolide. The novel mechanism was found in 41% of the erythromycin resistant S. pneumoniae examined.
TI  - Treatment of endocarditis with teicoplanin: a retrospective analysis of 104 cases.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease but retains a high mortality. Glycopeptides are used for patients with resistant pathogens, those allergic to penicillins or for those outside the hospital. The once daily administration of teicoplanin and its low toxicity suggest that it would be suitable for use in the long courses required for endocarditis. However, the dosage and combinations to be used require further study. A retrospective review has been made of 104 episodes of endocarditis treated with teicoplanin in 101 patients seen over 7 years. Most patients had been referred to major London hospitals following failure of medical treatment. After three loading doses of 400 mg, teicoplanin was given at a dose of 400 mg/day in combination with other antibiotics such as gentamicin. Follow up was for one year. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus sanguis (15 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (13 cases) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10 cases). Of 80 patients febrile at the start of treatment with teicoplanin, 63 (79%) lost their fever within a median of 2 days (1-35 days). Cure without surgery was effected in 50 (48%) and 75% of patients survived. Other antibiotics, usually gentamicin or rifampicin, were used in 92 (90%) of patients. Two strains of Streptococcus spp. were said to be resistant but there was no relationship between MIC of teicoplanin and outcome. Pathogens with a high MBC tended to be more likely to resist treatment. Adverse effects resulted in the withdrawal of teicoplanin in 20 cases (19%) but most events were mild and renal deterioration occurred in only five patients. Teicoplanin was effective in the treatment of endocarditis and appeared to be safe given the severity of disease in the patients treated.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  - Infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA,  and Candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. We enumerated MRSA and C. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. Staphylococcus species, MRSA, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSE, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. C. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. All saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried Staphylococcus species and C. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. Adherence of isolated 3H labeled cells of MRSA and C. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. Cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. The hydrophobicity of the MRSA isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of C. albicans strains was moderately high. The zeta potentials of MRSA isolates and of C. albicans isolates determined in KCI buffer were significantly low. The potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. Two out of 5 MRSA strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of Staphylococcus species. No isolates of C. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the oral bacteria tested. Isolates of MRSA and C. albicans coaggregated with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum strains. Using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of Staphylococcus species or C. albicans organisms in saliva.
TI  - Volume of blood required to detect common neonatal pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum volume of blood and the absolute number of organisms required for detection of bacteremia and fungemia by an automated colorimetric blood culture system (BacT/Alert, Organon Teknika). DESIGN: Common neonatal pathogens, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus (GBS): one American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain and one clinical isolate), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans, were seeded into blood to produce bacteremia or fungemia with low colony counts (1 to 3 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter) and ultra-low colony counts (<1 CFU/ml). For each organism, 96 culture bottles were inoculated with either 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 ml of the two seeded blood concentrations. Blood culture bottles were incubated in the BacT/Alert device for 5 days, and time to positivity was noted when applicable. All bottles were subcultured on plated media. DATA ANALYSIS: The Poisson statistic was used to calculate the probability of finding at least one viable CFU per inoculated culture bottle. The fraction of culture bottles with positive findings per group was divided by the probability of one or more organisms present to give the positivity index. RESULTS: Plated subculture identified no growth of organisms not detected by the colorimetric detection system. The false-positive rate for the automated device was less than 1%. The positivity index for the GBS clinical isolate was 1.13, for the GBS ATCC isolate 0.96, for S. epidermidis 0.94, for C. albicans 0.97, and for E. coli 0.95. There was a statistically significant difference with time to positivity and inocula volume (p <0.01), but the difference was not clinically important. CONCLUSIONS: If one or two viable colony-forming units are in the blood inoculated into culture media, the BacT/Alert system will detect growth rapidly. Because there appears to be a sizable subset of neonates who are at risk of sepsis with a colony count less than 4 CFU/ml, then a 0.5 ml inoculum of blood into the culture media is inadequate for sensitive and timely detection of bacteremia. One to two milliliters of blood should increase microorganism recovery in the face of low-colony-count sepsis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility testing of 446 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria to new quinolones, carbapenems and cephalosporins].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the in vitro susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated in the Sao Paulo Hospital against five fluoroquinolones, three carbapenems and three cephalosporins. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Susceptibility was tested in 77 isolates of streptococci, 38 enterococci, 25 S. aureus and 91 S. epidermidis. The strains were isolated in the Sao Paulo Hospital in June and July of 1992. The susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution according to the procedure described by the national committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The antimicrobial agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin (formerly OPC 17116), DU-6859, imipenem, meropenem, biapenem, ceftazidime, cefepime and FK-037. RESULTS: The best in vitro activity was demonstrated by the new fluoroquinolones, especially DU 6859. Among the commercially available compounds, the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (81% susceptibility) and the carbapenem imipenem (74% susceptible) were the most active compounds. The highest resistance rates were shown by enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that the in vitro activities of the new carbapenems are similar to that of imipenem and the fourth generation cephalosporins are more active than ceftazidime against gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the newer fluoroquinolones were four to sixteen-fold more active than that showed by the commercially available compounds of this class, especially against enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. These results indicate that these newer fluoroquinolones should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - Experience with the Port-A-Cath in sickle cell disease.
AB  - Peripheral vein access is often a problem in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Totally implantable venous access devices (TIVAD) have offered other groups of patients safe long-term venous access. We reviewed our own experience with the use of a Port-A-Cath device in five patients with SCD undergoing exchange transfusion programmes. All five lines required removal due to infection associated with SBE, septic arthritis, pulmonary embolus and axillary vein thrombosis. The organisms involved were Staphylococcus aureus (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1) and Streptococcus sp. (1). The median working life of the catheters was 240 days (range 61-428). The median length of time from presentation to the diagnosis of a line-associated infection was 29 days (range 1-58). The rate of complications (0.4 per 100 patient days) in this small group of patients contrasts with the lower rates in patients with HIV and malignancy (0-0.1 per 100 patient days). Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer an unacceptable incidence of infective complications associated with the Port-A-Cath. Bone infection is more common where there is pre-existing infarcted tissue. While these systems provide a valuable tool, our experience has led us to discontinue the use of TIVADs in SCD.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of LB20304, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB20304 against 1,231 clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, lomefloxacin, and ofloxacin. LB20304 demonstrated the most potent activity against gram-positive bacteria. It was 32- to 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin G resistant). LB20304 was also highly active against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Its activity was more potent than those of sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin and comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. The protective activities of LB20304 against systemic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria in mice were superior to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against infections by gram-negative bacteria, LB20304 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - [Community-acquired and nosocomial septicemias in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Study the characteristics of community and nosocomial-acquired bacteremia in HIV-infected patients in order to improve curative, and if possible, preventive therapy. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 47 cases of community-acquired and 31 cases of nosocomial bacteremia identified in 63 of 436 patients hospitalized between January 1992 and December 1993 with HIV infection (53 men, 10 women, mean age 34.3 years, stage A: 1, stage B: 20, stage C: 42). The portal was identified for 68 episodes (40 in the community acquired and 28 in the nosocomial groups). The main portal was pulmonary infection (42.5% vs 17.8%; p = 0.03) and digestive tract infection due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (70%) and Salmonella spp (60%). Nosocomial bacteremia following intravenous infusions included Staphylococcus epidermidis (oxacillin-resistant in 57%) and Staphylococcus (oxacillin-sensitive) infections. Bacteremia was the immediate cause of death in 18% of the deaths occurring in the 436 patients hospitalized during the study period. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the gravity of community-acquired and nosocomial bacteremia in advanced stage HIV-infected patients. Antibiotics should be adapted on the basis of probability of the infectious agent obtained from epidemiologic data and the effectiveness of prophylaxis measures validated.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - The interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. The reference bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (GF) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (E) from 2 such persons, HeLa cells (HeLa), and an amnion cell line (Amnion). The cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a Bioscreen robot analyzer (Labsystems, Finland). Results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of LB10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - LB10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. LB10517 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at 0.25 mg/L (MIC90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. LB10517 was two- or four-fold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. Both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) were highly resistant to all compounds. LB10517 activity against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a mouse septicaemia model, LB10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. In a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of LB10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. It was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for TEM-9 than the other test compounds. LB10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. LB10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - [Clinical studies on acute otitis media in infants less than one year old].
AB  - Epidemiological and bacteriological studies were made on 164 infants less than 1  year old with acute otitis media (OMA) treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Matsuyama Red Cross Hospital between January 1991 and December 1993. The patients consisted of 101 males (61.6%) and 63 females (38.4%). Compared with the general population in Matsuyama city, the preponderance of male patients with OMA is statistically significant at the level of P = 0.05. In infants less than 1 year old males are likely to be more susceptible to OMA than females. One hundred and four patients among the 164 (63.4%) were referred by pediatricians. Fever was the most common symptom (57.9%) and the next was otorrhea (19.5%). Between the patients younger than 6 months (younger group) and those 6 months old or older (older group) there were epidemiological differences which were statistically significant at the level of P = 0.05. The older group contained 128 patients (78.0%) and the younger group 36 (22.0%). The difference in incidence between the two groups indicates that infants 6 months old or older are more susceptible to OMA than those younger than 6 months. In the older group 76.6% of the patients had bilateral OMA, while in 38.9% of those in the younger group the OMA was bilateral. In infants 6 months old or older bilateral involvement and, in contrast, in infants younger than 6 months unilateral involvement was more frequent. The period needed to cure OMA was confirmed for 179 ears of 106 patients. For 80 (44.7%) of the 179 ears the period extended beyond 4 weeks. Seventy-five of the 80 ears were those of patients in the older group. OMA in the older group tended to be more resistant to treatment. The middle ear secretion of 117 ears was examined bacteriologically. Specimens were collected from middle ear effusion of 99 ears following myringotomy and from otorrhea in 18 ears. Cultures of 68 specimens were positive for one species of bacteria and 13 cultures yielded two species. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Haemophilus influenzae were the three most common microorganisms in middle ear effusion. But it was considered that S. spidermidis was not pathogenic and was a result of contamination. In otorrhea S. aureus was frequently found. No difference in the results of bacteriological study was noted between the two groups. Transplacental IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are known to decrease after birth and their serum levels are lowest between ages 6 months and 1 year. Then the serum levels of the immunoglobulins increase gradually with active production until age 4 years. The incidence and period of restitution of OMA in infants less than 1 year old in the present study seem to reflect the above Change in the serum levels of IgG1 and IgG2 mentioned. Based on the above results emphasis is placed on close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and the pediatrician in the treatment of OMA in an infant less than 1 year old. Particularly careful follow-up is important in patients in the older age group because they tend to be more susceptible to OMA and the disease is more resistant to treatment.
TI  - The bacteriology of hidradenitis suppurativa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria have been suggested as a possible cause of hidradenitis. Different species have been found in several small studies, and particularly the presence of Streptococcus milleri has been linked to disease activity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible role of bacteria in hidradenitis. METHODS: Cultures of active lesions and serological analysis of circulating IgG antibodies were studied in 41 patients. RESULTS: Bacteria were found in 49% (20/41) of all lesions: Staphylococcus aureus, 8; S. milleri, 1; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 11; Staphylococcus hominis, 1. Corynebacterium spp., Acinetobacter and Lactobacillus spp. were found once each and considered as contaminants. Patients in whom S. aureus was found had a shorter duration of disease (mean 1.7 vs. 9.7 years for sterile lesions). No other significant correlations were found between location of disease or antibody response and the bacterial species found. CONCLUSION: S. milleri appears to be an unusual pathogen, and bacteria are only found in approximately 50% of all active hidradenitis lesions. It is suggested that S. aureus may play a temporary role in the early phase of the disease, but additional longitudinal studies of cohorts of patients are needed to clarify this point.
TI  - Effects of different surfactant preparations on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that surfactant and surfactant proteins may have direct effects on inhaled bacteria and are able to interact with lung defence mechanisms in many ways. We examined the effect of three different surfactant preparations (Alveofact, Survanta and Exosurf) approved for treatment of the infant respiratory distress syndrome on different strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae which are important neonatal pathogens and on Legionella pneumophila serogroup I as a frequent cause of pneumonia in adults. Addition of Survanta to saline seemed to delay the reduction of viable bacteria in sterile saline and induced a considerably accelerated growth of all examined E. coli strains. As opposed to this, addition of surfactant did not influence the kinetics of bacterial growth in brain-heart infusion or buffered yeast extract both with the exception of Exosurf which exerted an inhibitory effect on the multiplication of group B streptococci. Though the exact mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined, the influence of surfactant therapy on the growth of bacteria within the respiratory tract should be taken into account.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  - In laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. The absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. In a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. In a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis after radial keratotomy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the findings concerning three patients with endophthalmitis and one with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis radial keratotomy surgery. METHODS: One man referred with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis and three women referred with endophthalmitis were treated. RESULTS: After radial keratotomy surgery, during which no microperforation or macroperforation had been reported, a severe Pseudomonas panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis developed in the man. All vision was lost in that eye. Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis developed in one woman, Streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis in the second woman and Pseudomonas endophthalmitis in the third woman, after undergoing radial keratotomy procedures during which microperforations occurred. In the latter patient, bilateral simultaneous surgery was performed, but only one eye became infected. The latter two infections resulted in light perception and hand motion vision respectively. In three cases, an initial keratitis was located in the inferior cornea. CONCLUSIONS: Severe bacterial endophthalmitis can occur after radial keratotomy surgery, even in the absence of microperforation during the procedure. Any evidence of postoperative keratitis must be regarded seriously and treated aggressively. Despite use of this approach, the effect on final visual acuity can be devastating.
TI  - Effect of Candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. METHODS: Studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. The model consisted of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella bivia, and group D Streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. The status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. RESULTS: Challenge of the model with C albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. Treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/mL) resulted in a decrease in C albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. However, treatment also altered other components of the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. Addition of clotrimazole (100 micrograms/mL) to the system in the absence of C albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. Clotrimazole, although effective against C albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the normal vaginal microflora. One of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin, was active against selected gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-susceptible clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus warneri, against which it had excellent activity. S-1090 was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae among the agents compared. The in vivo efficacy of S-1090 against systemic and urinary and respiratory tract infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria was superior to that expected from the in vitro and in vivo activities of the agents against which it was compared.

FMOX, CMX, CZOP and CRMN showed the highest activities. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. But ampicillin (ABPC) was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Proteus mirabilis Most of the agents were active against P. mirabilis. FMOX, CMX, CAZ, CZON, LMOX, CFIX, CPDX, CRMN, NFLX, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. ABPC and MINO were not so active with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 10. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. Cefclidin (CFCL) and AMK showed MIC90S o
TI  - High sensitivity of Mycobacterium species to the bactericidal activity by polylysine.
AB  - Bactericidal effects of polylysine on different bacterial species were measured.  Marked differences in sensitivity were observed. Based on the concentration of polylysine required to reduce cell viability by 50%, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be the most sensitive and Escherichia coli the most resistant. In addition, two Gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius exhibited significant differences in sensitivity which suggests that the relationship between sensitivity towards polylysine and bacterial cell type is not necessarily a function of the overall cell envelope structure. The high sensitivity of mycobacteria suggests the possible use of polylysine, or a conjugate of polylysine and another agent in anti-mycobacterial drug design.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - Bacteraemia in a community and a university hospital.
AB  - Four hundred and forty-one and 1048 episodes of bacteraemia were prospectively surveyed over a period of 18 months in two hospitals, a 450 bed community hospital and a 900 bed tertiary care urban university hospital. Incidence of bacteraemia was 2.18 per 1000 hospitalization days (10.1 per 1000 admissions) in the community hospital and 2.64 per 1000 hospitalization days (12.0 per 1000 admissions (P < 0.004)) in the university hospital. Sixty six and 62% of episodes of bacteraemia were community acquired. The majority of bacteraemic episodes originated on the internal medicine wards of both hospital--46.7% and 58.7% respectively; the incidence of bacteraemia in the medical divisions of both hospitals was 23.1 and 17.5 per 1000 admissions respectively (P < 0.01). Overall mortality rates were 22% and 26.7% respectively. 39.9% and 44% of all isolates were Gram-positive pathogens. Escherichia coli was the commonest Gram-negative pathogen in both hospitals, particularly the community hospital--47.5% vs 32.8% (P < 0.005) of all Gram-negative pathogens, while Pseudomonas spp. were significantly more common in the university hospital--18.5% vs 11.8% (P < 0.02). Non-enterococcal streptococci were more common in the community hospital while enterococci were far more common at the university hospital--15.1% vs 1% of all Gram-positive pathogens (P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis was more common among the community hospital Gram-positive bacteraemias--31.1% vs 18.6% (P < 0.005). For almost all genera and species, antibiotic resistance was higher at the university hospital. Twenty nine point four per cent of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the university hospital were methicillin resistant compared to 2.4% at the community hospital (P < 0.005). 29.4% of all Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at the university hospital were penicillin resistant while no resistance was found at the community hospital. A high resistance rate to ofloxacin was found at the university hospital among S. aureus and Pseudomonas sp. Sources of bacteraemia did not differ significantly between the two hospitals. In conclusion, although outcome did not differ significantly for the two hospitals, there were significant differences between blood culture isolates in these two different settings. These differences may influence clinical decision-making about antibiotic therapy for patients in these hospitals.
TI  - The impact of bacteraemia on HIV infection. Nine years experience in a large Italian university hospital.
AB  - The object of this case control study was to evaluate the frequency, the risk factors, the microbiological spectrum and the outcome of 249 cases of bacteraemia observed in 209 HIV-infected patients, most them affected by AIDS. The rate of bacteraemia in the total yearly HIV-related admissions increased from 4% in 1985 to 13% in 1993. The more common aetiological agents of bacteraemia were: Staphylococcus aureus (29.7%), non-typhoidal species of Salmonella (14.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%). A mixed flora was found in 14% of the episodes. Multivariate analysis of predisposing factors indicated that a low CD4+T-cell count (<0.2 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.01), use of central venous catheters (CVC) (P=0.01) and neutropenia (polymorphonuclear neutrophils <1.0 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.04) were independent risk factors for the development of bacteraemia. Logistic regression did not reveal any association of bacteraemia with intravenous drug abuse (on univariate analysis P=0.04). The response (31.8%). Recurrences to specific therapy was favourable in 170 episodes (68.2%); death occurred in 79 (31.8%). Recurrences arose in 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) of them died. The outcome of bacteraemia was influenced by a low number of CD4+T-cells (P<0.001) but not of polymorphonuclear cells. Our findings suggest that bacteraemia is a relatively common event in HIV-infected patients, especially under particular conditions (e.g. intravenous drug abuse, use of CVC, neutropenia and a low CD4-T-cell count). It requires special attention from physicians who must recognise and treat the condition promptly at an early stage.
TI  - Gadolinium-based MR contrast media: potential for growth of microbial contaminants when single vials are used for multiple patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess potential risk if single-dose vials of gadolinium-based contrast media are used for multiple patients. The use of multidose vials can pose a significant risk if contaminants are accidentally introduced into the vials and proliferate. Therefore, we tested the ability of gadolinium-based contrast to support the growth of a variety of microbial pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected the unused portions of 15 single-use vials of gadolinium-based contrast media. The residual contrast material was refrigerated after use and checked for sterility prior to inoculation with a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Contrast material was incubated at room temperature and at 4 degrees C, and quantitative cultures were performed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr and at 7 days. RESULTS: No microbial growth occurred from cultures of the used contrast solutions prior to inoculation. None of the organisms tested in our study proliferated in the contrast material. All test organisms persisted at least 48 hr after inoculation at both temperatures. At 7 days, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium jeikeium were recovered in significant quantities. Colony counts of Serratia odorifera rapidly decreased at room temperature but persisted beyond 7 days at 4 degrees C. CONCLUSION: The risk of contaminating vials of contrast agents punctured aseptically is small. Our study demonstrates a lack of proliferation of organisms in the two gadolinium-based compounds tested, suggesting that these solutions could be used for more than one procedure.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lantibiotic Pep5 biosynthetic gene cluster and functional analysis of PepP and PepC. Evidence for a role of PepC in thioether formation.
AB  - The biosynthesis of Pep5, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide, is directed by the 20-kbp plasmid pED503. We identified a 7.9-kbp DNA-fragment within this plasmid which covers the information for Pep5 synthesis in the homologous host Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 which has been cured of pED503. This fragment contained, in addition to the previously described structural gene pepA and the immunity gene pepI [Reis, M., Eschbach-Bludau, M., Iglesias-Wind, M. I., Kupke, T. & Sahl, H.-G. (1994) Appl. Env. Microbiol. 60, 2876-2883], a gene pepT coding for a translocator of the ABC transporter family, a gene pepP coding for a serine protease and two genes pepB and pepC coding for putative modification enzymes; the gene arrangement is pepTIAPBC. We analyzed the biosynthetic genes with respect to their function in Pep5 biosynthesis. Deletion of PepT reduced Pep5 production to about 10%, indicating that it can be partially replaced by other host-encoded translocators. Inactivation of PepP by site-directed mutagenesis of the active-site His residue resulted in production of incorrectly processed Pep5 fragments with strongly reduced antimicrobial activity. Deletion of pepB and pepC leads to accumulation of Pep5 prepeptide in the cells without excretion of processed peptide. A pepC-deletion clone did not excrete correctly matured Pep5 but it did produce fragments from which serine and threonine were absent. Only one of these fragments contained a single lanthionine residue out of three expected while the remaining, unmodified cysteine residues could be detected by reaction with Ellman's reagent. These results demonstrate that PepC is a thioether-forming protein and strongly suggest that PepB is responsible for dehydration of serine and threonine.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. The absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. To identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. Peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mM) for 4 h and with the pH kept at 7.0 by a pH-stat. Removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or 294.4 mM [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. Hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, Streptococcus sanguis I and II (sanguis and oralis), and Strep. mitior (mitis biotype I); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mM were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mM when grown anaerobically. Earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. The amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. None of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, Neisseria sicca, Haemophilus segnis, H. parainfluenzae, Actinomyces viscosus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. The ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mM. This almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mM. In the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are well recognized. The anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. The author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with HIV who presented between August 1990 and May 1994. METHODS: Review of records. RESULTS: Nine patients were women, and four were men. Mean age was 35.2 years. The keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. The most common infecting organism was Candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. Other organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in four, Bacillus sp in two, and one each Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Micrococcus sp, and Capnocytophaga sp. Seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. Classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. Twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. CONCLUSION: Infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic HIV infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. The prognosis for recovery of vision in these patients often is poor.
TI  - [Dirithromycin in the treatment of infections of the lower respiratory tract].
AB  - Good results of the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections with dirithromycin (Eli Lilly, USA), a new semisynthetic macrolide, were recorded. The trial included 15 patients: 6 with acute bronchitis (AB) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AB) and 9 with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ECB). The antibiotic was administered orally in a single dose of 500 mg once a day for 7 days. The treatment efficacy was estimated by the clinical results and laboratory findings. The sputum specimens were investigated bacteriologically with testing the microflora for the drug susceptibility by using the diffusion disks. 50 per cent of the patients with AB isolated Streptococcus viridans with low (the diameter of the growth inhibition zones < 16 mm) and intermediate (16-17 mm) susceptibility to the antibiotic, 33.3 per cent of the patients isolated highly susceptible (19 mm) strains of Str. pneumonia and 16.7 per cent of the patients isolated resistant (15 mm) strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Highly susceptible (17-19 mm) strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Str. viridans were isolated respectively from 55.5 and 45.5 per cent of the patients with ECB. In 4 patients with ECB a clinical improvement of the state was recorded. In the other patients with AB and ECB the recovery was stated. The bacteriological tests revealed a new pathogen in 2 patients with ECB and the failure of the treatment in another 2 patients with ECB. In all the other patients the pathogen was shown to be eradicated. In the patients isolating the new pathogen the symptomatic recovery was stated in the posttherapeutic period. Therefore, diritromycin proved to be efficient in 13 out of the 15 patients with lower respiratory tract infections. It should be noted that the drug tolerance was excellent. None of the patients showed any adverse reactions.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in the conjunctival sac of patients before cataract surgery].
AB  - Retrospective analysis of 2365 cultures from conjunctival sac of patients was done. The most frequent bacteria included Staphylococcus epidermidis (48.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (11%) and Streptococcus (1%). The sensibility of the bacterial cultures for the most frequently applied chemotherapeutics was evaluated. Our results were compared with those in the literature.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of the new 4-quinolones DU-6859a and DV-7751a.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, DU-6859a and DV-7751a, was investigated against strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. DU-6859a and DV-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. Furthermore, DU-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill Ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. The bactericidal mechanisms of DV-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, DU-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both Str. pneumoniae and Ent. faecalis. This may explain the unusually potent bactericidal activity of this agent against these species. These results show that DU-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.
TI  - Sepsis in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The Madrid HIV Pediatric Infection Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - The aims of this retrospective study were to review the frequency and patterns of bacterial sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The charts of 233 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children cared for during a 10-year period in 4 tertiary hospitals in Madrid were reviewed. There were 43 episodes of sepsis in 31 (13%) children. Twenty of them had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 10 were class PA2 and 1 was class P1B. The most common organisms recovered were: nontyphoidal Salmonella, 10 cases (23%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 cases (21%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6 cases (14%); Escherichia coli, 5 cases (12%); Enterococcus faecalis, 4 cases (9%); Campylobacter jejuni, 2 cases (5%). In 28 episodes of bacteremia there were other sites of associated infection: pneumonia, 6 cases; urinary tract infection (UTI), 5 cases; gastrointestinal disease, 4 cases; catheter-related bacteremia, 12 cases. Eight patients had more than 1 episode of bacteremia. The rate of complications was high: 6 children had septic shock; and 2 of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. There was 1 death directly related to sepsis.
TI  - Factors associated with positive bacteriological cultures of chronic middle ear effusions.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria have been isolated from middle ear effusions in a number of studies. Our aim was to identify factors which predispose to patients having positive cultures. Over a 1-year period, prospective data were collected on patients admitted for myringotomy. Middle ear effusions were collected at the time of surgery using specially designed traps, and underwent microscopy and culture. Data on local weather parameters were obtained from the Meteorological Office in Edinburgh, UK and compared with the patterns of positive cultures. A higher proportion of cultures were positive in October, November and December and in February and May than in the other months of the years. We were not able to relate these variations to any of the meteorological data, with the possible exception of relative humidity, or to any other variable.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of catheter-related fungemia and bacteremia.
AB  - Forty-four patients with catheter-related infection admitted to Hokusho Central Hospital between 1985 and 1991 were studied retrospectively. The rate of catheter-related fungemia or bacteremia to all corresponding cases of fungemia and bacteremia increased from 7.7% in 1985 to 28.8% in 1991. The isolated pathogens were Candida parapsilosis (8 strains), Candida tropicalis (6 strains), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (6 strains), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (5 strains) and Streptococcus epidermidis (3 strains). Bacteremia occurred after catheterization of the femoral vein for a mean duration of 37 days. The period was significantly shorter than that after catheterization of the subclavian vein (56 days). The major isolates from the subclavian vein were Candida spp. (14/17, 82.4%), followed by MRSA (1/17, 5.9%) and MSSA (1/17, 5.9%), while isolates from the femoral vein were Candida spp. (6/16, 37.5%), MRSA (5/16, 31.3%) and MSSA (3/16, 20.8%). Catheter removal alone did not improve the clinical condition, particularly in MRSA bacteremia; the combination of antimicrobial therapy and removal of the catheter was necessary for a better prognosis.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. Flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. The rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees C, ranged from 0.1 ng/mL/min for Streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/mL/min for Clostridium perfringens. The rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. pH had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. These data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.
TI  - The high risk heart donor: potential pitfalls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of potentially infected donor hearts has been advocated to extend the supply of available hearts for transplantation. METHODS: To determine whether bacterial transmission from donor to recipient can occur with heart transplantation, we reviewed our experience with the 347 patients who received 360 heart transplants in the Utah Transplant Affiliated Hospitals from 1988 to 1993. RESULTS: During this time, nineteen donors had positive blood cultures before harvest. Sixteen donors had gram-positive bacteremia: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 9), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), streptococcus (n = 2). Two donors had gram-negative bacteremia: serratia (n = 1) and acinetobacter (n = 1). One donor had blood cultures positive for both Escherichia coli and streptococcus. Infectious complications occurred in two of three recipients who received a heart from a donor with gram-negative bacteremia: Escherichia coli endocarditis, mediastinitis, sepsis and death in one, and serratia sepsis and mediastinitis in another. In each case the organisms and sensitivities were identical between donor and recipient. No infectious complications related to the donor heart occurred among the 16 recipients who received hearts from donors with gram-positive bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Bacterial transmission from donor heart to recipient can occur, (2) bacterial transmission appears to be more common with gram-negative organisms, and (3) infection of the recipient with a gram-negative organism from the donor heart is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
TI  - The effect of ethanol ingestion on killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis by rat neutrophils.
AB  - The precise effects of chronic ethanol ingestion on the role of neutrophil function in pneumococcal pneumonia have not been fully delineated. In this study, the bactericidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) from rats pair-fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet or a liquid control diet was compared both in vitro and in vivo. The PMNL were allowed to phagocytose several bacterial species in vitro, and intracellular killing after 1h was determined by plate counts. There was no significant difference in killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae types 6B or 37, Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis by PMNL from ethanol-fed and pair-fed rats (E-PMNL and P-PMNL, respectively). However, E-PMNL killed significantly less of Streptococcus pneumoniae types 10A, 14 and 19F. To corroborate these results in vivo, rats were infected transtracheally, and quantitative lung counts were performed 1 week post infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae types 6B and 37, as well as Staphylococcus aureus, were effectively cleared from the lungs of both groups of rats. Streptococcus pneumoniae types 10A, 14 and 19F, however, were cleared well from the lungs of pair-fed but not ethanol-fed animals. These data suggest that chronic ethanol ingestion induces a strain-specific deficit in neutrophil bactericidal activity against certain S. pneumoniae which does not extend to commonly encountered staphylococci.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Recurrence of infection after revision of infected hip arthroplasties.
AB  - We performed revision surgery for infected arthroplasty in 98 hips (96 patients). In 28 hips infection persisted. Of the remaining 70 hips, 61 (87%) were reviewed after a mean interval of 5.9 years (1 to 17). Infection occurred in 10% of these after three years and in 26% after ten years. The infection rate after initially successful revision for septic arthroplasty is higher than after revision for aseptic loosening and the risk of developing infection continues for many years.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of serous otitis].
AB  - The bacteriological study of the middle ear effusion of one hundred cases of serous otitis media was performed. Results are discussed and compared to those reported in the literature.
TI  - Bacterial leakage of mineral trioxide aggregate as a root-end filling material.
AB  - Previous dye leakage studies have shown that mineral trioxide aggregate leaks significantly less than other commonly used root-end filling materials. This study determined the time needed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to penetrate a 3-mm thickness of amalgam, Super-EBA, Intermediate Restorative Material (IRM), or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as root-end filling materials. Fifty-six single-rooted extracted human teeth were cleaned and shaped using a step-back technique. Following root-end resection, 48 root-end cavities were filled with amalgam, Super-EBA, IRM, or MTA. Four root-end cavities were filled with thermoplasticized gutta-percha without a root canal sealer (+ control), and another four were filled with sticky wax covered with two layers of nail polish (- control). After attaching the teeth to plastic caps of 12-ml plastic vials and placing the root ends into phenol red broth, the set-ups were sterilized overnight with ethylene dioxide gas. A tenth of a microliter of broth containing S. epidermidis was placed into the root canal of 46 teeth (40 experimental, 3 positive, and 3 negative control groups). In addition, the root canals of two teeth with test root-end filling materials and one tooth from the positive and negative control groups were filled with sterile saline. The number of days required for the test bacteria to penetrate various root-end filling materials was determined. Most samples whose apical 3 mm were filled with amalgam, Super-EBA, or IRM began leaking at 6 to 57 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. We tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with IC than from control women. METHODS: Urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 IC patients and 7 control subjects. These specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. In addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Cultures of urine from 6 of 11 IC patients grew five different bacteria (Corynebacterium sp. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or Torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (Lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. Although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of IC patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (P < 0.05). Acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 IC patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens that grew Torulopsis. Additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 IC patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of 1 control patient. Biopsy specimens from 2 IC patients grew Torulopsis sp or Lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of Pseudomonas sp or Staphylococcus epidermidis, but no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. All other cultures and stains were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not provide evidence that IC is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. However, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of IC patients than of control subjects. If these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of IC should be addressed.
TI  - Phagocytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae measured in vitro and in vivo in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis.
AB  - Both humans and rats with liver cirrhosis have increased morbidity and mortality  from pneumococcal pneumonia. By use of a rat model of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis, uptake of fluorochrome-labeled Streptococcus pneumoniae by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and alveolar macrophages (AM) was examined by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood PMNL from cirrhotic rats showed no defect in phagocytic or bactericidal capacity for type 10A S. pneumoniae in vitro. However, in vivo, fewer type 3 S. pneumoniae were engulfed by PMNL in the lungs of cirrhotic rats with a concomitant increase in the number of organisms taken up by their AM in comparison with controls. These studies indicate the importance of using more relevant in vivo methodologies for assessing bacterial phagocytosis. In addition, the reduction in uptake of type 3 pneumococci by PMNL within the microenvironment of the cirrhotic rat lung could help to explain the increased susceptibility of cirrhotic rats to pneumococcal pneumonia.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: the role of Staphylococcus epidermidis, immune status and  intravascular coagulation.
AB  - An 83 year old Caucasian woman with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) of the right hand  is described. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the only organism cultured. Serology failed to demonstrate Streptococcus pyogenes, the common pathogen of NF. Despite antibiotic therapy, gangrene supervened, necessitating digital amputation. Staphylococcus epidermidis is usually non-pathogenic, but review of the literature indicates that it is relatively commonly found with other pathogens in NF. Accordingly, studies of immune status were undertaken. Apart from reduced myeloperoxidase production (30-50% of normal levels), all humoral, cell-mediated and neutrophil function tests were normal. This is the first report of Staphylococcus epidermidis as the sole isolate in NF and also the only study of immune status of NF patients. It is concluded that a non-virulent organism (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis) may be pathogenic in the face of advanced age alone. Elevated fibrin degradation productions were also demonstrated in the patient, consistent with lysis of localized intravascular thrombus. The role of anticoagulation in NF is discussed.
TI  - [Clinical and laboratory studies on SY5555 in pediatric infectious diseases].
AB  - Clinical effects of SY5555 dry syrup, a new oral penem antibiotic, were analysed  in 20 children with various bacterial infections. Ages of the patients varied from 8 months to 14 years. Doses of SY5555 were varied from 12.8 mg/kg/day to 30.5 mg/kg/day, and it was administered in 3 divided dosages. Clinical efficacy rates were as follows; 6/7 in acute bronchitis, 5/5 in pharyngotonsillitis, 3/3 in acute otitis media and 2/2 in cystitis and 3/3 in impetigo contagiosa. The overall rate was 95.0% (19/20). Bacteriologically, eradications were obtained with 1/2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3/3 of Staphylococcus aureus, 1/1 of Haemophilus influenzae, and each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Serratia marcescens. Diarrhea was observed in 1 patient. And elevated eosinophiles or GPT was observed in one patient each. In vivo pharmacokinetics of SY5555 was examined in 2 cases. Peak plasma levels were observed at 1 hour after dosage in one patient and at 2 hours in another upon oral administration of 8.3 mg/kg of SY5555, and peak levels were 2.44 and 1.38 micrograms/ml respectively. Half-lives of SY5555 were 1.39 and 0.59 hr. Concentrations of SY5555 in urine after administration were 70.2 (2-4 hrs.) to 91.0 (0-5 hrs.) micrograms/ml, respectively. SY5555 dry syrup is considered as an useful and safe antibiotic in treating the infectious diseases in children.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - [Study of factors affecting the appearance of a skin-allergic reaction of healthy people to antigens from microorganisms].
AB  
TI  - [The present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and M. tuberculosis].
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. The resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in S. aureus and S. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of DNA, namely by gene mecA. This gene codes altered PBP-2A protein. Strains of S.pneumoniae contain PBP-1A, PBP-2B and PBP-2X proteins. They cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium is coded by transferable vanA and vanB genes. Strains of N. meningitidis produce mostly the altered PBP-2 protein. The increase of resistance in strains of M. tuberculosis is also significant.
TI  - Nonpuerperal breast infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We undertook a microbiological study of purulent specimens from women  with symptomatic breast abscesses. METHODS: Fifty-one purulent samples were collected in 2 periods (December 1991-April 1992 and January 1994-June 1994) from nonpuerperal breast abscesses in 44 patients attending our hospital. RESULTS: One of the most frequently isolated microorganisms was Proteus mirabilis (9 patients, 20.4%), present as a pure culture in all but 1 specimen (isolated together with Peptostreptococcus spp.). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 10 specimens, 6 of which were post-tumorectomy abscesses. Polymicrobial anaerobic flora were isolated in 11 specimens (21.5%); Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (8%); and Streptococcus milleri,Alcaligenes sp., and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 1 specimen each. The 7 remaining samples (13.7%) were negative bacteriological cultures. CONCLUSIONS: We draw attention to the frequent isolation of P. mirabilis in recurrent and torpid breast abscesses in 4 women in whom surgery was necessary in addition to antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Staphylococcal and other bacterial species associated with intramammary infections in Danish dairy herds.
AB  - Four thousand six hundred forty-five quarter milk samples from 1179 cows from 20  commercial dairy herds were examined in order to determine the prevalence of bacterial species. A total of 859 isolates from 839 (18.1%) culture positive samples could be assigned to 34 different species and subspecies. Diagnostics of staphylococcal species was based on conventional procedures able to differentiate between all 36 species and subspecies presently acknowledged. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 10.2% of the samples and was the most common species isolated. Streptococcus dysgalactiae (1.6%) and Streptococcus uberis (1.4%) were the second and third most common species isolated. Seventeen different coagulase negative staphylococcal species (CNS) were found in 4.1% of the samples. The most frequently isolated CNS were S. epidermidis (1.3%), S. chromogenes (1.0%) and S. simulans (0.7%). Isolates of S. aureus were phage typed, and isolates of S. epidermidis were investigated by phage typing, antibiogram typing, and biotyping. A total of 378 (79.9%) isolates of S. aureus could be typed by phages, assigning them to 18 different phage types. However, 6 phage types accounted for 92.1% of the typable isolates. One to 2 phage types predominated within each herd. Eleven (18%) isolates of S. epidermidis could be typed by phages, assigning the isolates to 3 different types. Biotyping of S. epidermidis produced a total of 8 different types, the most common accounting for 29.5% of the isolates. A total of 6 different antibiogram types were observed among all isolates of S. epidermidis. Resistance towards penicillin (36.1%), tetracycline (9.8%) and streptomycin (9.8%), were recorded in the isolates of S. epidermidis. However, 35 (57.4%) of the isolates were susceptible to all 12 antibiotics tested.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - The effect of antiseptic solutions on microorganisms in venous leg ulcers.
AB  - The effect on the microbial ulcer flora of wet gauze dressings soaked in antiseptic solutions used for desloughing leg ulcers is not known. Quantitative cultures were therefore performed in 45 venous leg ulcers, before application and after 15 minutes' treatment with gauze dressings with four different antiseptic solutions: aluminium acetotartrate (Alsol) 1%, potassium permanganate 0.015%, acetic acid 0.25% and chloramine 0.25%. The percentage of ulcers with each type of microorganism did not differ before and after application of the antiseptic solutions. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 79% of the ulcers, gram-negative rods in 39%, S. epidermidis in 21%, Proteus spp in 21%, Pseudomonas spp in 14% and fungi in none. Potassium permanganate reduced the mean number of bacteria per ulcer from 4.4 x 10(6) to 0.9 x 10(6) (ns), chloramine from 2.7 x 10(6) to 2.2 x 10(6) (ns), Alsol from 1.2 x 10(7) to 3.5 x 10(6) (ns) and acetic acid from 6.3 x 10(6) to 2.6 x 10(5) (p = 0.007). S. aureus was reduced by acetic acid (p = 0.002), gram-negative rods by both chloramine (p = 0.03) and acetic acid (p = 0.03). The number of Pseudomonas, Proteus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus group G was not reduced significantly (p > 0.05) by any of the solutions.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol-GS, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  - Increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. We investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in Optisol corneal storage medium. The combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus Group D, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees C. The growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. Streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. The addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to Optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.
TI  - [Antiseptic and antibiotic resistance of 310 gram-positive strains isolated from  udders after use of post-milking teat germicides].
AB  - The sensitivity of 310 Gram-positive strains, isolated from milking cows udders,  to 4 antiseptics (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene and mercury) and 9 antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracycline, gentamycin, novobiocin and oxacillin) was determined. The statistical analysis of correlation was carried out for the bacterial species studied (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus), the scattering of the minimum inhibitory concentrations of which has proved to be statistically heterogeneous towards antiseptics and antibiotics. This analysis revealed positive links between chlorhexidine and 5 antibiotics for Streptococcus and between hexachlorophene and oxacillin for Bacillus. The analysis of results at the level of bacterial species, taking into account a loss of sensitivity of 4 times the modal minimum inhibitory concentration of the species reveals the importance of the strains which are resistant to many antibiotics and especially the Enterococcus and the species Staphylococcus epidermidis. Indeed, these strains are possible reservoirs of plasmids of resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - A rapid method to quantify bacterial contamination on hatching eggs. 1. Correlation of optical density with initial bacterial count.
AB  - The use of optical-density (OD) readings after a 6-h incubation period, as a suitable method to quantify the bacterial contamination on hatching eggs, was established by the use of pure cultures of five bacterial isolates found to be the most prevalent on the hatching eggs examined. These isolates were identified as Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Streptococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas cepacei and Bacillus cereus. It was established that the OD reading was repeatable when the same inoculum was used to inoculate five different cultures, which were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees C. This repeatability was not affected by bacterial isolate, or bacterial concentration of the inoculum, or when mixed bacterial cultures were used. A direct relationship was established between the OD reading (at 540 nm) after 6 h and the log of the bacterial concentration at the start of incubation. The OD reading after 6 h of incubation is a repeatable, rapid and simple method to quantify the bacterial concentration at the start of the incubation period.
TI  - The targeting of phospholipid liposomes to bacteria.
AB  - Phospholipid liposomes have been prepared from phospholipid mixtures including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (DPPC/PI) and DPPC/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPC/DPPG) mixtures and targeted to adsorbed biofilms of the skin-associated bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus vulgaris and the oral bacterium Streptococcus sanguis. The effects of time, liposome concentration and density of bacteria in the biofilm have been studied in detail for Staphylococcus epidermidis. The targeting (as assessed by the apparent monolayer coverage of the biofilms by liposomes) to the biofilms was found to be sensitive to the mol% of PI and DPPG in the liposomes and optimum levels of PI were found for targeting to each bacterium. The use of PI and DPPG-containing liposomes for the delivery of the bactericide, Triclosan, to biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis was studied as a function of the amount of Triclosan carried by the liposomes. All the liposome systems tested inhibited the growth of bacteria from the biofilms after brief (2 min) exposure to Triclosan-carrying liposomes. At low Triclosan levels bacterial growth inhibition by Triclosan-carrying liposomes exceeded that by an equivalent level of free Triclosan. After short periods (min) of exposure of biofilms to Triclosan-carrying liposomes the bactericide was shown to preferentially concentrate in the biofilms relative to its liposomal lipid carrier. The results suggest that phospholipid liposomes with appropriately chosen lipid composition have potential for the targeting and delivery of bactericide to bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of unstented aortic homografts for the treatment of prosthetic aortic  valve endocarditis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis is a serious complication that carries a high morbidity and mortality. Aortic homografts have been used in this setting, but long-term results are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over a 23-year period, 48 patients presented with infected aortic valve substitutes: 28 homografts, 15 mechanical, and 5 xenografts. Nineteen patients had emergency surgery, and the mean interval between the first and second operation was 5.9 years (range, 1 month to 22 years). In 28 patients, the preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was III or IV. Active endocarditis was present in 39 patients, and the microorganisms grown were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 13), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Streptococcus viridans (n = 6), Streptococcus faecalis (n = 4), Candida albicans (n = 5), and Gram-negative spp (n = 2). Aortic root abscesses were found in 28 (58%) patients, and transesophageal echocardiography was 95% accurate in their localization. All patients received homograft aortic valves, 19 as root replacement and 29 using the freehand technique. There were four (8.3%) early deaths; poor left ventricular function and concomitant procedure were identified as risk factors. At a mean follow-up of 4 years (range, 2 months to 19 years) 95% of the patients were in NYHA class I or II without significant aortic regurgitation. The actuarial survival at 5 years was 97% (confidence limit, 84% to 100%), and freedom from endocarditis at 10 years was 97% (confidence limit, 84% to 100%). Multivariate analysis did not identify risk factors for these late events. CONCLUSIONS: Homograft aortic valves offer good early and long-term results in patients with infected aortic valve substitutes.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested PCR strategy.
AB  - Primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16S rRNA sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16S rRNA genes of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The PCR assay was divided into two DNA amplifications. The first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. The high specificity of the PCR assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). A total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. The assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. With agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the PCR products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) CFU/ml.
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis: bacteriology, hydrocephalus, and outcome.
AB  - To investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. Among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. Of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. Of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. The infecting agents were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and Gram-negative bacilli in six patients (Escherichia coli in two, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Acinetobacter anitratus in two). In one patient, the culture results were negative. All Gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Hydrocephalus finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. No other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics and the development of hydrocephalus was found. All patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.
TI  - Cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  - Cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by Cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. Interaction studies were made by adding each of the different UV-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. The reference oral bacterial strains were: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 209 and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The target cells were: gingival fibroblasts (GF), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (PMF), pulpal fibroblasts (PF), HeLa-cells (HeLa), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (LN). Synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. The cytotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of P. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of S. aureus it was increased. Bacterial interactions with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. The cytotoxicity of F. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Group B streptococcus-induced nitric oxide production in murine macrophages is CR3 (CD11b/CD18) dependent.
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by murine macrophages in response to cytokines and/or gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. NO induction by gram-positive bacteria such as group B streptococci (GBS), the major etiologic agents of neonatal pneumonia and meningitis, has received little study. GBS as well as two other gram-positive bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were found to stimulate NO production in thioglycolate-elicited murine macrophages and in the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 in the presence of gamma interferon. Serotype Ia and III GBS were both stimulatory, as were asialo- and type antigen-deficient mutant strains of type III GBS. NO production was dose dependent, inhibitable by L-arginine analogs, and unaffected by polymyxin B. Since phagocytosis by murine and human phagocytes of GBS is dependent on complement receptor type 3 (CR3), the role of CR3 in the NO response to GBS was tested in the CR3-deficient myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3. GBS did not induce NO, whereas S. aureus or lipopolysaccharide did induce NO in WEHI-3 cells. S. epidermidis, whose nonopsonic phagocytosis is also CR3 dependent, failed to induce NO in WEHI-3 cells. Monoclonal anti-CR3 (anti-CD11b or anti-CD18) in the presence of interferon also induced NO production in thioglycolate-elicited macrophages and in J774A.1 cells but not in WEHI-3 cells. This evidence suggests that ligated CR3 and gamma interferon act synergistically to induce NO production and that CR3 mediates the GBS-induced signal for NO production in interferon-treated macrophages.
TI  - Handwashing machines, handwashing compliance, and potential for cross-contamination.
AB  - Although handwashing is considered an important factor in the prevention of nosocomial infections, the optimal technique has not been determined and compliance is often difficult to obtain. Handwashing compliance is particularly important in intensive care areas of the hospital. In an effort to improve HW compliance, the surgical intensive care unit in our hospital purchased three handwashing machines. Four months after installation of the handwashing machines, an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus occurred in the intensive care unit. As part of evaluating the outbreak, we cultured the handwashing machines, including the portholes and the paper towel dispenser. Cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Achromobacter species, and Streptococcus viridans. The design of the handwashing machines made contamination of sleeves and already-washed hands possible. An observational study revealed that handwashing compliance was poor but improved from 22% to 38% when the handwashing machines were in use. Nurses preferred handwashing at the sink and physicians preferred the handwashing machine. Handwashing machines may increase handwashing compliance because of their novelty, but they may also result in novel problems.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of Bridelia ferruginea (Euphorbiaceae).
AB  - Water and ethanol extracts of Bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. The extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella sp. The zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. Sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. The Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the Gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - Conjunctival microbial flora of clinically normal pigs.
AB  - Conjunctival swab specimens from healthy pigs were cultured to determine normal microbial population. Four commercial swine operations were selected for study. Pigs of 4 age groups were tested: nursing pigs, nursery pigs, feeder pigs, and sows. Swab specimens were taken from the conjunctival sac of each pig. Bacterial, fungal, and mycoplasmal growth was determined separately. Chlamydia sp was detected by use of an ELISA. Bacteria were recovered from 98% of specimens evaluated. alpha-Streptococcus sp (89%) was the most commonly recovered organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%) and Staphylococcus sp (39%). Mycoplasma sp was not detected in any of the specimens. Chlamydia sp was identified in 28% of all specimens evaluated. These results are similar to reports of normal conjunctival flora in other domestic animals.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657, new rifamycin derivatives.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the new rifamycin derivatives KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were compared with those of rifampin. Rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin were also tested for reference. The respective MICs of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90S) were 0.016 and 0.0078 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.016 and 0.0039 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 0.0625 and 0.016 microgram/ml, respectively, for methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. These MIC90S of KRM-1657 were equal to or 2- to 64-fold lower than those of rifampin. KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 with MIC90S of between 0.002 and 0.078 microgram/ml were 2- to 128-fold more active than rifampin against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The MIC90S of KRM-1657 for Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 0.25 and 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively; KRM-1657 was almost as active as rifampin and was 8- to 16-fold more active than KRM-1648 against these strains. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutations to resistance to KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 was equal to that to rifampin. Against systemic infection with S. aureus in mice, the efficacies of KRM-1648 and KRM-1657 were comparable to that of rifampin.
TI  - Microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  - The microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of Goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. Non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. Streptococci, predominantly S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). Beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. Haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. H. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and H. influenzae being identified in only one sample. Anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. Staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, S. epidermidis dominating. Fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. Thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.
TI  - [Infective endocarditis in patients with permanent pacemaker].
AB  - Five patients who had permanent pacemaker and infective endocarditis were analyzed. Diagnose was confirmed by a positive blood cultures in all patients and 2 of them had identifiable vegetation in the echocardiogram too. The etiologic agent was Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1 and Staphylococcus viridans in 1. Three patients were treated with antibiotics alone: one had no clinical conditions to be operated, one died before surgery and one had good response to antimicrobial therapy alone. Two patients were submitted to antibiotic therapy and surgical removal of the pacemaker system, without complications. It was concluded that the surgical removal of the pacemaker system, as soon as possible, is the choice's therapy.
TI  - Ceftibuten pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Focus on paediatric use.
AB  - Ceftibuten is an extended-spectrum, cephem antimicrobial agent formulated for oral administration. Ceftibuten is absorbed by carrier-mediated processes and passive diffusion. The absorption of ceftibuten is described adequately by a first-order process. Following oral administration, peak serum ceftibuten concentrations are reached within 2 to 3 hours. Although the absolute bioavailability of ceftibuten in humans is not known, its relative bioavailability indicates that there is relatively rapid and complete absorption of the drug. Administration of ceftibuten with food may decrease the rate of absorption and, in the case of high fat meals, may decrease the extent of absorption by approximately 20 to 30%. The results of limited studies indicate that the drug distributes well into various body tissues and fluids, with relatively high concentrations being achieved in organs that receive a significant portion of the cardiac output. In adults with normal renal function or chronic renal failure, the apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) for ceftibuten ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 L/kg and the total plasma clearance (CL/F) ranges from approximately 61 to 75 ml/min (3.7 to 4.5 L/h). Studies of ceftibuten elimination in adults have demonstrated positive linear correlation between CL/F and creatinine clearance. Following administration of a single dose of ceftibuten, approximately 67 to 94% of the drug has been recovered in the urine unchanged. The elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of ceftibuten in adults with normal renal function is approximately 2.5 hours. Significant accumulation of ceftibuten does not occur with repeated administration. Despite the fact that the mean time taken to achieve maximal serum concentration (tmax) [1.1 to 2 hours] and t1/2 beta (2.1 hours) following administration of a single dose of ceftibuten to infants and children were similar to values previously reported in adults, the Vd/F (0.42 L/kg) and CL/F (3.1 ml/h/kg) were considerably greater in children younger than 5 years. Additionally, the apparent nonrenal clearance of ceftibuten in paediatric patients (52% of CL/F) was greater than reported for adults (approximately 32% of CL/F) with normal renal function. Thus, developmental differences appear to affect the pharmacokinetic profile of ceftibuten. Ceftibuten has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, and is stable to hydrolysis by a large number of beta-lactamases. Notable exceptions with regard to the Gram-positive spectrum for ceftibuten include relative or documented resistance for most strains of Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumonia and S. enterococcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Endocarditis with pericardial bioprostheses: clinico-pathologic characteristics,  immediate and long term prognosis.
AB  - Between 1977 and 1992, 30 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in 28 patients involving pericardial bioprostheses were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. Eleven (37%) were early pericardial valve endocarditis occurring in the first 60 days following valve surgery, and 19 (63%) were late endocarditis. In both the early and late groups, more aortic that mitral valves were affected (19/30). The most frequent pathogen in the early cases was staphylococcus, (S. epidermidis in five cases, S. aureus in one). The most frequent pathogen among late cases was streptococcus: (St. viridans in four, St. faecalis in two, St. bovis in one). In four cases (13%) no pathogen was isolated. Twelve patients received antibiotic treatment alone, six specific for the pathogen and other six only arbitrarily chosen regimen. All patients were cured in the former and all patients died in the latter group (four with negative blood cultures and two in whom identification of the pathogen was delayed-Proteus mirabillis in one case and Brucella mellitensis in the other). Valve replacement during the infective endocarditis episode was necessary in 18 cases, either because of failure of the antibiotic treatment or because of heart failure secondary to prosthetic malfunction. Peri-annular abscess was present in five cases. Surgical mortality was 22.2% (4/18). In all, 11 patients (39%) died during the active stage of infective endocarditis. The most frequent cause of death was heart failure (45.5%). All four patients with negative blood cultures died. The most advisable strategy for treating bacterial endocarditis of pericardial bioprostheses is a combination of antibiotic therapy and early surgery, especially in cases of staphylococcus endocarditis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - Late onset endophthalmitis associated with filtering blebs.
AB  - A consecutive series of 71 cases of late onset endophthalmitis (defined as onset  of symptoms at least 2 weeks after surgery) were reviewed to determine the association of this entity with glaucoma surgery filtering blebs and to identify any predisposing factors. Sixteen cases were associated with filtering blebs and two with inadvertent blebs following cataract surgery. Onset of endophthalmitis ranged from 24 days to 20 years after surgery (mean, 6.9 years). Possible contributing factors included trauma, vitreous wicks, and bleb leak. Twelve cases were culture-positive, with 5 cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis; 2, Staphylococcus aureus; 4, Streptococcus; and 1, Pseudomonas. There were no cases of Hemophilus. The more virulent organisms were generally associated with a poor visual outcome. The organisms recovered in this series were similar to those found in postoperative endophthalmitis not associated with filtering blebs.
TI  - Loofah sponges as reservoirs and vehicles in the transmission of potentially pathogenic bacterial species to human skin.
AB  - Loofah sponges are natural products used as exfoliative beauty aids. As a consequence of tracing a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis to a contaminated loofah sponge, we assessed the role of loofah sponges in supporting the growth of a wide variety of bacterial species. Our data show growth enhancement of sterile loofah fragments for numerous gram-negative (Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and Klebsiella) and gram-positive (Enterococcus and group B Streptococcus) species of human and environmental origin. Furthermore, hydrated new, unused loofah sponges undergo a shift in bacterial flora from sparse colonies of Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis to a predominantly gram-negative flora. The growth-promoting potential of loofah sponges (and other exfoliatives) can be further augmented by desquamated epithelial cells entrapped in the loofah fibrous matrix. Therefore, as loofah sponges (and other exfoliatives) can serve as a reservoir and a vehicle for the transmission of potentially pathogenic species to the human skin, we recommend their decontamination with hypochlorite (10%) bleach at regular intervals.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect associated with rabbit primary aqueous humour.
AB  - Viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. Controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. Rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Micrococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were not affected. The factor mediating the bactericidal effect survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 1 hour. The bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C for 3 hours. The antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.
TI  - [Acute epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AEHC) in Madagascar 1991].
AB  - An epidemic of A.E.H.C. was broken out everywhere in Madagascar during hot season from September 1990 to May 1991 with an important acuteness in February and March. Clinical symptoms are those of A.E.H.C. to enterovirus with some particularities. Virological study shows cytopathogenic effect of enterovirus and microbiology shows the existence of several bacterial germs particularly staphylococcus epidermidis. The discovery of two cases of streptococcus pneumonia and the absence of chlamydia trachomatis make the originality of our cases. The efficacy of the association antibiotic and steroids is spectacular.
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Palacos gentamicin for the treatment of deep periprosthetic hip infections.
AB  - Between 1983 and 1986, 40 hip arthroplasties in 40 patients with documented deep  infection were reimplanted using Palacos Gentamicin at The Hospital for Special Surgery. Palacos Gentamicin was added to the standard protocol, which included removal of the prosthesis, cement, if present, and a thorough debridement of infected and necrotic tissue, six weeks of intravenous antibiotics with a postpeak serum bactericidal titer of at least 1:8 against the infecting bacteria, followed by reimplantation of the hip. Sixteen of the patients also had the placement of gentamicin-impregnated beads at the time of prosthetic removal. All patients had a deep periprosthetic infection, 13 with Staphylococcus epidermidis, seven Staphylococcus aureus, four Streptococcus, three Enterococcus, three with gram-positive bacteria, four Escherichia coli, two Proteus, one Pseudomonas, and three anaerobic organisms. At an average follow-up period of five years (range, two to ten), two of the 40 hips (5%) developed recurrent infection. These cases recurred at one month in a patient immunocompromised by end-stage systemic lupus erythematosus (S. epidermidis) and at five months in a patient with severe titanium metallosis (S. aureus). No recurrence was noted in eight cases with gram-negative organisms or in three cases of mixed infections. No infection recurred after five months in the remaining patients before their death or last follow-up examination. Of the remaining 38 hips, 16 died of causes unrelated to the hip, leaving 21 with an average follow-up period of 7.5 years. Clinical results in these patients were 14 excellent, five good, two fair, and no poor results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Growth phase-dependent regulation and membrane localization of SpaB, a protein involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin.
AB  - The information responsible for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin is organized in an operon-like structure that starts with the spaB gene. The spaB gene encodes an open reading frame consisting of 1,030 amino acid residues, and it was calculated that a protein having a theoretical molecular mass of 120.5 kDa could be produced from this gene. This is consistent with the apparent molecular weight for SpaB of 115,000 which was estimated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and identification with SpaB-specific antibodies. The SpaB protein is very similar to proteins EpiB and NisB, which were identified previously as being involved in epidermin and nisin biosynthesis. Upstream from SpaB a characteristic sigma A promoter sequence was identified. An immunoblot analysis revealed that SpaB expression was strongly regulated. No SpaB protein was detected in the early logarithmic growth phase, and maximum SpaB expression was observed in the early stationary growth phase. The expression of SpaB was strongly correlated with subtilin biosynthesis. Deletion mutations in either of two recently identified regulatory genes, spaR and spaK, which act as a "two-component" regulatory system necessary for growth phase-dependent induction of subtilin biosynthesis (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, and K. D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:296-303, 1993), also resulted in failure of SpaB expression. To investigate the intracellular localization of SpaB, vesicles of Bacillus subtilis were prepared. The SpaB protein cosedimented with the vesicle fraction and was released only after vigorous resuspension of the vesicles. Our results suggest that SpaB is membrane associated and that subtilin biosynthesis occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane of B. subtilis.
TI  - Prevalence of urinary tract infection among school children in a Nigerian rural community.
AB  - A survey was carried out to determine the prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) among primary school children in Awka Local Government Area of Anambra State between March and July, 1987. The asymptomatic survey was carried out by random screening of 100 urine samples of healthy pupils (50 boys and 50 girls) aged between 4-16 years. Results of the survey showed that 6 boys (12%) and 24 girls (48%) were positive for the infection. At the General Hospital, Awka, 100 urine samples of children (34 boys and 66 girls) who came to the hospital complaining of loin pain were studied. Out of this number, 10 boys (29.4%) and 47 girls (71.2%) gave positive results. In so-called healthy children (asymptomatic cases) Pseudomonas aeruginosa was of high incidence in both boys (33.3%) and girls (25.0%) while P. vulgaris occurred only in boys (16.7%). In symptomatic cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis was of the highest incidence: 30.0% in boys and 27.6% in girls. Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Streptococcus fecalis and Candida albicans were isolated only from girls in both cases.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - The use of phospholipid liposomes for targeting to oral and skin-associated bacteria.
AB  - Phospholipid (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) plus phosphatidylinositol (PI)) proteoliposomes with surface bound lectins (succinylated concanavalin A (s con A) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)) have been prepared covering a range of size and surface density of lectin. Negatively charged phospholipid liposomes from DPPC-PI mixtures covering a range of PI mole % and positively charged liposomes from DPPC-cholesterol-stearylamine (SA) mixtures covering a range of SA mole % have been prepared. The targeting of the liposomes and proteoliposomes to a range of oral and skin-associated been prepared. The targeting of the liposomes and proteoliposomes to a range of oral and skin-associated bacterial biofilms has been investigated. The oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans and gordonii and the skin-associated bacterium Coryneform hofmanni can be targeted with s con A bearing proteoliposomes while the skin associated bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis can be targeted with WGA bearing proteoliposomes. Both oral and skin-associated bacteria can be targeted with positively charged liposomes although the extents of adsorption to the biofilm are low except for Staphylococcus epidermidis. In the case of negatively charged liposomes targeting is critically dependent on the PI content of the liposomes and for all the bacteria studied optimum levels PI for targeting have been found. The adsorption of the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii to immobilised monolayers having the optimum PI level for adsorption has been studied by total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM). Both the phospholipid and proteoliposomes have been used to deliver the bactericide Triclosan to biofilms. All the systems studied inhibited bacterial growth to varying degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Meconium aspiration syndrome and neonatal outcome in a developing country.
AB  - The outcome in 148 inborn meconium-stained neonates was studied prospectively over a 5-month period. Fifty-three infants (38.5%) developed meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). There was a significantly higher rate of MAS (p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (p < 0.016) and hospital stay (p < 0.016) in neonates with meconium in the trachea than in neonates with no meconium in the oropharynx. The incidence of MAS was significantly higher and the duration of hospital stay longer in outborn than in inborn infants (p < 0.022).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cytotoxic drugs may influence isolation of bacteria and fungi from blood cultures.
AB  - The potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against Gram positive and negative bacteria and Candida albicans was examined. The time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. Doxorubicin retarded the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. An inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.
TI  - Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis following cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Report on nine patients.
AB  - Between 1987 and 1992, nine patients (three men and six women; mean age, 75 years) presented with chronic postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Eight patients were referred from another institution. The interval between IOL implantation and the beginning of intraocular inflammation averaged 5.6 months (range, 1-19 months). The referral diagnosis was "toxic lens" syndrome in seven patients. The main clinical findings were a hypopyon in the anterior chamber (n = 8) and in the capsule bag (n = 2), and "fibrosis" of the lens capsule (n = 7). In eight patients a vitrectomy was performed, combined with removal of the IOL in six cases and with a total posterior capsulectomy in five cases. Pathogenic organisms were identified in vitreous aspirate (6/8), in culture (3/3), and on histopathological examination (4/5) of lens capsule and included coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 3, Staphylococcus epidermidis), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Streptococcus viridans (n = 1), Rhodococcus erythropodes and R. luteus (n = 1), and one hyphomycete (Alternaria alternata). In chronic recurrent intraocular inflammations following IOL implantation, an infectious agent should be excluded by diagnostic and therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy including removal of the IOL and posterior capsulectomy.
TI  - Cefepime as treatment for osteomyelitis and other severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Cefepime, a novel, injectable alpha-methoxyimino aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, is active in vitro against many of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which cause severe infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is more active than existing third-generation cephalosporins against multiply-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae because of its low affinity for beta-lactamases and its resistance to hydrolysis by these enzymes. Cefepime retains its high potency of activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci other than enterococci. Seventy-four patients (46 male and 28 female) were treated with cefepime 2 g i.v. every 12 h; 61 patients were evaluable for efficacy (39 male and 22 female). The infections included pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacilli (21 patients, six with bacteraemia), septicaemia (seven), pyelonephritis (two), osteomyelitis (23, mainly caused by S. aureus), septic arthritis (four) and soft tissue infections (four, one with bacteraemia). Responses were as follows: 52 (85.3%) patients cured; three (4.9%) improved and six (9.8%) failed. The failures included three patients with osteomyelitis, one with pyelonephritis and two with pneumonia. The pathogens and eradication rates were: S. aureus 23/24 (96%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 4/4, Streptococcus spp. 10/10 (100%), P. aeruginosa 11/14 (79%), Enterobacteriaceae 28/28 (100%), Haemophilus spp. 3/3 and others 7/7. Clinical adverse effects included diarrhoea in 11 patients (14.9%) nausea in five (6.8%) and pruritus in three (4.1%). Laboratory abnormalities included leucopenia in three patients (4.1%) and direct Coombs' conversion in 32 (43.2%). Patients were treated for an average of 31.8 days for osteomyelitis and 11.9 days for other infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  - One hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. Beta-Lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-Lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 Streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 Escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 Bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 Proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 Staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). Anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%). However, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. Therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Association of microbiologic flora with clinical, endoscopic, and pulmonary cytologic findings in foals with distal respiratory tract infection.
AB  - Undifferentiated distal respiratory tract disease (nasal discharge, cough, pneumonia) in foals (1 to 8 months old) is a burdensome economic problem on breeding farms; yet, the infective agents associated with these episodes have not been well described. Possible causes of these episodes of illness were investigated by culturing specimens of proximal and distal airways of clinically diseased foals (n = 101), prior to any treatment, for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and viruses (rhinoviruses, equine arteritis virus, equine herpesvirus subtype 1 [EHV-1], influenza virus, and adenovirus). Pairs of sera (n = 47) were examined for antibodies to influenza A virus, equine subtypes 1 and 2, EHV-1, and adenovirus antigens, and sera obtained from foals during acute infection were examined for antibodies (by agar gel immunodiffusion [AGID]) to equi factor antigens of Rhodococcus equi. Viruses were not isolated from the proximal (swab) or distal (bronchial lavage) airway specimens in foals, and only 2 of 47 randomly selected foals seroconverted to EHV-1. Serotiters to the other viruses were low and frequently decreasing between samples, which was compatible with maternally derived antibody. Streptococcus zooepidemicus was the predominant isolate from bronchial lavage specimens (88/101 cases), accompanied by alpha-hemolytic streptococci (8 cases), Bordetella bronchiseptica (13 cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9 cases), and other organisms in lesser frequency. Only Str zooepidemicus was recovered significantly (P < 0.05) more often in cases than in controls. The AGID test was found useful to detect foals with presumed exposure to R equi, but positive tests results did not correspond well with bacterial culture results; positive AGID results were recorded in 34% of culture-negative foals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Significance of serial C-reactive protein responses in neonatal infection and other disorders.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to determine prospectively whether, in the presence of proved or presumed bacterial infection, the sensitivity of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) response could be enhanced by serial rather than single determinations. We also sought to assess CRP responses to clinically identified noninfectious disorders. DESIGN: The CRP responses of 491 infants on 691 occasions of suspected infection were assessed. CRP levels were measured initially and twice again at 12-hour intervals (rate immunonephelometry). Assessments also included a blood culture, complete blood cell count, and chest radiograph and culture of spinal fluid when appropriate. CRP responses were correlated with four designated clinical groups: (1) positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultures (n = 190); (2) negative blood culture-definite infection (necrotizing enterocolitis stages 2 and 3, pneumonia, subcutaneous abscess) (n = 52); (3) negative blood culture-possible infection (antenatal risk factors, meconium aspiration, positive urine group B streptococcus antigen, necrotizing enterocolitis stage 1, febrile infants) (n = 287); and (4) negative blood culture-no infection (respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, patent ductus arteriosus, tissue trauma) (n = 160). Diagnoses were made before CRP results were known. RESULTS: In all, 187 (27%) of the blood cultures were positive. A single organism was recovered from 174 of these; two organisms from 13. Among the single-organism cultures, 50 (29%) were Gram-negative, 120 (69%) were Gram-positive, and 4 (2%) were budding yeasts. CRP levels were elevated in various groups as follows: in the positive blood culture group (by organism), Gram-negative rods, 92% (46/50); group B streptococcus, 92% (12/13); Staphylococcus aureus, 89% (8/9); group D streptococcus, 71% (10/14); Streptococcus viridans, 60% (6/10); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 55% (40/73). In the negative blood culture-definite infection group, CRP levels were abnormal in 88%; in the negative culture-possible infection group, CRP was elevated in 33%; and in the negative blood culture-no infection group, CRP was elevated in 9%. Serial determinations of CRP resulted in enhanced sensitivity in the positive blood culture group, the negative blood culture-definite infection group, and the negative blood culture-possible infection group. Initial determinations by themselves were inadequately sensitive. Serial determinations did not enhance sensitivity of the negative blood culture-no infection group. High specificity (91%) is suggested by the low incidence of abnormal CRP levels among infants who were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that it would be appropriate to conduct a cautious, controlled trial to assess the safety of discontinuing antibiotic therapy if three serial CRP measurements are normal and if there are no other clinical factors suggestive of infection. The data also indicate the necessity for serial determinations of CRP for optimal sensitivity.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Infected atrial myxoma simulating infective endocarditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present a case of infected atrial myxoma simulating bacterial endocarditis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 75 year old male, without any antecedents of interest, with fever an evolution a month, and a cardiac murmur. Blood cultures were practiced by BACTEC N.R. 730 system. The diagnosis was performed by the bidimensional and transesophageal echo, and confirmed with the resection from surgery. The method of bibliographical review used, has been the data base of comprehensive Medline, cvc since 1987 up June 1992 and the Oncodise's Concerlit archive from the year 1985 up to june 1992 the date base of the IME (Indice Medico Espanol) was also review up to April 1992. RESULTS: The blood cultures were positive, 7/7 Streptococcus viridans and 3/7 a Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to meticiline, we them with the same antibiogram. Echocardiography and angiography show a lef atrial mass, surgical resection of the mass, confirmed the hystological diagnostic of the myxoma and signs of infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case in our country, with shows the rarity of it. We analyze the differential diagnosis with the non infected myxoma and the bacterial endocarditis. We think that there should be an early surgical treatment, together with antibiotic therapy, due to the high incidence of embolism in theses patients.
TI  - Splenic abscess in the intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: From 1980 through 1990, nine patients developed de novo splenic abscess during their stay in our intensive care unit (ICU), representing the first series of such reported cases. RESULTS: All nine patients were septic prior to the diagnosis of splenic abscess. The signs and symptoms of splenic abscess commonly described in the literature were of little help in detecting this pathology in ICU patients. Mean +/- SD platelet count, however, increased significantly, from 274 x 10(9)/L +/- 50 x 10(9)/L at admission to 647 x 10(9)/L +/- 94 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis. At diagnosis, left pleural effusion was present in all patients. Only three patients had detectable left upper quadrant tenderness. Abdominal computed tomographic scans, when used, were diagnostic in all cases. All patients were treated by splenectomy; eight had a solitary abscess. Six abscesses were caused by enteric organisms, two by Staphylococcus aureus, and one by Streptococcus epidermidis. Eight patients (89%) had had the offending organism previously isolated from their blood or from another infected site. Mortality was 45%. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic abscess, although a rare clinical entity, does occur de novo in ICU patients and is associated with significant mortality. Unexplained thrombocytosis in a septic ICU patient with persistent left pleural effusion is suggestive of splenic abscess. Previous culture and sensitivity results are useful in guiding perioperative antibiotic choices.
TI  - The gastrointestinal tract. The "undrained abscess" of multiple organ failure.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study determined the association between proximal gastrointestinal (GI) colonization and the development of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection and multiple organ failure (MOF) in a population of critically ill surgical patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ICU-acquired infection in association with progressive organ system dysfunction is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critical surgical illness. Oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with the characteristic infecting species is common, but its association with ICU morbidity is poorly defined. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 41 surgical ICU patients was undertaken. Specimens of gastric and upper small bowel fluid were obtained for quantitative culture; the severity of organ dysfunction was quantitated by a numeric score. RESULTS: One or more episodes of ICU-acquired infection developed in 33 patients and involved at least one organism concomitantly cultured from the upper GI tract in all but 3. The most common organisms causing ICU-acquired infection--Candida, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci--were also the most common species colonizing the proximal GI tract. Gut colonization correlated with the development of invasive infection within 1 week of culture for Pseudomonas (90% vs. 13% in noncolonized patients, p < 0.0001) or Staphylococcus epidermidis (80% vs. 6%, p < 0.0001); a weaker association was seen for colonization with Candida. Infections associated with GI colonization included pneumonia (16 patients), wound infection (12 patients), urinary tract infection (11 patients), recurrent (tertiary) peritonitis (11 patients), and bacteremia (10 patients). ICU mortality was greater for patients colonized with Pseudomonas (70% vs. 26%, p = 0.03); organ dysfunction was most marked in patients colonized with one or more of the following: Candida, Pseudomonas, or S. epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The upper GI tract is an important reservoir of the organisms causing ICU-acquired infection. Pathologic GI colonization is associated with the development of MOF in the critically ill surgical patient.
TI  - Skin microflora of atopic eczema in first time hospital attenders.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the skin was assessed quantitatively in 50 children with eczema, aged 6 months to 14 years, referred to the hospital for the first time. Twenty nonatopic controls with an unrelated non-infective disorder were also studied. Cotton-tipped swabs and contact agar discs were taken from the worst affected area of eczema and from an uninvolved site in patients and from the forearm in controls. Swabs were also taken from the nose, axilla and groin in all children. Bacterial colonization of the skin was consistently more common and greater in amount from patients compared with controls. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated from patients only; from the worst affected area of eczema in 74% of patients and from an uninvolved skin site in 30% of patients. Quantitative assessment showed that the density of colonization was proportional to the severity of eczema. The most common S. aureus phage group was group II accounting for 32% of strains. Resistance to penicillin was present in 88% of strains and to two or more antibiotics in 38% of strains. No relationship was noted between the pattern of resistance and phage group.
TI  - [Neonatal conjunctivitis: microbiologic study and antibiotic sensitivity].
AB  - We have analyzed retrospectively fifty conjunctival samples from infants less than one month of age affected with conjunctivitis. Of these samples, 84% had a positive bacterial culture, with the microorganisms isolated, in order of frequency, being: Staphylococcus epidermidis (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (14%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), Haemophilus sp, Chlamydia and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (8%). All of these showed a high sensitivity to most of the drugs tested, except to penicillin and its derivatives. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin showed the highest in vitro activities. Of the pharmacological ophthalmic preparations commercially available in our country, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, erythromycin and tobramycin are the agents more active against the bacteria described above.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity and in vitro corneal epithelial toxicity of antimicrobial  agents for gram-positive corneal pathogens.
AB  - We assessed in vitro the antimicrobial activity of four agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, mupirocin, and imipenem) which are effective against Gram-positive cocci causally associated with bacterial keratitis, as well as their corneal epithelial cytotoxicity. Minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (MIC90s) against 10 strains each of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were as follows: vancomycin (MIC90s 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), teicoplanin (MIC90s 0.25-4 micrograms/ml, mupirocin (MIC90s 0.12-4 micrograms/ml), and imipenem (MIC90s 0.008-0.25 micrograms/ml, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci with MIC90 of 16 micrograms/ml). Cytotoxicity was assayed by uptake of 3H-thymidine by rabbit corneal epithelial cell cultures at drug concentrations of 12.5-100 mg/ml for vancomycin and teicoplanin, 1-8 mg/ml for mupirocin and 0.125-8 mg/ml for imipenem, with exposure times of 5, 30 and 60 min. Cytotoxicity was as follows: imipenem < mupirocin < vancomycin < or = teicoplanin. Resistance to methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis for imipenem and resistance to S. epidermidis and cytotoxicity for teicoplanin limit their consideration for suspected Gram-positive keratitis. On the other hand, vancomycin and mupirocin, because of their excellent therapeutic indices, should be considered for this indication.
TI  - Microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in Malaysia.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. Seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period January 1985 to December 1988. More than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. Chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. Approximately 25% of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections. Pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. Streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being Streptococcus milleri. Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putrifaciens and Bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. Streptococcus milleri, Bacteroides sp and Eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. In patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. Anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. Culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the detection of the anaerobes. Based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Clinical bacteriology of dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - To better define the spectrum and relative incidence of pathogens causing dacryocystitis in adults, samples of purulent lacrimal sac contents were obtained from 236 patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy for a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis. Positive culture results were obtained in 52.5%. Cultures were pure, consisting of a single organism in 71%, and were mixed in 29%. Gram-positive organisms were most common, accounting for 64.5% of the isolates. Staphylococcus epidermidis, comprising 27.3% of the isolates and Staphylococcus aureus, comprising 22.1% of the isolates, were the most frequently encountered organisms. Gram-negative organisms were present in 27.3% of the isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common, accounting for 8.7% overall. Anaerobic organisms were found in 7.0% of the isolates with Propionibacterium acnes the most frequent, recovered in 4.7% overall. Unexpected findings included the paucity of Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms recovered and the high incidence of involvement by gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Mallorca, Spain, 1977-1991.
AB  - In a retrospective study at Son Dureta Hospital (Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca, Spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. Overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. The case-fatality rate was 7.5%. Infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group B Streptococcus and Listeria species. The patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. From 1977 to 1984, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. Group B Streptococcus organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. The frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. Invasive infection caused by Candida organisms was found in two patients. The incidence of infection due to group B streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Resistance to the antimicrobial agents of bacteria isolated from non-sterile pharmaceuticals.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial resistance of 391 bacterial strains isolated from 389  samples of oral and topical medicaments was examined. The numbers of strains isolated (and percentage of samples that present them) were: 234 Bacillus (32.1%), 79 Staphylococcus (13.6%), 46 Micrococcus (11.3%), nine Pseudomonas (1.5%), eight Acinetobacter (1.5%), five Enterococcus (1.2%), three Alcaligenes (0.8%), two Escherichia and Enterobacter (0.5%), one each Providencia, Serratia and Streptococcus (0.2%). Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from topical and oral medicaments and Gram-negative rods were detected only in topical medicaments. The 97.4% of Bacillus strains were resistant to lincomycin and B. cereus was resistant to beta-lactam and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Staphylococcus spp. showed a high percentage of resistant strains to ampicillin (51.8%), tetracycline (40.5%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (48.1%). Staphylococcus epidermidis had the highest number of multiresistant strains. The 23.9% of Micrococcus strains were resistant to colistin. Enterococcus and Streptococcus strains showed multiresistance to penicillin G, aminoglycosides and erythromycin. The 61.5% of Gram-negative rod strains showed multiresistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and erythromycin; Pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant.
TI  - A new model for infective endocarditis of the mitral valve in rabbits.
AB  - To produce an experimental model of infective endocarditis without inserting catheters into the heart, we injected a bacterial suspension into rabbits in which mitral complex lesions had been induced by electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus. Typical infective vegetations grew on the surface of the mitral valves 1 week later. The formation of vegetations was related to the timing of the inoculation. Streptococcus viridans injected just after vagal stimulation produced vegetations in 10 of 17 animals (58.8%), but the same bacteria injected 14 days after vagal stimulation did so in only 2 of 11 animals (18.2%). The incidence of infective endocarditis was significantly higher after early inoculation compared with delayed inoculation (p < 0.01). The susceptibility to infection depended on the species of bacteria injected. Both S. viridans and Pseudomonas pseudoalkaligenes injected just after vagal stimulation produced vegetations in 10 of 17 (58.8%) and 6 of 13 (46.2%) animals, respectively, but Staphylococcus epidermidis injected just after vagal stimulation did not produce vegetations in any of the 10 animals. S. viridans injected into nine normal animals never produced vegetations. These findings indicate that infective endocarditis develops after intravenous injection of bacterial suspensions alone in rabbits with mitral complex lesions.
TI  - The efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by Streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  Enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), Streptococcus bovis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 mL/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 mL/min). In nine patients valve replacements were performed. Twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. Overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. Out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. In one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. One patient had a clinical relapse. All cultures taken from blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of seven days therapy. Side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. No renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. Our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bacteria reactive to plaque-toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are related  to the severity of gingivitis at the sampled site.
AB  - Certain monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) neutralize the inhibition of HL60 cell growth by bacterial plaque extracts. The aim of this study was to enumerate and identify the bacteria reactive to these Mabs at sites where periodontal disease was measured by gingival index, pocket depth and attachment loss. The bacterial colonies were grown on blood agar and the colonies counted directly and after immunoblotting. Sites that bled on probing (n = 15) had a mean of 3.35% Mab-positive colonies (SEM = 0.52%) and sites that did not bleed (n = 9) had a mean of 1.61% (SEM = 0.41%). The percentage of Mab-positive colonies also correlated with gingival index but not with the total number of colonies sampled, attachment loss or pocket depth. Antigen was expressed by 4 genera: strains of Streptococcus sanguis and/or Eikenella corrodens (8 sites), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4 sites) and Corynebacterium minutissimus (1 site). The results suggest that the antigens detected on these bacteria by the Mabs may be processed to form toxins and maintain gingivitis by irritating the surrounding cells.
TI  - Combination antibiotic supplementation of corneal storage medium.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci frequently contaminate donor corneal tissue and represent the most common cause of postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis. Although gentamicin is currently added to corneal storage medium in an effort to decrease bacterial contamination of donor tissue, it has poor or variable in vitro activity against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci. To investigate whether the antibiotic supplementation of corneal storage media could be improved, we surveyed 11 antibiotics for antimicrobial efficacy under simulated storage conditions against gentamicin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and St. viridans. All antibiotics showed markedly reduced activity at 4 C as compared to their predicted activity at 37 C. Bactericidal activity of streptomycin and tobramycin was enhanced by preceding 4 C storage with a three-hour period at room temperature (23 C). Under these conditions, streptomycin showed the best antimicrobial activity of the 11 antibiotics tested. Addition of gentamicin to streptomycin resulted in further improvement of activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, whereas the addition of penicillin G to streptomycin enhanced the activity against St. viridans. Optimal antibiotic activity (99% or more killing) against all four isolates of gentamicin-resistant gram-positive cocci was best achieved with the combination of gentamicin, streptomycin, and penicillin G, coupled with a three-hour period at room temperature before 4 C storage.
TI  - [Infectious complications during treatments with interleukin-2].
AB  - Between January 1989 and May 1991, 97 patients were treated with interleukin 2 in the Oncology Department of the Avicenne Hospital (Bobigny, France). IL 2 was given over 5 days by continuous infusion through an implantable port. Ten patients (4 males, 6 females), mean age 46 years (36-67) with various cancers (breast 3, kidney 1, melanoma 1, colorectal 5), developed infection: 4 local infections around the port, 1 phlebitis, 4 septicemias, 1 bacteremia were observed. In 9 cases blood cultures were positive: Staphylococcus aureus 5, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3, Streptococcus G 1. In 5 cases the same pathogen was isolated from the port and from the blood. The mean leucocyte count was 10,627/mm3 at the time of infection. The delay between the beginning of interleukin 2 treatment and the infection was 3 months. The mean dose of IL 2 administered before infection was 456 million IU. In all cases infection was controlled without lethal complication by antibiotics and catheter removal. This high incidence (8 percent) of staphylococcal infection is partly due to the skin toxicity of IL 2 and to depressed neutrophil chemotactic response. Prophylactic antibiotics are warranted during IL 2 intravenous therapy.
TI  - Detection and estimation of aflatoxins using both chemical and biological techniques.
AB  - Production of aflatoxins on both natural (rice and corn) and semisynthetic (YES)  media was conducted using an identified toxin-producing strain ofAspergillus flavus. TheA flavus strain was able to produce 4 types of aflatoxins, namely B1, B2, G1, and G2 on rice, corn, and YES media. Quantitative data showed that the concentrations of aflatoxins B1 and G1 produced were 52, 40.3, and 39.6; and 64.7, 45.0, and 58.0jug for 50g of rice, corn, and YES media, respectively. In comparison, the yielded amounts of aflatoxins B2 and G2 were much lower: 11.5, 17.9, and 17.5; and 28.S, 40.3, and 39.5 mug for 50 g of rice, corn, and YES media, respectively.A bioassay was conducted using the following 5 standard bacterial strains:Bacillus megaterium. Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecal is, Staphylococcus epidermidis, andParacoccus denitrificans as well as a field strain of Candida albicans. All strains exceptP denitrificans showed varied degrees of inhibition when applied with crude aflatoxins at 5 to 40mug/mL. The minimum concentration of crude aflatoxins needed to inhibitP denitrificans was 10mug/mL. Moreover,Candida albicans was not inhibited at any concentration of aflatoxins applied in this work.Both undiluted and diluted (1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000) bacterial broth cultures showed a direct relationship between the diameter of inhibition zones and the concentrations of crude aflatoxins. Mean diameters of (7.0-20.5), (5-14), (4.5-13.0), (3.0-12.0), and (1.5-11.0) mm were observed when various concentrations of aflatoxins were applied usingB megaterium, S epidermidis, S faecal is, B subtilis, andP denitrificans, respectively.Field trials were applied to testify the validity of our data. A 1/100 dilution was prepared from each strain of 4 different species to estimate aflatoxins in samples of contaminated corn. Both chemical and biological assays were carried out at the same time. Data revealed that the most sensitive organism inhibited by as low as 7.5mug aflatoxins/mL wasB megaterium giving an inhibition zone of 10.5 mm, followed byS epidermidis with an inhibition zone of 7.5mm. In relation, the other 2 organisms were less sensitive to crude aflatoxins. Similarly, the biological assay was applied to detect aflatoxins in some samples of wheat, corn, peanut, rice, and poultry rations. Of the 14 wheat and 10 corn samples, only 4 wheat and 2 corn samples were found to be positive. The same results were obtained using TLC analysis.
TI  - Prosthetic valve endocarditis. Experience with porcine bioprostheses.
AB  - Prosthetic valve endocarditis remains an infrequent but serious complication of cardiac valvular replacement. Prosthetic valve endocarditis was diagnosed in 56 (1.8%) of 3200 patients in whom one or more porcine bioprostheses were implanted between 1975 and 1988. Of the 56 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, there were 40 men and 16 women, with a mean age at initial implantation of 57 years (27 to 81 years). Of the 56 patients, 6 were initially treated for native valve endocarditis. There were 8 cases of early prosthetic valve endocarditis (defined as occurring less than 60 days after initial surgical intervention) and 48 cases of late prosthetic valve endocarditis (occurring after 60 days). The overall mortality rate of the 56 patients was 32% (18 patients). Of the 8 patients with early prosthetic valve endocarditis, 6 (75%) died. Of the 48 patients with late prosthetic valve endocarditis, 12 (25%) died. The predominant organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (12 cases), Streptococcus viridans (8 cases) and Staphylococcus aureus (7 cases). The presence of hemodynamic compromise, including congestive heart failure, septic embolism, persistent sepsis, and echocardiographic evidence of vegetations, dictated the mode and timing of the addition of surgical intervention to medical therapy. The survival rate for medically and surgically treated patients with late prosthetic valve endocarditis was 91% (20 patients); none of the patients with early prosthetic valve endocarditis survived (all had severe hemodynamic compromise). We analyzed 18 factors for the prediction of early and late death. The predictors of death by univariate analysis for both early and late prosthetic valve endocarditis were age, diagnosis time, renal status, sepsis, management mode, fever, dental procedures, and dental prophylaxis. The predictors by multivariate analysis were age, diagnosis time, renal status, and management mode for early prosthetic valve endocarditis, and only diagnosis time for late prosthetic valve endocarditis. Annular abscess formation occurred in 27% of the patients. There were no complex aortic or mitral reconstructions. There was one reoperation for recurrent and residual endocarditis. There was one late death as a result of recurrent prosthetic valve endocarditis. We advocate early diagnosis and aggressive combined medical and surgical treatment before the development of hemodynamic compromise and other characteristic signs when the culprit organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative organisms, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Endocarditis in Ethiopia. Analysis of 51 cases from Addis Ababa.
AB  - Fifty-one cases of infective endocarditis in 47 Ethiopians over several years are analyzed. There were 32 males and 19 females, average age was 20.5, with 34 < or = 20. Only 2 patients had a known source of infection. Forty-four cases had underlying rheumatic heart disease, 7 had congenital heart disease of which 5 had patent ductus arteriosus. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were the most commonly cultured organisms (10 each), only 1 streptococcus was isolated; 28/47 cultured cases had negative cultures. Eight patients (16%) died. In comparison with western studies, this group was much younger and had a higher prevalence of rheumatic heart disease. Mitral valve prolapse and degenerative valvular disease common in the West were not seen in this population. The rate of negative cultures was much higher than the 5-10% reported in the west, most likely due to previous use of antibiotics and problems with culture techniques.
TI  - In vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. To evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at pH of 7.2. Clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. Methicillin-susceptible S aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. Cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against E coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus S pneumoniae. The gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against K pneumoniae and E coli. These results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible S aureus, K pneumoniae, and E coli. Prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. In murine systemic infections, FK037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA). It was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae, except Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except MRSA and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was more effective than cefpirome. These results correlated well with its in vitro activity. In murine local infections, with few exceptions, FK037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against Klebsiella pneumonia in ED50 values and against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with S. aureus and E. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. It is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of FK037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and P. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. In addition, the therapeutic effects of FK037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to MSSA, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for MSSA, 0.063 to 0.125 g for K. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for P. aeruginosa). FK037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with MSSA in neutropenic mice. These results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - The efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam in the therapy of bacteraemia.
AB  - The efficacy of the combination of piperacillin plus tazobactam was studied in 142 patients who had a bacteriologically proven bacteraemia. Seventy-three patients were bacteriologically evaluable and, of these, 55 had a follow-up blood culture; there was no follow-up culture in the other 18 patients, so that any cure could only be presumptive. Of the 55 patients who were fully followed up, 32 received only piperacillin and tazobactam and 23 also received an aminoglycoside. Overall, there were 67 cures and six failures out of 73 evaluable cases (three Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and one Streptococcus bovis). There were 11 deaths, eight of which occurred in neutropenic patients. In no case was death drug related. Side-effects were mild; the commonest adverse events noted were mild elevations of liver enzymes. Piperacillin plus tazobactam appeared efficacious and safe in the therapy of bacteraemia.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - Study of the antiseptic efficacy of a quick drying rubbing type povidone-iodine alcoholic disinfectant solution by the glove juice method.
AB  - The antiseptic efficacy of HAD Hand Wash (83% ethanol containing 0.5% povidone-iodine) was investigated by the glove-juice method in 29 cases amongst staff members of our university. The number of viable bacteria on the hands and fingers was counted three times, and the mean of these counts was used as the baseline value for each subject. The number of viable bacteria on both hands was the same prior to disinfection. After the hands were disinfected by rubbing with 3 ml of HAD Hand Wash until it dried, the subjects put on sterile gloves. The number of viable bacteria was counted on the right hand of all the subjects immediately after disinfection. The number of viable bacteria on the left hand was counted in 8 subjects 30 minutes after disinfection, and in 7 subjects each 1, 2 and 4 hours after disinfection. The bacteria were identified by subculture. The ratio of bacteria sterilized (bacterial reduction rate) was 75.4% immediately after disinfection, and 69.0%, 71.9%, 35.8% and 27.6% at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours, respectively. All of the bacteria detected were Gram-positive bacteria that were native to the sebaceous glands, sweat glands or skin surface; i.e. Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Bacillus, and Streptococcus. The frequency of detection of Staphylococcus warneri was the highest before disinfection, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis, in that order. After disinfection, all these species showed a marked decrease in the number of bacteria. Micrococcus remained in half the subjects, while other species remained in less than one third of the subjects.
TI  - Cefdinir: in vitro activity study and effect of human serum.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefdinir (Cl-983, FK482), an orally absorbed aminothiazole cephalosporin, was compared with that of penicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (2/1), cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefotaxime, vancomycin and erythromycin against 370 clinical isolates of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Cefdinir was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, inhibiting 90% of the strains at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. However, cefdinir was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (range 16- > 128 mg/l). The respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes were also susceptible (MIC90 < or = 0.5 mg/l), but against Enterococcus spp. cefdinir displayed no useful activity. The common members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/l), but those possessing chromosomal beta-lactamases were more resistant (MIC90 2-8 mg/l). The presence of human serum had little effect on MICs of cefdinir. These results indicate that cefdinir exhibited a wide spectrum for an oral cephalosporin and support its possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in infections of the skin, soft tissue, respiratory and urinary tracts.
TI  - [Etiology of bacterial endocarditis in materials from Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Clinics of the Lodz Academy].
AB  - In the years 1986-1991, 72 cases of bacterial endocarditis (BE) were investigated. The bacteria were isolated from blood in 24 cases, from native and artificial valves obtained during surgery in 24 cases, and from both blood and valves in 6 cases. Following microorganisms were isolated: S. epidermidis, S. xylosus, S. hominis, S. aureus, Micrococcus sp., S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, M. lacunata, E. adecarboxylata, P. maltophila, Corynebacterium sp., A. calcoaceticus var. lwoffii, and Aspergillus sp. Gram-positive bacteria were prevailing among isolated strains. Staphylococci were present in 55.7% (29 cases) and among them coagulase-negative staphylococci occurred in 89.7% (26 cases). Streptococci were isolated from 9 patients (17.3%) and Gram-negative rods from 5 patients (9.65%). Coryneform bacteria were detected in 7 cases (13.5%). There was no relation between type of removed valve and colonizing it bacteria. From native and artificial valves coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated, respectively, in 48.3% and 52.2%. Susceptibility of isolated bacteria to 27 antibiotics was determined. Multiple resistant strains were present most frequently among staphylococci.
TI  - Clinical studies of oral quinolone once daily in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were studied. The most common species recovered from the sputum specimens of these patients were Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram positive cocci unidentified, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Morexella catarrhalis, Streptococcus epidermidis, and another Haemophilus species in this order. All these bacteria were susceptible to ofloxacin except for one strain of methicillin resistant S. aureus. A satisfactory clinical outcome was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%). It is concluded that ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, is useful for patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to exocellular  proteins of Staphylococcus aureus in bone infection.
AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for measurement of the antibody response to exocellular protein antigens of Staphylococcus aureus. The wells of a microtitre plate were coated with the exocellular proteins present in the tryptic soya broth growth medium from a stationary phase culture of a bone infection strain of S. aureus. The wells were then reacted sequentially with patient sera, protein A-peroxidase conjugate and chromogenic substrate. Serum from patients with S. aureus bone infection gave a significantly higher IgG titre than sera from patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Streptococcus sanguis bone infection or healthy uninfected individuals. The assay therefore appears to have potential in the serodiagnosis of S. aureus bone infection.
TI  - Infections of the central nervous system.
AB  - Infections of the central nervous system are common, serious medical conditions.  One hundred consecutive adult cases with purulent meningitis of known etiology encountered by the Medical Service at Parkland Memorial Hospital were reviewed. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (56 cases), followed by Neisseria meningitidis (16 cases) and Listeria monocytogenes (seven cases). Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci each accounted for five cases. An additional 15 patients had purulent meningitis with a pathogen being isolated. Twenty five purulent meningitis cases of known etiology after trauma or neurosurgery were reviewed. Staphylococcus aureus (five cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (four cases), and gram negative bacilli (14 cases) were the most common pathogens. Review of intracranial suppurative infections demonstrated advances in microbiology, antibiotic therapy, and imaging, leading to improvements in therapy. Subdural empyema continues to be a difficult diagnosis to make and apparently is related to the anatomic pathology of the infectious process. To illustrate salient features about granulomatous meningitis and encephalitis, cases of tuberculous meningitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and encephalitis of undetermined etiology are presented and discussed.
TI  - [Infective endocarditis: analysis of 300 episodes].
AB  - PURPOSE: Study of clinical features and etiologic agents, treatment and mortality of patients with infective endocarditis (IE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 300 episodes of IE occurring in 288 patients, ages ranged between 0.2 and 78 (mean 30.76) years; 185 (62%) episodes occurred in males. RESULTS: a) etiologic agents: viridans group streptococci in 93 (31%) episodes, enterococci en 21 (7%), group D-non enterococci in 19 (6%) (13 S. bovis), other streptococci in 14 (5%), Staphylococcus aureus in 59 (20%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 14 (5%), gram-negative bacteria in 16 (5%), gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci and staphylococci and staphylococci in 8 (3%), fungi in 4 (1%). The etiologic agents were not identified in 52 (17%) episodes; b) underlying cardiac diseases: valvular heart disease in 119 (40%) episodes, congenital heart disease in 37 (12%), prosthetic heart valves in 69 (23%), other heart diseases in 6 (2%). There was no evidence of previous heart disease in 69 (23%); c) treatment: surgical treatment was undertaken in 102 (34%) episodes. The frequency of surgical treatment in relation to the etiologic agents ranged between 1% (non-group D streptococcus) and 62% (negative blood cultures). The frequency of operation in relation to underlying heart disease ranged between 17% (other heart diseases), 19% (congenital heart disease) and 54% (prosthetic heart valve); d) mortality: 78 (26%) patients died, 56 (28%) of the 198 submitted to medical treatment and 22 (21%) of the 102 submitted also to surgical treatment. The mortality in the different groups of etiologic agents ranged between 5% (non group D streptococcus) and 62% (gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci ans staphylococci); in relation to the underlying with other heart disease, 19% in valvular heart disease patients, 21% in patients with congenital heart disease, 23% in patients without known heart disease and 43% in patients with prosthetic heart valves. CONCLUSION: The mortality associated with IE remains still high in spite of modern treatment; the mortality is different in relation to the cardiac status before the IE.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - The incidence of bacteraemia following laryngeal mask insertion.
AB  - The incidence of bacteraemia following insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was investigated in one hundred fit patients. Four cultures were positive: three represented contamination with skin flora; the other was a microaerophilic streptococcus grown from an anaerobic culture bottle. Although this organism can be pathogenic, it may also represent contamination. Our findings suggest that significant bacteraemia on insertion of the LMA is uncommon and is probably no more than with oral intubation. Antibiotic prophylaxis is of doubtful benefit in these circumstances.
TI  - Evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  - To investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. All mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. At 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The day of inoculation was designated Day 0. On Day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded P. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus morbillorum. On Days 6, 7 and 8, Group A mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. Group B mares received infusions of saline only. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in Group A than Group B mares on Days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). Swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in Group A yielded growth of fungi on Days 13 and 19. Mares in Group B were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on Days 19, 20 and 21. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on Days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not recovered from these mares at any time. The incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in Group A and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Sulbactam-ampicillin in surgery. Our experience].
AB  - The bacterial infections constitute a serious problem for the surgeon: the choice of antibiotic drugs is really important and, as often as possible, should be guided by antibiotic sensitivity tests. In this study we used sulbactam-ampicillin (Unasyn) who is an antibiotic combination between sulbactam, inhibitor of beta lactam and ampicillin. The preliminary results were as follows: Unasyn was administered to 21 hospitalized selected patients, 16 women and 5 man, who had clinical signs of intraabdominal infection, wound infection and subphrenic abscess after digestive surgery. In these patients were isolated the following organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis (8), Staphylococcus aureus (11), serratia (1), streptococcus (3), E. coli (3). The daily dosage of Unasyn was 3-12 g/die administered in three to four divided doses, and was determined by the severity of infection, the antibiotic susceptibility of the causative organism(s) and the condition of the patient. Each dose was given by slow i.v. infusion in 15-30 minutes. Our success rate was 100%, and neither systemic nor local side effects were recorded.
TI  - Correlation between the in vivo and in vitro antimicrobial properties of commercially available mouthwash preparations.
AB  - The effectiveness of six commercially available mouthwashes against common buccal organisms was studied. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for two of the studied mouthwashes (Corsodyl and Oraldene) against buccal organisms were determined in Todd Hewitt medium with or without 5% serum. The concentration of the active substance in these two mouthwashes was in excess of the corresponding MIC. When the medium was supplemented with serum, lower MIC values were observed. Kill-time determinations, used at half the concentration of the normal preparation, revealed a rapid lethal effect for all tested mouthwashes. The slowest lethal effect was observed with Fluocaril mouthwash. When mouthwashes were tested in volunteers, an immediate significant fall in salivary bacterial counts was produced by all except Fluocaril. With the latter mouthwash the decrease was significant 2-30 minutes after rinsing. The bacterial levels returned to pre-rinse levels after 30 minutes for Listerine, after 90 minutes for both Oraldene and Mint and after 180 minutes for Corsodyl, Fluocaril and Sansilla mouthwashes. The results indicate that there is a good correlation between in vivo efficacy and in vitro determination of all mouthwash preparations.
TI  - Comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the pH responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  - Comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in pH than does glucose. In vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. Pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no pH response with this sugar. This suggested that the smaller decreases in pH seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. Variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. In the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose pH responses. These showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the pH by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. The effects were different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. The corresponding acid-base pH profiles for pure cultures were different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of paper money].
AB  - Bacteriological survey of one hundred twenty currency notes was done. Aerobic spore-forming bacilli (91%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (63.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.2%), Enterococcus (24.1%), alpha-hem. streptococcus (4.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.7%), Corynebacterium (7.5%), Lactobacilli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), Enterobacter (19.2%), E. coli (17.5%), Proteus (1.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.8%), Shigella flexneri (0.8%) were isolated from paper money samples. Currency notes in general were bacteriologically contaminated especially with enteric pathogens and potentially pathogens, it was thought that some measures have to be taken to reduce these ill effects.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - MHC-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
AB  - A CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ T cell clone (A35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. This clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. There was no restriction by polymorphic parts of HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules and a HLA class II-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected HLA class I-deficient cells (Daudi cells) were not. The clone showed crossreaction between Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. MAb to CD2, CD3, and CD8 efficiently blocked A35, whereas the addition of mAb to HLA class II or to HLA class I did not. This clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Endophthalmitis following extracapsular cataract surgery: a review of 32 cases.
AB  - Thirty two cases of endophthalmitis following extracapsular cataract surgery that had occurred within our department and had undergone intraocular diagnostic tap between May 1982 and May 1991 were reviewed. An infectious agent was identified in 20 cases (62.5%). The commonest organism was Staphylococcus epidermidis (11 cases) (55%). Proteus was the only gram negative organism identified (four cases) (20%). Both of these organisms were associated with a favourable visual outcome. In the culture positive subgroup 15 eyes (75%) achieved a final acuity of 6/60 or better with 10 eyes (50%) gaining 6/12 or better. Thirteen (65%) of the culture positive cases were managed without vitreal intervention. Of these 11 (85%) achieved 6/60 or better with eight (62%) gaining 6/12 or better. It appears that when an endophthalmitis follows uncomplicated extracapsular cataract surgery delivery of antibiotic by the 'conventional' routes (topical, subconjunctival and systemic) is consistent with a favourable visual result in many cases. A modified anterior chamber diagnostic tap technique is described.
TI  - [Surgical treatment of active infective endocarditis and prosthetic valve endocarditis].
AB  - Fifteen patients with active native valve endocarditis (NVE) and 5 with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) were subjected to this study. Among the patients with NVE, one of 10 with simple destruction of leaflets and 2 of 5 with annular infection died postoperatively of cerebral bleeding and persistent infection. Five patients with annular infection, whose microorganisms were Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative coccus, had a shorter duration from onset to operation (mean 38 days) compared with the others (mean 85 days). A patient with NVE requires an urgent operation, especially when these microorganisms are identified. Among those with PVE, 3 underwent operation at the active phase and one at the chronic phase. Two patients with mechanical valve endocarditis by Staphylococcus and Candida died, but the other 2 with bioprosthetic valve endocarditis by alpha-Streptococcus survived, because infection was localized in the leaflets. Another patient with mechanical valve endocarditis by alpha-Streptococcus survived with conservative management. While a patient with bioprosthetic valve endocarditis requires an early operation as well as NVE, a patient with mechanical valve endocarditis requires selected management considering the microorganism and general condition.
TI  - Studies on azopyrazole derivatives. Part 9: Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel phenylhydrazones and their substituted 4-arylazopyrazole derivatives.
AB  - 6-Methyl-2,4-heptandione (1) was coupled with diazonium salts of sulfanilamide (2) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (3). Resulting new hydrazones, namely 4-methyl-2-oxovaleraldehyde p-substituted phenylhydrazones 4 and 5, were refluxed with various hydrazines to synthesize the title compounds 6-15. Their structure elucidation was made on the basis of their analytical and spectroscopic data. The antibacterial activity was evaluated. Some of the compounds tested exerted moderate to potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - [Surgical treatment of native valve endocarditis].
AB  - Twenty eight patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) were subjected to this study. Thirteen patients underwent an operation at the chronic phase, and 15 patients at the active phase. One of the 13 patients at the chronic phase died of cardiac rupture due to myocardial infarction which had occurred preoperatively, and one of 10 patients at active phase without annular infection died of rupture of mycotic cerebral aneurysm early postoperatively. Among 5 patients at the active phase with annular infection, prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred in one patient 1.5 months after supraannular aortic valve replacement, and the second operation with a translocation technique was needed. This patient was lost from low output syndrome. Another patient in this group, who underwent a translocation technique because of mycotic annular abscess, died of intestinal infarction late postoperatively. The other 24 patients went a good postoperative course. Five patients with annular infection at the active phase had a shorter duration from the infectious onset to operation (20 days to 2 months, average 38 days), and the causative microorganisms were streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative coccus. One patient, who died of mycotic cerebral aneurysmal rupture, had candida albicans as a causative microorganism. For patients with NVE, an early aggressive operation is essential before infection extends to the annulus or to other vital organs, especially when these microorganisms are identified.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin RP 59500.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of RP 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. A 30 min exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a PAE of 3.2-8 h. A 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a PAE of 2.5-7.5 h. PAEs of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the PAEs of highly susceptible isolates. A 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 7.5-9.5 h for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a PAE of greater than 18 h for Streptococcus pyogenes. RP 59500 produced a longer PAE with Staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. These results suggest that RP 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - Nosocomial bacterial infections in very low birth weight infants.
AB  - The occurrence of congenital and nosocomial bacterial septicaemia has been documented by identifying the number of positive blood cultures by reviewing the laboratory and clinical records of 394 very low birth weight infants who were consecutively admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit over a 40-month period. The incidence of congenital septicaemia was 6% and of nosocomial septicaemia 17%. The commonest causes of congenital infection were Streptococcus agalactiae Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis (each in 18% of cases). The commonest cause of nosocomial infection was S. epidermidis (51% of cases), except in infants of birth weight less than 750 g. Risk factors for nosocomial infection were extremely low birth weight, very preterm birth and prolonged ventilation. Nosocomial infection was associated with significantly lengthened hospital admission.
TI  - Lethal Fournier's gangrene following vasectomy.
AB  - A case is presented of a healthy young man who had Fournier's gangrene after standard bilateral vasectomy. Despite maximal treatment, including extensive necrectomy and broad-spectrum antibiotics, this complication was lethal. To our knowledge a lethal complication of vasectomy has not been reported in the literature.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, was compared with the activities of other fluoroquinolones. OPC-17116 inhibited 50% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. At less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited, which was comparable to or better than the activities of fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin but less than the activity of ciprofloxacin. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of the staphylococci tested at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Group A, B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, being four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Tosufloxacin was the most active agent tested against gram-positive cocci. OPC-17116 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 4 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal effect of inoculum size on MIC, and the MBCs were within 1 dilution of the MICs. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased at pH 6 and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations, but it was unaffected by human serum. OPC-17116 showed a postantibiotic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus similar to the postantibiotic effects reported for other fluoroquinolones. The frequency of spontaneous single-step resistance was low (less than 10(-9)), but repeated passage of organisms in the presence of OPC-17116 resulted in the selection of resistant isolates.
TI  - Aspirin to prevent growth of vegetations and cerebral emboli in infective endocarditis.
AB  - The incidence of stroke on cranial computed tomography (CT) and change in echocardiographic vegetation area was prospectively compared in a preliminary observational study involving nine patients with infective endocarditis randomized to either low-dose aspirin (75 mg d-1, Group I, n = 4) or no aspirin (Group II, n = 5). Two symptomatic cerebral infarcts and one myocardial infarct occurred in the controls, compared to no events in patients on aspirin during a total observation period of 343 d (range 28-49 d). The mean vegetation area decreased in the aspirin group (mean change = -0.24 cm2), compared to an increase in controls (mean change = +0.35 cm2). The platelet half-life (normal range 5-6 d), which was measured using Indium-111 radiolabelling, tended to be lower in Group II (4.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.5 d). No side-effects or complications attributable to aspirin were observed. A possible role for adjunctive aspirin therapy in the prevention of embolic complications in infective endocarditis is suggested, and warrants further study.
TI  - The bacteriology of bone allografts.
AB  - We report the contamination rate in the Cambridge bone bank of 35 consecutive allograft specimens, all harvested in a clean-air environment, using a strict aseptic technique and antibiotic cover. Five of 27 femoral heads taken from living donors and three of eight massive allografts taken from cadavers were found to be contaminated. The contaminated femoral heads were discarded. All massive allografts were rendered sterile by gamma-irradiation. It is important to exclude bacteriological contamination of harvested and banked bone.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  - The activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. Decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. Decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, group C and G streptococci, with an MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. It was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml). The activity of decaplanin against enterococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. Decaplanin was active from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Inoculum size had a minimal effect on MICs, and increased concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter MICs or MBCs.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Septic ischial bursitis in patients with spinal cord injury.
AB  - Septic ischial bursitis is described in 4 patients with spinal cord injury. In these patients a pre-existing ischial bursitis probably became secondarily infected. Because these patients lack sensation, diagnosis may be difficult. The disease process in one patient with a prolonged fever was only recognized after a leucocyte scan detected an abscess extending to the thigh. At surgery it was found that the infection extended from the ischial bursa to the upper lateral thigh. Infection in these patients was due to beta hemolytic streptococcus, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis. The patients all responded well to local drainage and excision of the bursa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  - Although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the species in question are not adequately known. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. Using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes. It was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in B lymphocytes. The polyclonal activation of B cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in Gram-negative anaerobes. Furthermore, all of the tested species excluding Bacteroides oralis were poor T cell mitogens. These findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. It thus seems plausible that a battery of complex immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activities of three semisynthetic amide derivatives of teicoplanin, MDL  62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873.
AB  - MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873 are three semisynthetic amide derivatives of  teicoplanin (MDL 62208 is an amide of teicoplanin aglycone, MDL 62211 is an amide of the teicoplanin A2 complex, and MDL 62873 is the corresponding derivative of peak A2-2 of the complex). The three semisynthetic glycopeptides were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity in comparison with the parent drug (teicoplanin) and vancomycin. A variety of gram-positive bacteria of clinical origin, whose species were carefully determined and that included 428 staphylococci (207 methicillin susceptible and 221 methicillin resistant), 41 streptococci, 82 enterococci, 43 strains of Listeria monocytogenes, 10 JK coryneform bacteria, and 67 anaerobes belonging to the genera Clostridium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Eubacterium, were tested. The only resistances to MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873 were encountered with vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterococci. All of the other test strains, including some teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci of the species Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were highly susceptible to the three teicoplanin amides. Only minor differences in activity were observed among MDL 62208, MDL 62211, and MDL 62873, whereas the three experimental compounds were usually found to be more potent than teicoplanin or vancomycin (especially against staphylococci, with differences mostly ranging from 2- to 16-fold). The MBC-to-MIC ratios varied depending on the organisms, with the highest ratios usually observed for enterococci and listeriae. Overall, the MBC-to-MIC ratios yielded by the teicoplanin analogs were slightly greater than those yielded by teicoplanin or vancomycin.
TI  - The relevance of cultures of catheter-drawn blood and heparin-lock fluid to diagnose infection in hematologic patients.
AB  - The results of bacteriologic cultures of blood and heparin-lock fluid, both drawn from the central venous catheters of 54 consecutive oncohematologic patients, have been used to determine their value for the diagnosis of systemic and catheter-associated infection. In 30 patients with clinical signs of infection (bacteremia or septicemia), 74 of 1000 (7.4%) heparin-lock fluid cultures, 114 of 542 (21%) catheter-drawn blood cultures, and 36 of 134 (26%) venipuncture blood cultures became positive, whereas in 24 patients without clinical signs of infection the respective values were 5 of 700 (0.7%), one of 220 (0.4%), and none of ten cultures. Comparison of the results of cultures sampled on the same day reveals that the positive and negative predictive values for catheter-drawn blood cultures, with the venipuncture blood cultures taken as the standard for bacteremia, are 82% and 95% respectively. The results of heparin-lock fluid are indicative for clinically relevant colonization of the catheter. Three or more positive heparin-lock fluid cultures, sampled on subsequent days, were correlated with the occurrence of bacteremia or septicemia with a positive predictive value of 100%. The conclusions are supported by the results of scanning electron microscopy.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  - Using the D value method of analysis, we evaluated the relative antimicrobial effectiveness of eight contact lens disinfection solutions against a standard population of challenge organisms as defined in the Microbiological Guidelines proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Six bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens) and two fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) were investigated. The disinfectants included hydrogen peroxide (AOSept, MiraSept, Oxysept), chlorine-based solutions (Aerotab and Softab), soaking solutions containing synthetic, high molecular weight preservatives (ReNu and Opti-Free) and a thimerosal preserved soaking solution (Hydrocare Cleaning and Soaking Solution). The one-step hydrogen peroxide system (AOSept) was evaluated both with and without the catalytic disk. To facilitate comparison of the disinfecting solutions, we defined a new measure of performance, namely "power" of solution. This has an advantage over the "safety factor" because the solution power is independent of the size of the initial inoculum. Because different approaches to analysis may yield a wide range of D values for one set of survival data we call for adoption of a standardized approach. Our results suggest that one of the chlorine-based solutions fails to meet the FDA recommendations for bacterial challenge. Most solutions performed poorly against mycotic challenge. However, when used over longer disinfecting periods, 3% hydrogen peroxide and the Hydrocare solution gave adequate performance against fungi.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - Septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  - 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus species and Pneumococcus) and 41% Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter). Compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Thus, a shift from a predominating Gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating Gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. In both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with Gram-negative septicemia, especially in patients with a Ps, aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Organisms in the prostate and antibiotics in the treatment of postoperative infections.
AB  - On 24 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with preoperatively sterile urine, who also had no history of urinary tract infection, the organisms in the prostate obtained through transurethral resection as well as in the anterior urethra were isolated. In 17 patients out of 24, organisms obtained in the prostate were identical to those in the anterior urethra; therefore, it can be concluded that another 7 patients had organisms in the prostate itself before the operation. These results would suggest that sterile urine did not indicate sterile prostate and that organisms in the prostate did not always ascend from the urethra. In the patients who preoperatively received transurethral catheterizations, Streptococcus faecalis was the most predominantly isolated organism in the prostate, which was highly sensitive to ABPC and minocycline and lower to cephems. On the other hand, in the patients with no history of catheterizations, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated one, which was highly sensitive to ABPC and minocycline as well as cephems. So, in the treatment of the cases with infectious symptoms after transurethral resection of the prostate, ABPC or minocycline should be selected as first-choice drugs rather than cephems.
TI  - The comparative activity of fleroxacin, three other quinolones and eight unrelated antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. Fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The MICs of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of Enterobacteriaceae except Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) and Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). Fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against Pseudomonas spp, (MIC90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). Acinetobacter and Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against Acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against H. influenzae. Methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). In addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against Enterococcus spp. (MIC90 > 8 micrograms/ml). Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. These results suggest that fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most Enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.
TI  - [Bacterial endophthalmitis. Ophthalmological results of a national multicenter prospective survey].
AB  - Under the aegis of the GEEP (Groupement d'Etudes Epidemiologiques et Prophylactiques) a prospective multicentre study concerning bacterial endophthalmitis was carried out over a period of one year long with the contribution of 64 metropolitan ophthalmologic hospital departments. During this survey 143 cases of post surgical endophthalmitis were recorded: 111 of them were secondary to elective surgery, 32 developed after a perforating eye injury. Twenty-four cases of endophthalmitis developed in the absence of surgery were therefore called "medical" endophthalmitis. The frequency of endophthalmitis after elective surgery was 0.32%, and 2.8% after penetrating eye injury. Intraocular samples were obtained in 61.5% of the cases of post surgical endophthalmitis. 53 bacteria were isolated from 50 cases of endophthalmitis. The bacterial nature of the endophthalmitis was proved in 35% of these cases of post surgical endophthalmitis. Bacteria isolated from these cases of post surgical endophthalmitis were gram positive in 86.7%, and gram negative in 13.3% of cases. 20 bacteria were isolated from pseudophakic eyes: 10 of them were Staphylococcus epidermidis. The visual prognosis of endophthalmitis depends on the strain: visual acuity was more than 1/10 in 68% of cases of Staphylococcus endophthalmitis infection, but in only in 7% of cases of Streptococcus endophthalmitis infection. Intraocular injections of antibiotics both in the anterior chamber and in the vitreous, and vitrectomy increased the quality of the visual result. Three months after post surgical endophthalmitis, 35% of those eyes who received systemic and periocular antibiotic therapy, combined with intraocular antibiotics, with or without vitrectomy, recovered a visual acuity of 4/10 or more, instead of only 18% in the group without any intraocular therapy.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Ofloxacin versus cephalexin in the treatment of skin, skin structure, and soft-tissue infections in adults.
AB  - A multicenter study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of oral ofloxacin with that of cephalexin in microbiologic eradication of skin and skin-structure pathogens and the clinical treatment of skin and skin-structure infections. The subjects, 335 adult patients with acute localized infections of the skin, skin structure, or soft tissue, were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of ofloxacin orally every 12 hours or 500 mg of cephalexin orally every six hours for 10 days. At admission, 398 aerobic pathogens were isolated, the most common being Staphylococcus aureus (160 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (49), coagulase-negative staphylococci (30), Staphylococcus epidermidis (25), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10). Of 317 isolates tested against ofloxacin, 96% were susceptible, and of 325 tested against cephalexin, 85% were susceptible (P less than 0.001). Microbiologic and clinical outcome were evaluated in 73 ofloxacin-treated patients and in 65 cephalexin-treated patients. The causative pathogens were eradicated in 95% of the ofloxacin group and in 92% of the cephalexin group. In the ofloxacin group, 75% were clinically cured and 23% improved, and in the cephalexin group, 74% and 23%, respectively. Drug-related adverse experiences were reported by 14% of the 161 ofloxacin-treated patients and by 11% of the 162 cephalexin-treated patients; gastrointestinal disturbances were reported by 8% and 7% and nervous system effects by 6% and 1%, respectively (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that both ofloxacin and cephalexin are safe and effective in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Electron microscopic studies of endotracheal tubes used in neonates: do microbes  adhere to the polymer?
AB  - Fourteen neonates intubated at birth for 1-16 days had a microbiological follow up. After removal, tubes were examined using electron microscopy. Tubes became covered with a slimy accretion from the third day in place, independently of bacterial colonization, which was, in all but one cases, restricted to the rough areas of the tubes. Only Candida albicans and the corresponding slimy coat were found on smooth areas of tube. Cocci were noticed on 3 tubes. They were associated with the slimy accretion. Transmission micrographs elicited a thick material that was lying between cocci and polymer. These results showed that, on neonates' endotracheal tubes, accretion occurred independently of microbial colonization and that when colonization occurred, cocci adhered preferentially to a biological coat of human origin rather than the medical devices.
TI  - Clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  - In a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). Twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. The lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and CIEP. CIEP was done to detect the bacterial antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. Low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. Altogether, a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). In 10 babies, Strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. Micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. Eleven babies (25%) grew Gram negative bacteria. The common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were Strep. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinatobacter lowfii, Staph. aureus, Pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. All the Gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. All staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Maternal morbidity after abdominal cesarean section in relation to bacterial amniotic fluid colonization and premature rupture of fetal membranes].
AB  - At the time of Caesarean section, amniotic fluid was collected transabdominally from 1025 patients. In 990 patients cultures were performed on the amniotic fluid. The incidence of Caesarean section of all patients was 16.1%, the perinatal mortality in all patients 0.61%, in cases of Caesarean section 1.93%. The influence of bacterial colonisation in the amniotic cavity was analyzed with respect to premature ruptured membranes and frequency of vaginal examinations on the maternal post-operative morbidity (wound-seroma and abscess 2.4%, febrile morbidity 17%, urinary tract infection 19%). Bacterial contamination was present in 33.3% of the amniotic fluid or uterine cavity, after ruptured membranes in 44.3%, without ruptured membranes in 23.35%. There is a significant influence of the positive cultured amniotic fluid on the wound healing and on the febrile morbidity, while the urinary tract infection has been not influenced. The bacterial contamination of the amniotic fluid is correlated to the frequency of vaginal examination and the presence of ruptured membranes. The following microbiologic isolates were found in the amniotic fluids: Staphylococcus epidermidis 36.38%, Streptococcus B 12.23%, Streptococcus D 10.3%, Escherichia coli 8.42%, Staphylococcus aureus 7.88%, Peptococci 3.26%, Streptococcus salivarius 2.99%, Bacteroides 2.4%. According to these data, patients with ruptured membranes of an interval of more than 12 hrs and with more than 7 vaginal examinations could be selected for antibiotic prophylaxis to achieve a reduction in febrile morbidity and in wound infection.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Comparative efficacies of soft contact lens disinfectant solutions against microbial films in lens cases.
AB  - Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Candida albicans, established in the wells of a polyethylene contact lens case, retained viability to certain soft contact lens disinfectant solutions after exposure for the manufacturer's minimum recommended disinfection times. The relative order of resistance of bacterial biofilms was as follows: S marcescens was greater than P aeruginosa, which was greater than S epidermidis, which was greater than S pyogenes. Air drying of biofilms for 10 hours increased the efficacy of the disinfectant solutions, but drying was not enough to decrease the incidence of recovery to 0% for all solutions. Hydrogen peroxide was more effective against biofilms than disinfectant solutions formulated with chlorhexidine gluconate or polyquaternium-1 or polyaminopropyl biguanide. We recommend that determination of efficacy of contact lens disinfectant solutions should include challenges against biofilms.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - Treatment of posttraumatic osteitis with intravenous ofloxacin.
AB  - The subjects were 25 patients with osteomyelitis (n = 17) or other bone or joint  infections, scheduled for surgical procedures, including debridement, sequestrectomy, and bone resection and reconstruction. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 22 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus haemolyticus in one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, and a Pasteurella species in one. During surgery and for a mean of four days after surgery, each patient received 200 mg of ofloxacin intravenously twice daily (one patient received 300 mg and another received 400 mg twice daily). The patients were then given 200 mg of ofloxacin orally twice daily until the wound was healed (after a mean of 18 days). The wound was healed in all patients and no cases of reinfection occurred. It is concluded that intravenous ofloxacin given perioperatively may be more effective than oral ofloxacin in the management of osteomyelitis.
TI  - [Survey of fungi and bacterinum of the conjunctival sac in Guangzhou area].
AB  - This paper presents the results of fungal culture from healthy conjunctival sac in 178 eyes. The rate of positive culture of the fungi was 25% in farmers, 11.1% in cleaners, and 8.8% in city residents respectively. Culture for aerobic was carried out in the samples from conjunctival sacs of 137 eyes. The rate of positive culture was 71.9% in farmers, 80.6% in cleaners, and 23.2% in city residents respectively. On the other hand, the rate of fungal positive culture was 9.7% and that of aerobic was 30% in the patients managed with steroid eyedrops for more than one month. The aspergillus and penicillium were the most commonly seen species among the isolated fungal strain, whereas the staphylococci and streptococcus pneumonia were the most common among the isolated aerobic. The results run parallel to the fact that the main pathogens of ocular infection seen clinically are fungi and aerobics. The authors emphasize that the conjunctival sac should be disinfected to prevent infections caused by opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - [Common pathogens in burn infection and changes in their drug sensitivity].
AB  - This paper reports common pathogens in burn infection and changes in their drug sensitivity from 1985 to 1988. Gram negative rods constituted 55.7% of all pathogens, while 40.5% were gram positive cocci. The former group consisted of 173 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.5%), 55 Proteus (9.1%), 33 Serratia (5.4%), 23 Klebsiella (3.8%) 19, Acinetobacter (3.1%), 18 Enterobacter (3.0%) and 17 E. coli (2.8%). Among gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 32.8%, Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 5.6%, and Streptococcus faecalis accounted for 2.1%. All the gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci showed more resistance against various antibiotics. Ps. aeruginosa were resistant to 24 commonly used antibiotics. However, ciprofloxacin, ceftaztdime and piperacillin were comparatively effective, the sensitivity rates were 92.9%, 91.5% and 78.3%, respectively. Ps. aeruginosa showed a sensitivity rate of 92.5% and 86.1% to amikacin and polymyxin-B, respectively, from 1980 to 1984, but the rates were lowered to 65.9% and 17.3%, respectively, from 1985 to 1988. Staphylococcus aureus showed a sensitivity rate of 88.9% to ciprofloxacin, 76.1% to ceftazidime, 71.4% to amikacin, 48.5% to piperacillin, 63.1% to cefuroxime. This organism showed a sensitivity rate of 87.3%, 83.9%, 81.7% and 82.8% to amikacin, cefoperozone, leucomycin and lincomycin, respectively, from 1980 to 1984, but the sensitivity rates declined to 71.4%, 56.8%, 60.8% and 43.7%, respectively, from 1985 to 1988.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in an urological department. Incidence and etiological factors].
AB  - The authors report a prospective study with active request of data for nosocomial infections (NI) in an urological department during six months. From 453 patients, 43 developed an NI (incidence = 9.5%): urinary tract infections (53.5%), bloodstream infections (16.3%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), surgical wound infections (2.3%) and sepsis syndrome (20.9%). For microorganisms, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and E. coli (20%) were encountered. Other microorganisms were the next-ones: Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.5%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.5%), Streptococcus group D (7.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), Candida albicans (2.5%) and others (10%). Urological interventions with a high risk of NI were cystectomy with intestinal urinary diversion (68.7%), pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (40%) and percutaneous nephrolitothomy (30%). Even if the last two interventions classically do not have a high risk of NI, we think that their antibioprophylaxis is recommended.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - [Neonatal conjunctivitis in a nursery and a neonatal unit].
AB  - After Crede prophylaxis was abandoned at our hospital in 1984 scrupulous clinical surveillance of all neonates for conjunctivitis, and bacterial cultures from purulent eye discharge, have become routine. During the two-year period 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1989, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (EIA-technique) was added in all infants with clinical conjunctivitis. During the period concerned there were 332 cases of conjunctivitis among 4,520 live born infants, an incidence of 7.3%. The incidence was higher for infants staying in the nursery (8.2%) than for those admitted to the neonatal unit (3.5%) (p less than 0.01). 90% of the infections were diagnosed during the first week of life. 468 isolates were identified by routine bacteriological investigation, 452 gram-positives (96.6%), and 16 gram-negatives (3.4%). The following strains were found: Staphylococcus aureus 171 (51.5% of the patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis 153 (46.1%), Streptococcus viridans 106 (31.9%), diphteroids 11 (3.3%), beta-hemolytic streptococci seven (2.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae two (0.6%), enterococci two (0.6%), Hemophilus influenzae six (1.8%), Escherichia coli five (1.5%), Proteus two (0.6%) and Branhamella catarrhalis one (0.3%). Not a single case of gonococcal ophthalmia was diagnosed. Positive tests for Chlamydia were found in 13 infants (3.9% of all infants with conjunctivitis), an incidence of 0.3% for the whole population of live born infants. Six of the chlamydia infections (46%) occurred within the first week of life. Expenses for chlamydia testing were estimated to be NOK 1,020 per positive test. Preventing conjunctivitis in our nursery and neonatal unit calls for strategies to protect newborn infants from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, especially S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by oral streptococci against human carrier strains of staphylococci.
AB  - All strains of oral streptococci tested and specially those of Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sanguis and Strep. mitior produced more than one distinct bacteriocin-like substance with variable inhibitory activity on 20 indicator staphylococci. Inhibitory activity was comparatively higher on nasal strains of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis than on strains of both species isolated from the mouth. Nineteen of 20 staphylococcal indicators were inhibited by 1-12 of the 12 effector streptococci. Sensitivity of nasal staphylococci to bacteriocins (frequency of positive inhibitory tests and total inhibition zone diameters) was significantly higher (P less than 0.001, chi 2 test and P less than 0.05, t test respectively) than that of oral ones. The sensitivity of nasal over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) and of oral Staph. epidermidis over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05) was also significantly higher. The evaluation of variability of inhibitory patterns of bacteriocins produced by streptococci (p-typing), of sensitivity patterns of staphylococci to bacteriocins (s-typing) and of the significantly higher sensitivity of nasal over oral staphylococci to bacteriocins from the epidemiological and ecological viewpoints are discussed.
TI  - Bacterial colonisation of humidifier attachments on oxygen concentrators prescribed for long term oxygen therapy: a district review.
AB  - A microbiological survey was undertaken on the eight patients in the Liverpool District who have a humidifier attachment on their oxygen concentrator. All but one of the humidifiers were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Method and procedures in bacteriological study of necrotic teeth].
AB  - Research was conducted of 160 radicular canals with necrotic pulp. Results of different bacteriological analyses are presented. Culture analyses in aerobic and anaerobic media, resulted in the isolation of Staphylococcus Epidermidis, Streptococcus Viridans and Corynebacterium sp in the group studied, as the most frequent bacteria. There was no evidence of a specific germ linked with the pulp necrosis.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of burn blister fluid].
AB  - Under a sterilized technique the fluid of the unbroken blister was obtained for bacterial culture in 73 burned patients with different ages (5 months-67 Y) and extent of injury (1.5%-96% TBSA). Bacterial count was carried out if a positive result is obtained. Among the 73 patients, positive cultures were observed in 12, an incidence of 16.4%. Patients suffering from serious or extremely serious thermal injuries showed a positive culture rate of 15%. Bacterial count of the blister fluid appeared to be higher in patients with extensive burns. Most of the bacteria were common resident organisms of the human body. Of the 4 patients with their blister fluid bacteria counts over 2000 CFU/ml, 2 died from sepsis, while 8 patients with lower than 2000 CFU/ml bacteria in their blister fluid survived. The results suggested that large number of bacteria in the blister fluid might further depress local immunity, so that the patient is more susceptible to infections. It is therefore suggested that culture of blister fluid and bacterial count should be done immediately in the extensively burned patient just after admission.
TI  - Results of bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures from adult sickle cell disease patients with the acute chest syndrome.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of the acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease based on bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures and to describe the clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic features of the acute chest syndrome in a series composed entirely of adult patients with sickle cell disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the hospital records from 19 episodes (18 patients) of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease (greater than or equal to 19 years of age) who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy to obtain lower airway cultures between January 1979 and July 1987. We also recorded patients' clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic characteristics. RESULTS: Pneumonia was diagnosed in four of 19 episodes (21%) of acute chest syndrome based on quantitative cultures obtained at bronchoscopy. The pneumonia was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in two patients and mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the other two patients. Forty-four of 45 blood cultures were negative, and one grew Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was considered a contaminant. Chest roentgenograms revealed lower lobe involvement in 17 episodes (90%) and bilateral infiltrates in six (32%). Pleural effusions occurred in seven episodes (37%), and pleural fluid samples obtained from five of these revealed sterile exudates. CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective study suggest that bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon cause of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease. These results are consistent with previous retrospective studies using noninvasive techniques to diagnose pneumonia. Nevertheless, there appeared to be no reliable noninvasive variables that could accurately differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia and, consequently, we recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in addition to usual supportive care of these patients.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - The in-vitro and disc susceptibility testing of clarithromycin and its 14-hydroxy metabolite.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of clarithromycin, its 14-hydroxy metabolite  and a combination containing clarithromycin and the 14-hydroxy metabolite in a ratio of three parts of the former to one part of the latter were compared with erythromycin by determination of MICs. Disc susceptibility testing was also performed using discs containing 6 micrograms clarithromycin, 6 micrograms clarithromycin with 2 micrograms 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, 3 micrograms clarithromycin and 3 micrograms clarithromycin with 1 microgram 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin. This was to determine a suitable disc content and minimum zone diameter to distinguish between sensitive and resistant strains using a breakpoint of 4 mg/l clarithromycin. Clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, although the 14-hydroxy metabolite was more active against H. influenzae. The clarithromycin/14-hydroxy metabolite combination was most active against beta-haemolytic streptococci (Groups A-C) (mode MIC 0.06 mg/l). The parent compound and the combination were similarly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 0.12 mg/l). Branhamella catarrhalis was more susceptible to clarithromycin (MIC90 0.06) than to erythromycin (MIC90 0.25 mg/l). Activities of all compounds against S. epidermidis and enterococci were similar but against Neisseria species erythromycin was the more active compound. The 6 micrograms clarithromycin disc strength was found to give the most consistent results for all isolates. Using a breakpoint of 4 mg/l, minimum zone diameters indicative of sensitivity were as follows: 16 mm for staphylococci, 17 mm for respiratory pathogens and 11 mm for streptococci and Neisseria spp.
TI  - Epidemiologic characteristics, predisposing factors, and etiologic diagnosis of corneal ulceration in Nepal.
AB  - Corneal ulceration is one of the most frequent causes of blindness in developing  countries. Between September 1985 and August 1987, 405 patients with corneal ulceration were examined at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Males and females were equally affected. The most common predisposing cause of ulceration was corneal trauma, usually with organic agricultural materials. Microorganisms were grown from 324 (80%) of the ulcers. Pure bacterial cultures were obtained from 256 (63.2%) of the patients, whereas pure fungal cultures were obtained from 27 (6.7%) of the patients. In 41 patients (10.1%), corneal cultures yielded a mixed growth of bacteria and fungi. Of a total of 398 bacterial isolates, 124 (31.1%) were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most commonly isolated organism in the series. Other frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas species. Of 68 positive fungal isolates obtained, 32 (47.0%) were identified as Aspergillus species. Candida species and Fusarium species were less commonly seen.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of teicoplanin in gram-positive pulmonary infections.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a new antibiotic obtained from a culture filtrate of Actinoplanes  teichomyceticus with potent activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria and having a high affinity for healthy or inflamed bronchial mucosa and pulmonary parenchyma. To investigate the efficacy and safety of this drug, we selected 13 patients suffering from lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-positive organisms. Pathogens isolated from sputum or bronchial aspirate were: 8 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 1 Streptococcus species. We began treatment as monotherapy at the dosage of 400 mg daily (200 mg x 2) I.M. only after microbiological evaluation. 11 patients (84.6%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured, 1 (7.7%) showed definite clinical improvement but persistence of causative agent and 1 (7.7%) failed to respond. The mean treatment period was 8.3 days. No major adverse effect was observed. We conclude that teicoplanin is a very efficacious and well-tolerated antibiotic for therapy of gram-positive pulmonary infections.
TI  - [Changes in the composition and properties of the microflora in abscesses and phlegmons of the maxillofacial area].
AB  - The authors have analyzed wound microflora composition and characteristics in 422 patients with maxillofacial phlegmons and abscesses, treated over a period of 25 years (1963-1988). They have examined the microbiologic structure in these conditions in various years. Their findings evidence a gradual reduction of the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and a significant elevation of the detection rate of gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (63.9 percent).
TI  - Antibacterial effects of zinc oxide, rosin, and resin acids with special reference to their interactions.
AB  - The growth inhibiting capacity of zinc oxide combined with ordinary rosin (Portuguese rosin), abietic acid or dehydroabietic acid was studied using two different methods. To mimic the actual treatment of wounds, circular tapes or sensitivity discs were placed on Muller-Hinton-agar plates that had been seeded with various facultative aerobic bacteria, and the zones of inhibition were measured. The agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Inhibition of growth was restricted to Gram-positive facultative aerobic bacteria for the individual substances zinc oxide, Portuguese rosin, or resin acids, as well as for combinations of these. In general the combination of zinc oxide and dehydroabietic acid was a more potent antibacterial substance than the corresponding combination of zinc with rosin or abietic acid. These combinations commonly had synergistic antibacterial effects.
TI  - Temafloxacin: in vitro comparison with five other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluorinated quinolone temafloxacin was compared  with the activities of ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime and tobramycin. A total of 662 recent clinical isolates were included in the study, representing a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. An agar dilution method was employed for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ciprofloxacin showed the highest potency against the Enterobacteriaceae, 90% of the isolates being inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. The other quinolones were also highly active (MIC90 = 0.25-0.5 mg/l). Ciprofloxacin and tobramycin were the most active agents against the Pseudomonas isolates (MIC90 = 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively), whereas the activities of temafloxacin, fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. All the quinolones had relatively high and similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, but S. saprophyticus was markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones. The activity of temafloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae was somewhat higher than those of the other quinolones tested. Temafloxacin showed variable activity against Bacteroides fragilis isolates but was generally more potent against these isolates than were the other quinolones. The MICs of temafloxacin were slightly lower at pH 7.3 compared with those obtained at pHs 5.8 or 8.8.
TI  - Intestinal bacteria of newborn Ethiopian infants in relation to antibiotic treatment and colonisation by potentially pathogenic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic intestinal microflora of 60 newborn infants in Addis Ababa was studied. As opposed to earlier published studies from Stockholm, there were no consistent changes of the microflora attributable to antibiotic treatment. The reason why antimicrobial agents caused quantitatively smaller changes of the intestinal microflora in newborn infants in Addis Ababa than in Stockholm is not known, but may be due to antimicrobial inactivation, or marked, continuous ingestion of bacteria. Colonisation by potentially pathogenic gram-negative bacteria was coupled to a low isolation rate of bifidobacterium, but not of lactobacillus. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bifidobacterium might convey some kind of resistance to colonisation by and overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria in newborn infants. Similar results have previously been obtained in Stockholm. In comparison to 45 healthy infants in Stockholm, the Ethiopian infants had more enterococcus and lactobacillus and less staphylococcus and bacteroides during the first 2 weeks of life. After that time, the only difference was more frequent colonisation by lactobacillus in Addis Ababa.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical PPR: isolation and identification.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic West African dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. From a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. The percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: Staphylococcus 44.0%; Streptococcus 22.67%; Neisseria 12.00%; Pasteurella 10.67%; Pseudomonas 4.00%; Proteus 4.00% and Corynebacterium 1.33%. A further break-down using biochemical tests revealed that Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67% of the total bacteria isolates; Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; Streptococcus viridans 18.67%; Streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; Neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; Proteus mirabilis 2.67%; Proteus rettgeri 1.33%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; Pasteurella multocida 4.00%; Pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and Corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.
TI  - Interspecies variations in response to topical application of selected zinc compounds.
AB  - The dermal irritancy of six zinc compounds was examined in three animal models. In open patch tests involving five daily applications, zinc chloride (1% aqueous solution) was severely irritant in rabbit, guinea-pig and mouse tests, inducing epidermal hyperplasia and ulceration; aqueous zinc acetate (20%) was slightly less irritant. Zinc oxide (20% suspension dilute Tween 80), zinc sulphate (1% aqueous solution) and zinc pyrithione (20% suspension) were not overtly irritant, but induced a marginal epidermal hyperplasia and increased hair growth. Zinc undecylenate (20% suspension) was not irritant. Epidermal irritancy in these studies is related to the interaction of zinc ion with epidermal keratin. The compounds studied were not consistently bacteriostatic in the three species tested.
TI  - Inactivation of metronidazole by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which Ent. faecalis strains and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured in the same liquid medium. All of the tested Ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates) were able to protect the B. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal MIC. Different strains of Streptococcus (14), Staphylococcus aureus (10), Staph, epidermidis (10) and Escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. When Ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different B. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by HPLC. Concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains was observed compared with Bacteroides strains cultured alone. Sonicated cell extracts of Ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of glutaraldehyde and formocresol.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic concentrations of glutaraldehyde and formocresol were determined. Minimal antimicrobial concentrations of these two agents against selected microbial flora reported in carious primary teeth were 3.125% for glutaraldehyde and 0.75% for formocresol. At a doubling of these concentrations, most organisms, except Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus mutans, were killed by both substances in 30 seconds. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on tissue cultures of pulp fibroblasts and HeLa cells at minimal cidal concentrations and at 10- and 100-fold dilutions. Exposure of pulp fibroblasts and HeLa cells to formocresol and indirect exposure to vapors caused the cells to become atrophic and to form a less dense tissue pattern. Cells directly exposed to glutaraldehyde retained their normal cell shape and tissue pattern, whereas cells indirectly exposed to vapors continued to proliferate. These data showed effective antimicrobial activity at concentrations of 3.125% glutaraldehyde and 0.75% formocresol and suggested that glutaraldehyde may exert a less cytotoxic effect on the immediate and surrounding tissues when used as a pulpotomy agent.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against United States teicoplanin clinical trial isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin was directly compared against 503 Gram-positive cocci isolated during the U.S. teicoplanin clinical trials. Both antibiotics were equally active against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, except Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Teicoplanin was fourfold more active than vancomycin against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 0.5 vs. 2.0 micrograms/ml), whereas vancomycin was more active than teicoplanin (MIC90, 2.0 vs. 8.0 micrograms/ml) against oxacillin-resistant S. haemolyticus. Teicoplanin was two- to eightfold more active than vancomycin against the streptococci and enterococci tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and cefazolin in combination with vancomycin.
AB  - 207 clinical isolates from strains of patients from the University Children's Hospital of Kiel were investigated for their in vitro activity with the agar dilution method against flomoxef and cefazolin (alone and partially in combination with vancomycin). Staphylococci were also tested with other cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefotetan and latamoxef). Flomoxef and cefazolin always acted more vigorously on staphylococci than the other cephalosporins. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains against flomoxef and cefazolin did not occur but was found in 15 and 5 of 98 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis strains were always resistant against both drugs; Streptococcus faecium strains were only moderately sensitive. Combined testing of flomoxef or cefazolin with vancomycin showed synergism in almost all staphylococcal strains. Synergism was stronger when S. epidermidis strains were only weakly sensitive to or resistant against flomoxef and cefazolin in comparison to highly sensitive strains. Flomoxef (or cefazolin) acted synergistically in combination with vancomycin on E. faecalis and S. faecium with the exception of two strains of E. faecalis which showed an additive effect of both drugs.
TI  - Clinical comparison of cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil in the treatment of patients with primary infections of the skin or skin structures.
AB  - This study was designed to compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of three oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil, in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections of the skin or skin structures. A total of 330 patients were enrolled at 10 centers and were randomly assigned to receive cefuroxime axetil 250 mg (n = 107), cephalexin 500 mg (n = 111) or cefadroxil 500 mg (n = 112), twice daily for 10 days. Patients were assessed for their clinical and bacteriological responses once during treatment (3-5 days) and twice after treatment (1-3 and 10-14 days). A total of 353 bacterial isolates were obtained: Staphylococcus aureus (41%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (33%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (5%). A satisfactory clinical outcome (cure or improvement) was achieved in 97% (89/92), 89% (80/90) and 94% (82/87) of the clinically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin or cefadroxil, respectively (p = 0.047, cefuroxime axetil vs. cephalexin). With respect to the eradication of the bacterial pathogens, a satisfactory outcome (cure or presumed cure) was obtained in 96% (69/72), 85% (60/71) and 93% (63/68) of bacteriologically evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, cephalexin and cefadroxil, respectively (p = 0.026, cefuroxime axetil vs. cephalexin). All three study drugs were well tolerated, with adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal system most commonly reported. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the incidence of drug-related adverse events.
TI  - Bacteriological study of 92 cases of proven infectious endophthalmitis treated with pars plana vitrectomy.
AB  - 92 cases of proven infectious endophthalmitis underwent pars plana vitrectomy first to identify the responsible agent and directing the antibiotherapy, second to remove the abscess and third to make room for intravitreal injection of antibiotics. A wide spectrum of organisms was isolated (16 different agents). Prognosis of endophthalmitis depends on (1) the responsible agent and (2) the reason for developing the endophthalmitis. The prognosis after lens implantation was rather favorable, whereas after vitrectomy the results were disastrous. Good results were obtained if the infecting agent was Staphylococcus epidermidis. Results after Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus or Pneumococcus were bad. Of the mycotic cases, only half of the Candida cases were cured. Other mycotic infections had a worse outcome.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of the penem ALP 201.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new penem ALP 201 was tested against 243 recent clinical isolates of which 95 were from the family Enterobacteriaceae, 50 were from the genus Streptococcus, 50 were Staphylococcus aureus and 48 were Staphylococcus epidermidis. An agar dilution technique was used to determine the MIC50 and MIC90 of ALP 201 in comparison with cefotaxime, cefuroxime, clindamycin, imipenem, piperacillin, tobramycin and vancomycin. Overnight cultures were suspended to produce inocula of 10(5) colonies from a replicator. ALP 201 was shown to have an activity similar to imipenem against most species; ALP 201 was less active than imipenem against Serratia spp. and was more active against S. epidermidis. beta-Lactamase production did not affect the activity of ALP 201. All the other compounds tested were less active than ALP 201 and imipenem.
TI  - In vitro studies on the microbicidal effectiveness of a xenon-based ultraviolet light device for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis connections.
AB  - Mercury vapor sourced ultraviolet light has been used for several years to disinfect connections that are integral to peritoneal dialysis solution delivery systems. This in vitro study evaluated the suitability of xenon flash sourced ultraviolet light as an effective alternative disinfecting agent. Candida albicans was determined to be at least four times more resistant than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ultraviolet radiation generated by both mercury vapor and xenon flash devices. Both ultraviolet devices effectively disinfected transfer set spikes that were inoculated intraluminally with each of these five test microorganisms suspended in a pool of patient dialysis effluent. However, ultraviolet (254 nm) absorbance values of dialysis effluent was found to vary greatly between patients, with the most ultraviolet-opaque effluent significantly reducing the microbicidal effectiveness of the mercury vapor, but not the xenon flash system.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal properties of propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol in vitro.
AB  - The antimicrobial properties of three glycols, - propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol - against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes A, Streptococcus mitis, and E. coli were studied in vitro. Within 20 h, 10% and 30% hexylene glycol in fresh tryptic soy broth were able to kill all the micro-organisms listed above. Five percent hexylene glycol showed some antimicrobial properties but the 1% agent had no effect. Thirty percent 1,3-butylene glycol and 30% propylene glycol were approximately as effective as 10% HG. The results speak in favour of using hexylene glycol in cosmetic and dermatological vehicles instead of propylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol.
TI  - [Study on susceptibilities of freshly isolated strains to macrolide antibiotics].
AB  - Macrolide (ML) susceptibilities of clinically isolated bacteria obtained freshly  during 1989 were determined and year to year differences in ML-resistances of the clinical isolates in our laboratory were examined with epidemiological consideration in mind. 1. The distribution of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MLs against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus showed 2 peaks, one peak representing S. aureus isolates susceptible to MLs and the other peak representing those resistant to MLs. Proportions of resistant isolates to various MLs were 36% to erythromycin, 24% each to kitasamycin, josamycin, midecamycin and midecamycin acetate. MICs of rokitamycin (RKM), however, distributed themselves into 3 peaks of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml (76%), 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml (12%) and greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml (12%). Staphylococcus spp. including Staphylococcus epidermidis showed different resistance characteristics to 14-membered ring MLs and to 16-membered ring MLs. Further, the proportion of resistant organisms to RKM was the smallest among proportions of resistant organisms to various 16-membered ring MLs tested. These differences in proportions of resistant organisms to different MLs may have resulted from differences in resistance induction activities of different MLs. The above described ratios of resistant organisms to MLs among S. aureus did not vary since 1975 among clinical isolates tested in our laboratory. 2. Four per cent (4%) of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were MLs resistant, and 18% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to MLs. Among the isolates tested in our laboratory since 1985, resistant isolates of S. pyogenes are clearly decreasing and those of S. pneumoniae seem to be increasing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer, LY264826 had lower MICs for 90% of isolates (MIC90) than vancomycin for all species tested. It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Postoperative endophthalmitis in children following cataract surgery.
AB  - Three children developed endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. Each had signs and symptoms of either nasolacrimal duct obstruction or upper respiratory infection at the time of surgery. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Final visual acuities were 6/24, LP, and NLP, respectively. Endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in infants has never been reported. These three cases drawn from two pediatric ophthalmology practices represent an incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis of 0.45%. Although this incidence report is potentially spurious, it indicates that postoperative endophthalmitis is a very real threat in infants. We recommend a thorough systems review and exam of upper airways and lacrimal system before undertaking intraocular surgery in young children. We also caution against simultaneous bilateral surgery.
TI  - In-vitro activity of vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, MDL 62873 and other agents against staphylococci, enterococci and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of different antibiotics were determined by a broth microdilution method for staphylococci, enterococci and Clostridium difficile. The antimicrobial agents tested were vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, MDL 62873, rifampicin and piperacillin, the latter limited to enterococci. In terms of MIC90S, daptomycin (0.89 mg/l). MDL 62873 (0.99 mg/l), and teicoplanin (1.50 mg/l) were found to be highly active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Daptomycin (MIC90 0.48 mg/l), MDL 62873 (0.95 mg/l) and ramoplanin (1.45 mg/l) were the most active drugs against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). Teicoplanin (MIC90 0.45 mg/l) was the most active agent against enterococci, followed by MDL 62873 (0.65 mg/l) and daptomycin (1.60 mg/l). MDL 62873 gave the lowest MIC90 (0.17 mg/l) for C. difficile. Teicoplanin (MIC90 0.42 mg/l), daptomycin (0.87 mg/l) and ramoplanin (0.98 mg/l) were also very active. Our results indicate that teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin and MDL 62873, a teicoplanin derivative, are potentially effective alternative antibiotics for treatment of infections caused by staphylococci, enterococci and C. difficile.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and infection control policies in Australia.
AB  - The pattern of neonatal bacterial infection, its management and the types of infection control policy were ascertained in 20 neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Australia by questionnaire survey. Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli were the predominant organisms responsible for perinatally acquired infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was Penicillin and Gentamicin. Staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus (majority Methicillin resistant) were the predominant organisms responsible for nosocomial infection for which the most common antibiotic combination used was Vancomycin and Cefotaxime. A Serratia epidemic was experienced in four NICU. Lumbar and suprapubic punctures were frequently done as part of the diagnostic workup in nosocomial infections but not with perinatally acquired infections. Haematological indices considered useful as a diagnosis aid varied between NICU and acute phase reactants were rarely relied upon for diagnosis or for monitoring treatment response. Granulocyte transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins were infrequently used in therapy. No consensus was found on infection control policies. Eight NICU required routine gowning on entry, two restricted sibling visiting and four restricted visiting by relatives and friends. Although routine bacteriological surveillance on staff or equipment was uncommon, serial cultures were carried out in infants from the body surface in six NICU and from the endotracheal aspirate in 17 NICU. Antiseptics used with technical procedures included iodine, chlorhexidine and alcohol used singly or in combination. Skin and umbilical cord care also varied between NICU. The literature was reviewed to determine the effectiveness or otherwise of some of the existing policies in the prevention or management of neonatal infection to encourage consensus towards a more rational approach to neonatal infection in Australia.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - Role of Bacteroides uniformis in susceptibility of Ta:CF# 1 mice to infection by  Treponema hyodysenteriae.
AB  - Among the various strains and colonies of mice tested specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Ta:CF#1 mice exhibited the highest susceptibility to Treponema hyodysenteriae infection. Staphylococcus epidermidis 1047, Streptococcus faecalis 2039, Lactobacillus murinus 3010, Escherichia coli 1049, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 3008 were administered to the Ta:CF#1 mice. B. uniformis IK, which appeared to colonize in the breeding facility under SPF conditions, was isolated from the cecal content of a Ta:CF#1 mouse and identified in the mouse flora. Germfree mice were infected with these six bacteria and challenged with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 to elucidate the causal relationship between these bacteria and the sensitivity of mice to T. hyodysenteriae infection. No cecal lesions were observed in gnotobiotic mice either monoassociated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 or B. uniformis IK or inoculated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 combined with the 5 a.m. strains. Gross cecal lesions appeared only in mice inoculated with T. hyodysenteriae DJ70P3 combined with B. uniformis IK. A new SPF mouse colony (CF#1/b Ta) established from gnotobiotic mice by inoculation with B. uniformis IK and the 5 laboratory stock cultures was as susceptible to T. hyodysenteriae as the original Ta:CF#1 mice. This suggests that B. uniformis IK plays an important role in the high susceptibility of Ta:CF#1 mice to T.hyodysenteriae.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pWBG637 from Staphylococcus aureus to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmids pWBG636 (GmR) and pWBG642 (EmR) derived from the conjugative plasmid pWBG637 were tested for ability to transfer conjugatively to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Both plasmids transferred to S. epidermidis and Strept. faecalis but not to B. subtilis and E. coli. Once in S. epidermis and Strept. faecalis they were transferred back to S. aureus. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the plasmids were stably maintained in S epidermidis and Strept. faecalis.
TI  - Management of empyema thoracis.
AB  - Over a 5-year period, 65 adult patients with empyema thoracis were treated. The cause of the empyema was postpneumonic in 52%, postresectional in 24%, a complication of minor surgical procedures in 14%, posttraumatic in 5%, and the result of miscellaneous causes in 5%. In the postpneumonic group, infection resulted from a single aerobic organism in 41%, multiple aerobic organisms in 9%, single anaerobic organisms in 12%, and mixed aerobic-anaerobic organisms in 18%. Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were the most common organisms, accounting for 55% of bacterial isolates. All 34 patients with postpneumonic empyema were initially treated with drainage, which was successful in two thirds. The remainder, 12 patients, ultimately required thoracotomy. Decortication was combined with intrathoracic transposition of extrathoracic skeletal muscles in 9 patients. There was no reoperation or recurrence of infection, and thoracoplasty was avoided; residual spaces were filled by the transposed muscle.
TI  - Antistaphylococcal activity of pentamidine.
AB  - Pentamidine isethionate was bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Candida albicans. S. aureus was inhibited by concentrations of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml and killed by 64 to greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcal killing was consistently greater in the presence of cations and was unaffected by methicillin resistance.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro activity of new cephalosporin derivatives containing a benzoxazolone ring.
AB  - New cephalosporin derivatives containing a benzoxazolone ring in the side acylamino chain are synthesized using chlorides of non-substituted and halogen substituted (2-benzoxazolone-3-yl) acetic acids for the acylation of the 7-aminodesacetoxy-cephalosporanic acid and 7-amino-cephalosporanic acid amino group. Some of these new compounds exhibit a biological activity higher than that of cephalexin and cephazolin against clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus group A and B.
TI  - Cervical osteomyelitis due to i.v. heroin use: radiologic findings in 14 patients.
AB  - We reviewed the radiographs of 14 patients who had cervical osteomyelitis and were IV heroin users. Eleven were men and three were women. Their age range was 33-48 years (mean, 39 years). Eleven regularly used the jugular vein access, and three alternated between the jugular and femoral veins. Initial radiographs of the cervical spine in 13 patients showed destruction of two or more vertebral bodies and the adjacent intervertebral disk, as well as a prevertebral soft-tissue mass. In one patient, findings on initial radiographs were normal, but marked destruction at two contiguous intervertebral levels and a large prevertebral abscess were identified 2 weeks later. All the patients had positive results on cultures of joint aspirates or bone biopsy materials (10 patients) or blood (four patients). Ten grew Staphylococcus aureus; two, Staphylococcus epidermidis; one, Streptococcus viridans; and one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CT in nine patients showed inflammatory reaction adjacent to the carotid sheath resulting from the repeated jugular injections and delineated the extent of prevertebral abscess and bone destruction. Scintigrams were of minimal value in establishing the diagnosis. Advanced vertebral body destruction, disk space infection, prevertebral abscess, and anterior cervical inflammatory reaction appear to be typical findings on radiographs in heroin abusers with cervical osteomyelitis.
TI  - The risk of intentional dissolution of the smear layer after mechanical preparation of root canals.
AB  - The root canals of 27 caries-free human cuspids were divided into 3 groups of 9 teeth each. Group I was mechanically prepared with reamers and files. Alternate irrigation with 5.25% NaOCl and 3% hydrogen peroxide was used between each instrument. The group II root canals were prepared with the use of alternate irrigation with the same concentrations of NaOCl and hydrogen peroxide and finally flushed with 17% EDTA and NaOCl solution. Group III was prepared mechanically with the use of sterile distilled water as an irrigant followed by a final flush with 17% EDTA solution. The root canals of all specimens were obturated with gutta-percha points and Tubliseal by means of the lateral condensation technique. After the root canals were obturated, samples of each of the three groups were immersed in separate flasks containing Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium hofmannii. All the microorganisms tested invaded the coronal dentin--where the access cavity had been sealed with Fynal--and/or the main foramen.
TI  - [The use of teicoplanin in neutropenic patients: values and limits].
AB  - The efficacy and the safety of teicoplanin were evaluated for the treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. A total of 18 patients received teicoplanin once daily as an intravenous injection of 200 mg in 6 patients (after a loading dose of 400 mg) or 400 mg in 12 patients (loading dose: 800 mg). The mean duration of therapy was 15.9 days (range 9 to 39 days). In all patients teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic usually a beta-lactam. Thirteen of 18 patients were successfully treated. Three febrile episodes proved to be microbiologically documented infections and were cured by teicoplanin: one Streptococcus mitis and two methicillin-resistant (methi-R) Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremias. Neither toxicity nor side effects were observed in the reported group. Six patients experiencing reactions to vancomycin (2 cases of cutaneous allergy) or to vancomycin and amphotericin B combination (4 cases of nephrotoxicity) were subsequently treated with teicoplanin without any evidence of cross-sensitivity. We observed emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 3 patients receiving teicoplanin: 20, 18 and 8 days after a first febrile episode cured by teicoplanin and a beta-lactam, they developed fever while receiving the same antibiotic regimen. Methi-R Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood cultures in the first patient and methi-R Staphylococcus haemolyticus in the two other patients. In one patient, successfully treated by teicoplanin for a first febrile episode related to a methi-R Staphylococcus epidermidis, emergence of Staphylococcus haemolyticus occurred 8 days later while the patient was on teicoplanin therapy (6 mg/kg). MICs of teicoplanin were 16 mg/l for the two Staphylococcus strains isolated in this patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effects of room-temperature exposure on bacterial growth in stored red cells.
AB  - Experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (RT) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of AS-1 packed red cell (RBC) units contained in PL146 plastic bags. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed RBC units. The units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees C for 14 days. On two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees C for 2 hours. Timed samples taken during the periods at RT revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units, and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. Samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. These results indicate that RT exposure of contaminated RBC units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis: clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic aspects.
AB  - The charts of 73 children (31 girls, 42 boys) aged 4 months to 14 years (mean 4.5 years) with acute mastoiditis managed during a 16-year period were reviewed. Of the patients 36% were less than 24 months old. Retro-auricular swelling was described in 63 of the 73 children, tenderness in 59, erythema in 58, and protrusion of the auricle in 45. A pathological tympanic membrane was noted in 33% of the patients and fever in only 29%. Apart from local inflammation, the most frequent complaints and symptoms were otalgia (n = 42), recent upper respiratory tract infections (n = 22), and fever alone (n = 22). A subperiosteal abscess was found in 36 patients, and CNS involvement in 5. Nearly half of the patients (48%) were on antibiotic therapy at admission. The isolation rates in bacterial cultures from subperiosteal aspirated (81%) and from mastoid mucosa (68%) were considerably higher than from blood cultures (14%) and were not influenced by previously administered antibiotics. Pneumococci (9/32) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (6/32) were the agents most often isolated. The incidence of the bacteria isolated from patients pre-treated with antibiotics differed from the incidence in patients not previously treated. In 24 patients (33%) the lesion healed with antibiotic therapy without mastoid surgery. Myringotomy and the insertion of a ventilation tube is indicated initially, if acute otitis media with effusion is found. In the absence of a subperiosteal abscess and of CNS involvement, a 48-hour trial of intravenous antibiotic therapy, directed also against staphylococci, is justified before mastoid surgery is considered.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in the urethra of men with Chlamydia trachomatis urethritis before and after treatment with ofloxacin].
AB  - From urethra of 40 men with CTU, 190 bacterial strains were isolated, 110 before  and 80 after treatment with OFX (400 mg daily for 5 days). Among the strains coexisting with Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus epidermidis (30.9%), Micrococcus (13.6%), Streptococcus group D (10.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%) were isolated more frequently than others. The in vitro susceptibility testing showed that, in comparison to erythromycin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline and co-trimoxazole, OFX was the most active antimicrobial agent against the majority of bacteria (except streptococci) isolated from urethra in CTU cases in men. The OFX treatment was found to reduce the total number of isolated strains, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, without disturbing normal urethral flora.
TI  - The clinical development of mupirocin.
AB  - Mupirocin is a novel antibiotic totally unrelated in chemical structure and mode  of action to any other clinically useful class of antibiotics. It has greatest antibacterial activity against aerobic gram-positive cocci, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other beta-hemolytic streptococci. Bactroban ointment is formulated as 2% mupirocin in polyethylene glycol ointment. No systemic absorption of mupirocin or its major metabolite, monic acid, has been detected in short courses of topical administration to healthy volunteers or to patients with epidermolysis bullosa after prolonged courses of therapy with Bactroban ointment. Randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials have shown that mupirocin is safe and effective for the treatment of impetigo.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - We treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. Four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. All recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. At the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. The bacterial species isolated were S. epidermidis, group D streptococcus, P. acnes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. All patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. Factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. A single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. Patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.
TI  - Abnormal maxillary sinus radiographs in children: do they represent bacterial infection?
AB  - Thirty-three children with chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoid enlargement and without previous diagnosis of sinusitis were studied regarding the bacterial flora of their maxillary sinuses. Puncture of maxillary sinus was performed at surgery (adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy) and aspirates were cultured. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 8 of 12 (66.7%) patients whose x-rays showed completely opacified maxillary sinus. Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from 6 (28.6%) of the 21 patients with normal maxillary sinus radiographs. Bacterial titers were greater than 10(4) colonies/mL in all but one of the positive cultures. No anaerobic bacteria were isolated. History of bronchial asthma, presence of nasal purulent secretion, elevated blood eosinophils, and elevated serum IgE were found more frequently in children with complete opacification of maxillary sinus. Serum levels of IgG2 were low in 29% of the children, but no correlation was found between low IgG2 levels and positive cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. We concluded that children with complete radiologic opacification of maxillary sinus had bacterial infection in almost 70% of the cases with symptoms that did not prompt their physicians to consider the diagnosis of sinusitis.
TI  - [Enzymatic lysis of staphylococci in relation to their species and strain properties].
AB  - The lysoenzyme preparation from Streptomyces recifensis subsp. lyticus 2435 had a marked lytic activity against staphylococci of different species, spectra and antibiotic sensitivity. Certain strain differences of the cells in the population could be easily eliminated with increasing the dose. The preparation is a complex of lytic enzymes with high antimicrobial activity. It was concluded that it could be considered as a potentially promising chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
TI  - [Bacterial endocarditis in pregnancy. Description of 2 cases and review of the literature].
AB  - Bacterial endocarditis in pregnancy is uncommon. We described two cases: the first case of endocarditis, caused by staphylococcus epidermidis (at the 35th week of pregnancy) was complicated by severe aortic valvular insufficiency; the second case, endocarditis caused by streptococcus alpha hemolytic (at the 32nd week of pregnancy) was complicated by severe mitral valvular insufficiency associated with multiple systemic emboli. Therapy consisted, in the first case of partum-induction followed by antibiotic therapy; in the second case it consisted of specific antibiotic therapy followed by gestation. There was no maternal or fetal mortality in the two cases.
TI  - Treatment of bone and soft tissue infections with teicoplanin.
AB  - The use of teicoplanin was evaluated in a group of 33 patients, which included 18 prosthetic infections, seven with osteomyelitis, five skin and soft tissue infections, and three cases of septic arthritis. The bacterial pathogens isolated were 27 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive 18; methicillin resistant 9), Staph. hominis (2), Staph. epidermidis (1), Staph. haemolyticus (2), Enterococcus faecalis (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Peptococcus spp. (1). Eleven patients had polymicrobial infections (Gram-positive plus Gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria). In ten cases (nine polymicrobial infections) teicoplanin was used in combination with other antibiotics. Teicoplanin was administered intravenously 400 mg every 24 h in 26 cases, 200 mg every 24 h in six cases and 600 mg every 24 h in one case. The duration of the treatment ranged from 9 to 73 days with a mean of 27.3. Efficacy was evaluable in 30 patients, because in three patients treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions. Cure or improvement was noted in 28 patients (93%). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (83.3%).
TI  - Complement C3 deposition onto bacteria by neonatal serum is not enhanced after the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin.
AB  - To determine the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on the capacity of serum from septic neonates to deposit complement C3 and IgG onto the bacteria isolated from their blood, 500 mg/kg of IVIG was administered to 18 neonates suspected of being septic. Blood was obtained just before the infusion, and again 15 minutes after its completion. Group B streptococcus type II, group B streptococcus type III, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from the pre-infusion blood of four neonates. Bacteria were incubated with the appropriate serum, washed, and the amount of C3 and IgG subsequently bound to the organisms was quantified by radioimmunobinding assay. Sera from the four septic neonates and sera from four neonates of similar gestational age but whose blood cultures were negative were compared with pooled sera from healthy adults. Before the administration of IVIG, C3 deposition onto the bacteria by sera from five of the seven neonates tested was significantly less than that observed for adult sera. Following the infusion, no increase in C3 deposition was observed for any of the seven sera assayed, and in two cases C3 deposition fell significantly. In contrast, in seven of eight cases, IVIG enhanced the IgG deposition to levels greater than or equal to those observed for adult sera. Therefore, following the infusion of IVIG into neonates with proven or suspected sepsis, the deposition of C3 onto invasive bacteria by their serum was not enhanced even though IgG deposition was increased.
TI  - The phototoxic inhibitory effect and phototoxic killing effect of micro-organisms.
AB  - The toxic and phototoxic growth inhibitory and killing effect of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenus gr. A, St. viridans, Pityrosporum ovale and Candida albicans were studied. P. ovale and St. viridans were the only micro-organisms with any toxic effect against the other micro-organisms tested. P. ovale inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli. St. viridans inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli, St. pyogenus gr. A and P. ovale. This effect was only growth inhibitory and not direct killing. The activity was increased by UVA on S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Ps. aeruginosa but not on E. coli and St. pyogenes gr. A. These effects of P. ovale and St. viridans may be of importance in the defense against infections.
TI  - Clinical management of orbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out by the Department of Ophthalmology and the Division of Infectious Disease at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario to assess the outcome of our medical management of orbital cellulitis in children using a predetermined antibiotic regimen and to determine whether computed tomographic (CT) evidence of a subperiosteal abscess alone was an indication for surgical drainage. Between February 1985 and January 1988, 23 patients with true orbital cellulitis were admitted. CT scans were ordered routinely at the time of admission. The scans were cancelled for 13 children because they responded rapidly to medical management. CT showed edema nasal to the medial rectus, or thickening or displacement of the muscle in 8 of the 10 children who underwent the procedure. Three children required sinus and orbital drainage, but frank purulent material was found subperiosteally in only one. The results suggest that most children with orbital cellulitis can be managed with the prompt use of the appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Therapy with cloxacillin sodium and chloramphenicol or, in children under age 6 years, cefuroxime best covers the spectrum of organisms responsible for most cases of orbital cellulitis in children. CT should be used as an ancillary guide to the need for surgical exploration of the orbit in patients who do not rapidly respond to medical management.
TI  - Adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro mediated by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - The adherence of two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis to human fibrin-platelet clots in vitro was investigated. Both strains were noncapsulated, nonhemagglutinating, and nonslime producers. Binding was not related to surface charge, carbohydrate profile, or hydrophobicity of the bacteria. Adherence was reduced four- to sixfold (P less than 0.001) on pretreatment of bacteria with lipase, while neuraminidase, trypsin, phospholipase C, and sodium periodate did not alter their binding. Pretreatment of bacteria with substances known to bind lipoteichoic acid (LTA), such as human albumin and anti-LTA antibodies, also resulted in a fourfold (P less than 0.001) reduction in adherence. Prior incubation of clots with free LTA, but not with deacylated LTA, produced a fourfold (P less than 0.001) decrease in the adherence of homologous and heterologous strains of S. epidermidis. A similar reduction was also observed when LTAs derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were used. These data provide evidence that the lipid moiety of LTA has a central role in the adherence of S. epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
TI  - Contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  - As a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. Herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. It appears that the contact Nd:YAG laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.
TI  - [Cefpiramide: antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, and clinical evaluation].
AB  - We determined MIC values of cefpiramide (CPM) against clinical isolates from 100  patients who were subjected to total hysterectomy between April 1986 and March 1988. We also investigated the concentrations of CPM in uterine tissue and assessed the clinical efficacy of postoperative prophylaxis. 1. Against bacteria isolated from clinical materials the MIC80 values of CPM were as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis 1.56 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecalis 25 micrograms/ml, and Escherichia coli 6.25 micrograms/ml. 2. Peak concentrations of CPM in various tissues and tissue/serum ratios of AUC were as follows: cervix uteri 35 micrograms/g (39.5%), perimetrium 43 micrograms/g (44.9%), endometrium 39 micrograms/g (51.6%), myometrium 28 micrograms/g (26.8%), oviduct 67 micrograms/g (41.9%), and ovary 27 micrograms/g (45.8%). In all tissues examined CPM concentrations were above 4 micrograms/g after 600 minutes. 3. Serum half-lives were T 1/2(alpha) = 13.2 minutes and T 1/2(beta) = 260.2 minutes. 4. The efficacy rate in postoperative prophylaxis was 97.9%. 5. No serious side effects were observed.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - Ceftriaxone monotherapy for bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  - A total of 33 patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with single daily doses of ceftriaxone (CTR 100 mg/kg/day i.v.) for a median duration of 13 days. Pathogens isolated by culture and/or determined by latex agglutination were 15 Haemophilus influenzae b, 7 Neisseria meningitidis, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 group B streptococcus, 2 Streptococcus viridans and 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis. In 4 cases a diagnosis of purulent meningitis could only be made by means of the inflammatory liquor parameters. All cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug levels even at the end of the dosing interval were at least 10-fold higher than the MICs of the respective bacterial isolates. The average penetration of CTR into the CSF was 6.6%. Within 12-46 h after the first dose, control spinal taps were performed. Cultures were sterile in all cases. Side effects encountered were diarrhea, exanthema, neutropenia and transient elevation of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, but none caused a change of therapy. One patient developed a biliary concrement. No patient died; 5 patients had prolonged fever (greater than 5 days), and 2 were left with persistent hearing deficiencies. CTR can be recommended as a safe and effective antibiotic agent for once daily treatment of bacterial meningitis in children.
TI  - [Evaluation of conjunctival cultures in various eye infections].
AB  - 1550 conjunctival cultures taken between 1985-1988 were evaluated retrospectively. Among 455 cultures with positive growth, bacterial agents seen in their order of occurrence were Staphylococcus epidermidis (35.82%), Streptococcus pneumonia (19.34%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18.46%), respectively. Moreover, the distribution of agents in 185 cases with complete clinical records were discussed in the light of data found in the literature.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of zinc oxide in vitro.
AB  - Antibacterial activity, zinc concentrations and pH were measured in Muller-Hinton broth containing different amounts of zinc oxide and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (10(6) colony forming units/ml). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of zinc oxide to different clinical isolates were determined using the Muller-Hinton agar dilution tests. Gram-positive bacteria were most susceptible. Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and streptococci were usually not inhibited even at the highest concentrations used (1024 micrograms/ml), but staphylococci--particularly some isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis--were sensitive enough to allow determination of their MIC.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [A clinical study of asymptomatic bacteriospermia].
AB  - Asymptomatic bacteriospermia was studied as an entity and its treatment was investigated in 65 subjects who clinically needed their semen tested. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. The rate of detection of bacteria in semen was 89.2%, and the rates of detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were 55.4% and 70.8%, respectively. Forty Gram-positive strains were identified among the aerobic bacteria; rates of detection for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were high, and 6 strains (9.2%) of Streptococcus agalactiae were also present. The rate of detection of Gram-negative bacteria was low; only 3 strains were identified. Among the anaerobic bacteria 90 Gram-positive strains were identified; the rate of detection of Peptostreptococcus (58 strains) was high, and only 11 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were present. 2. Among cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin, lomefloxacin, latamoxef and flomoxef (FMOX), FMOX was, in general, superior to the other drugs in terms of antibacterial activities against those strains isolated from semen. 3. Bacterial changes were observed in the semen specimens from 11 subjects who were subjected to oral administration of CCL (1,500 mg/days). After the treatment, 25 strains of bacteria disappeared but 7 strains remained among 32 strains that were present before treatment, and 23 strains appeared due to superinfection.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of natural products: 1. Propolis.
AB  - Material extracted from propolis (bee glue) by alkaline aqueous solvents or organic solvents showed weak inhibitory activity in vitro against certain species of Gram-positive bacteria. No antimicrobial activity was detected in urine from three volunteers who had taken 500 mg propolis three times a day for 3 days.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime, alone or in combination, against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes was investigated. Synergy studies were performed using time-kill curves and the chequerboard test. The time-kill curves were performed on five strains each of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Strep. pyogenes; cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime were tested alone or in combination at MIC and sub-MIC values. The chequerboard test was performed in microtitre plates on ten strains each of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Strep. pyogenes: the results were interpreted by the fractional inhibitory concentration index. In some cases both methods showed synergistic interaction against the staphylococci tested. Indifference was observed against Strep. pyogenes.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - Flow cytometric identification of microorganisms by dual staining with FITC and PI.
AB  - The identification of microorganisms by flow cytometry was evaluated by using a double staining technique with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate and a two dimensional analysis. A diverse group of 19 different species and strains of microorganisms was tested to determine if they could be differentiated by flow cytometry. The organisms tested displayed characteristic and distinct two dimensional fluorescent patterns which allowed ready grouping and differentiation into subsets of organisms. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the histograms and the ratio of red to green signals expressed these differences quantitatively and allowed organisms to be placed into one of three groups based on these values. In some instances, as with Streptococcus pneumoniae and pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, it was possible to distinguish between species of bacteria from the same genus. The use of dual dye labeling and flow cytometry provided a rapid method of identifying selected microorganisms and may be broadly applicable for the detection and identification of many bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Electrophoretic analysis of ureases in Streptococcus salivarius and in saliva.
AB  - Experimental conditions were established for the extraction, electrophoresis and  detection of urease isoenzymes from Streptococcus salivarius. Thiol concentrations were critical and ureases from different strains varied in ease of dissociation. A characteristic pattern was obtained for 30 ureolytic S. salivarius strains isolated from; saliva (6), dental plaque (12), artificial dental plaque (6) and non-oral sources (6), and also for a ureolytic Streptococcus bovis from artificial plaque. One non-oral S. salivarius strain had ureases with slightly slower mobility. The electrophoretic pattern and mobility of ureases extracted from human mixed salivary bacteria were identical to those from S. salivarius except for an additional set of urease bands from unknown species of bacteria. There were no ureases from saliva matching those from Staphylococcus epidermidis--a contributor to ureolysis in artificial plaque. We conclude that there is considerable biochemical homogeneity among S. salivarius ureases and possibly other ureolytic streptococci. In saliva, urea is metabolized mainly by streptococcal ureases.
TI  - [Impact of infections on mortality in children with cancer].
AB  - A study of the role infections play in the death of 29 children with cancer was conducted from 1983 to 1988. An infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of their death. The most frequently found etiological agents found in hemocultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp and Candida spp. A retrospective study on the role of infections in the death of children with cancer was conducted. The clinical and autopsy records of 29 children who died between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. Infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of death. The most frequent etiologic agents found in blood cultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [Endocarditis with Ionescu-Shiley's bioprosthesis. Long-term results].
AB  - With the aim to attesting the ability of treated pericardial tissue to resist infection we analyzed the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis in 541 operative survivors with the Ionescu-Shiley (I-S) valve since January 1977. A total of 580 valves were available for the study, 21 (3.8%) sustained I-S endocarditis or 0.65% patients/annum. The mean age was 53.2 years; male/female ratio was 16/5. Native endocarditis was present in 20 cases (3.6%). There were 13 aortic endocarditis (2 in cases of multiple replacement) and eight mitral. The interval between insertion and endocarditis ranged from 2 weeks to 108 months (means 31); 8 cases were early I-S endocarditis (38%) and 13 late endocarditis (62%). The organisms isolated were: Staphylococcus (epidermidis, aureus) in 10 cases. Streptococcus (viridans, fecalis) in 7 cases, gram negative in three and no organism was cultured in 3 cases. The outcome was as follows: specific medical treatment in 4 cases (one early), valve re-replacement in 11 (four early) from whom eight survived, and 6 patients died with unspecific medical treatment. The total mortality rate 9/21 (43%), in early endocarditis 5/8 (62.5%) and in late endocarditis 5/13 (38%). Operative and necropsy findings in 12/21 showed always periprosthetic abscess but no leaflet perforations. The rate of I-S valve endocarditis compares favourably with other valve substitutes. Early re-replacement combined with adequate antibiotic treatment is mandatory according to our experience.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - We compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.
TI  - Immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. Swedish Study Group.
AB  - In the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. Sixty-six patients (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. Five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d. for 5-29 days (median nine days). Three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days after the first dose. One third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately severe in 33 of the patients. Fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. The immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Among the aerobic microorganisms isolated Escherichia coli (46 strains) Staphylococcus epidermidis (22 strains), Streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). Thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. E. coli and B. fragilis gave rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against S. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against S. milleri in two cases and against E. faecalis in three cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a new tetracyclic quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of KB-5246, a tetracyclic quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum. The in vitro activity of KB-5246 against gram-negative bacteria was higher than that of ofloxacin or norfloxacin and was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. KB-5246 demonstrated the greatest activity against gram-positive bacteria of the four agents tested. Among Streptococcus pyogenes strains resistant to 1.56 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 26 strains susceptible to 0.2 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Similarly, among the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains resistant to 3.13 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 23 S. aureus and 11 S. epidermidis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. Among the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis strains resistant to 12.5 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, there were 5 S. pneumoniae and 10 E. faecalis strains susceptible to 0.39 micrograms of KB-5246 per ml. KB-5246 had bactericidal activity at the MIC. KB-5246 demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against various systemic infections in mice. After oral administration, KB-5246 was as active as ofloxacin and about two times more active than norfloxacin.
TI  - New receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  - 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of S. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of S. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group G streptococci and 14/14 strains of S. pneumoniae. Eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. S. equisimilis demonstrated the highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). On the other hand, all strains of S. agalactiae, the majority of S. faecalis and all S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. The concentration of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mM. These estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. Binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. Binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the B-chain region. As streptokinase interacts mainly with the B-chain of plasmin it is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.
TI  - Deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli; ingestion of S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis was moderate. Peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. To find out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized S. aureus. Upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (SAM), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with SAM. The results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by these macrophages. The release of hydrogen peroxide by SAM-pretreated peritoneal macrophages upon stimulation with PMA or opsonized S. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The comparative in vitro activity of ofloxacin and selected ophthalmic antimicrobial agents against ocular bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone anti-infective agent, was evaluated against 419 ocular bacterial isolates of 55 species to determine its potential as a topical agent for the treatment of ocular infections. Other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin B. Ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (MIC90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. The MIC90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and St. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against P. aeruginosa. Because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - [A clinical and experimental study of longatsef].
AB  - Data are reported of the results of clinical trials of the therapeutic efficacy of longaceph--a drug of the new generation of cephalosporins with a long period of half-decay--in acute pneumonia complicating influenza in 42 patients. The sensitivity of 120 microbial strains to longaceph was also studied. It was established that cephalosporin possesses a high efficacy in diseases caused by gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. A high degree of sensitivity to longaceph was observed in pneumococci biogenous and Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, klebsiellae and escherichiae. A new property of longaceph was found, namely, its capacity to stimulate the formation of endogenous interferon.
TI  - Daptomycin (LY146032) for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of daptomycin (LY146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. A single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of S. aureus and S. sanguis. Daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of S. epidermidis. A single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. For treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. Daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single daily dose of 600,000 U of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of S. sanguis.
TI  - In vitro adherence of bacteria to sutures in cardiac surgery.
AB  - The adherence of bacteria to sutures used in cardiac surgery was studied by in vitro quantitative determination with [3H]-leucine-labeled Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguis. The adherence per unit area for staphylococci was least for monofilament polypropylene (Prolene), 3 times higher (p less than 0.05) for braided polyester (Mersiline) and greatest (10 times, p less than 0.005) for braided polyester sutures coated with polybutylate (Ethibond). Mean values for the adherence of streptococci were low for all the sutures. Sutures pretreated with human plasma showed a 12-37% increase in bacterial adherence. The cell surface hydrophobicity, surface charge and the haemagglutinating property of bacteria did not correlate with their adherence property. In view of these observations, it is suggested that: (a) the preferential adherence of staphylococci to intra-cardiac sutures may be one of the explanations for its being the commonest cause of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, (b) there is a need for a careful selection of sutures used in cardiac surgery and (c) the described in vitro assay for bacterial adherence may be used for monitoring the development of better designed sutures and the effect of incorporation of antibiotics in the sutures.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - [Conduction disorders in aortic periprosthetic abscesses].
AB  - Active infective endocarditis (AIE) involving native and especially prosthetic aortic valve is often complicated by conduction abnormalities. These conduction disturbances are considered to represent extension of infection from the valve to the annulus and surrounding myocardium. The authors report their experience of conduction disorders in 6/8 patients in whom the aortic prosthetic valve infection was complicated by periprosthetic abscess. They underline the importance of conduction abnormalities as early markers of severe complication in patients with AIE. In fact, their detection is a useful tool in revealing severe complications since clinical, laboratory and other noninvasive examinations do not always allow early diagnosis of the extension of infection to the surrounding myocardium.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - [Quality control of erythrocyte concentrates in 6 transfusion centers in Croatia].
AB  - Quality control of red cell concentrates (RCC) was performed in six Blood Transfusion Centres in Croatia. Between 1.5 and 3.7% of the produced or/and used RCC were examined. Large differences in volume and haematocrit were found between red cell concentrates. 63.2% of concentrates had a volume larger than 225 ml. The mean haematocrit was 65.5%, and a haematocrit above 65% was observed in 51.6% of RCC. From 3.5% of RCC bacteria were isolated (gram positive coccus, Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus). The quality of RCC was not found to be satisfactory. In order to improve their quality procedures for their production, standards and legal requirements have to be established.
TI  - [Experimental and clinical studies on cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - 1. Absorption and elimination Serum and urinary levels of cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221) were determined in 7 children with ages ranging from 3 to 12 years after a intravenous bolus injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. The average serum level of the drug was 119.27 +/- 13.83 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, then decreased gradually with a half-life of 2.01 +/- 0.25 hours to 10.56 +/- 2.93 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The average urinary elimination rate was 77.34 +/- 12.60%. 2. Clinical study CDZM was given to the following 39 patients with ages ranging from 2 months to 15 years and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. The treated cases were 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 30 cases of acute pneumonia, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media and 2 cases of acute urinary tract infections. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 29 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.1%. Organisms presumed to be pathogens included 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9 Haemophilus influenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain and 8 non-producing strains) and 1 Enterococcus faecalis. The last one was decreased and the others were eradicated with an eradication rate of 93.3% for all strains. Adverse reactions occurred in no patients. Abnormal changes in laboratory test values involved only 1 case each of elevated GOT, elevated GOT and GPT, eosinophilia and thrombocytosis. Based on the above-mentioned result and features of this drug, it was confirmed that this drug showed an excellent usefulness in the treatment of infections in childhood. It may be also effective in the management of infections under immunosuppression.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine isolated from Prosopis juliflora.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from Prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two Candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. Significant inhibitory effect was noted against Gram positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. citreus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against S. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. lactis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, C. hofmannii and Bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. Its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. The inhibitory effect of julifloricine on Gram negative bacteria such as the species of Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Aeromonas and Vibrio was almost insignificant. Julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against C. tropicalis and responded equally to C. albicans. As compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which included Herpes simplex 1 and Newcastle disease virus. Julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.
TI  - [Treatment of peritonitis under continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis using intraperitoneal ceftazidime].
AB  - Management of peritonitis related to chronic ambulatory peritoneal ceftazidime. In 15 patients under CAPD, 22 cases of bacterial peritonitis were observed with clinical manifestation in 14. The mean cell count in peritoneal dialysis fluid was 3 580/mm3 with 3 040/mm3 polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Causative pathogens were: Staphylococcus in 11 cases, Streptococcus in 3, Sarcines in 2, Corynebacterium in 2, Micrococcus varians in 1, Gram negative in 3. First choice treatment was a intraperitoneal injection of 1 g of ceftazidime every 48 hours, 54.5% of patients recovered within 5 days. Failures were due to 4 Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Sarcine, 1 Streptococcus liquefaciens, 1 Corynebacterium hofmanii. Mean ceftazidime concentrations 48 hours after the intraperitoneal injection were 35 mg/l (range = 14-54 mg/l) in serum and 5.5 mg/l (E: 2.8,8 mg/l) in dialysate. These concentrations in dialysate, are not greater than most of ceftazidime'S CMI for susceptible bacteria. A single daily intraperitoneal injection of ceftazidime is desirable.
TI  - Cost of mastitis and its prevention in four dairy cattle herds on St Croix, US Virgin Islands.
AB  - Nonclinical mastitis in the dairy herds on St Croix, US Virgin Islands, represents a prevalent (97%) and severe problem (44% of quarters had California Mastitis Test results of 2 or 3). Streptococcus agalactiae (26%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%) were the most prevalent pathogens. More than half (54%) of all organisms isolated and tested for resistance were resistant to ampicillin and benzyl penicillin; 29% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfadiazine. Estimates of the loss of milk production suggested that there was a loss of 4.40 to 13.33 lb/cow/day. The yearly economic cost of prevention was estimated for each cow ($22.07); yearly income loss attributable to mastitis was estimated to be from $339 to $1,022/cow/yr. Suggestions for the prevention and control of mastitis are included.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of lomefloxacin activity in Colombia.
AB  - As part of the worldwide in vitro program to determine the antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, our study tested susceptibility of bacterial isolates from hospitals in Medellin, Colombia. A total of 504 bacterial isolates were obtained from patients at three different centers. For Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 micrograms/ml inhibited 100% of the indole-positive Proteus and Salmonella spp.; 1 microgram/ml inhibited 100% of Shigella and Citrobacter, 2 microgram/ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacter spp., E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates tested. The MIC90 for Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. was 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and 2 micrograms/ml for S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus. The MIC90 of Streptococcus spp. were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for all isolates tested. Considering that 97.8% were susceptible to concentrations of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of lomefloxacin, this new quinolone offers potential in the therapy of a variety of systemic infections, especially in patients with multiply resistant pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, QA-241.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, QA-241, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) -1,7-dioxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ii]quinolizine-2-carboxylic hydrochloride, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. QA-241 inhibited 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. It was two-fold and four- to 16-fold less active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. QA-241 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species than ciprofloxacin. Most Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 1 microgram/ml, as was that for S. epidermidis. For streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. QA-241 had minimal activity against anaerobic species. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-9) for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistant strains could be isolated by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity was less at an acid pH and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations. QA-241 showed a good postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of chronic paranasal sinusitis].
AB  - Analysis was done on the bacteria flora and the antibiotic sensitivity of 533 maxillary sinuses in 430 patients with chronic sinusitis treated at the Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital during the past 10 years. Among antral flora, Streptococcus sp. were the most common (212 strains, 38.4%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (140 strains, 25.4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (33 strains, 5.9%). These three G(+) bacteria made up 70% (69.87%) of the total. The percentage of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria was 20.8% and 8.7%, respectively. Of the total bacteria cultures, 17.8% showed no-growth. These results were similar to those reported in a similar study 10 years before. For the Streptococci and Staphylococci (70% of the total number), the most susceptible antibiotics in vitro were cephalosporin, followed in order by clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole. The effectiveness of ampicillin, gentamicin, minocycline appears to have been decreasing in the past 10 years. Tetracycline and penicillin effectiveness was worse. The susceptibility spectrum of the G(-) bacteria did not appear greatly changed from 10 years ago, for example, colistin and newly-synthesized aminoglycoside were rather sensitive. In addition a review was conducted of related papers of the past 70 years with a discussion of some controversial problems.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results were as follow: 1. A total of 27 patients consisting of 17 mature and 10 immature infants were treated with IPM/CS. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, and it was administered 2 approximately 3 times daily, in a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 approximately 12 days. The clinical efficacy of IPM/CS in 10 patients with bacterial infections (2 with sepsis, 3 with suspected sepsis, 2 with pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with acute omphalitis) was evaluated as excellent in all patients, with an efficacy rate of 100%. All 5 causative organisms found in 5 patients (Staphylococcus aureus in 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Escherichia coli in 2 and Flavobacterium meningosepticum in 1) were eradicated. Among 27 patients administered IPM/CS, adverse reactions were observed in 2 patients. These were rash and diarrhea. As for abnormal laboratory test values, elevations of GOT and GPT were observed. 2. MICs of IPM against 14 clinical isolates (S. epidermidis 1, S. aureus 6, Streptococcus agalactiae 4, E. coli 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1 and F. meningosepticum 1) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. IPM showed good antibacterial activity comparable to that of cefotaxime against S. agalactiae; however, the activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus was poor. 3. Serum levels of IPM and CS were investigated in a total of 22 patients consisting of 15 mature and 7 immature infants after 20 mg/20 mg/kg of IPM/CS was administered. IPM and CS produced peak serum levels at the end of the drip infusion. In mature infants, peak serum levels of IPM and CS were 31.8 micrograms/ml (17.1 approximately 59.0 micrograms/ml) and 59.9 micrograms/ml (35.6 approximately 99.0 micrograms/ml), respectively. In low birth weight infants, these were 25.0 micrograms/ml (16.8 approximately 41.8 micrograms/ml) and 55.2 micrograms/ml (33.8 approximately 82.4 micrograms/ml), respectively. Half-lives of IPM and CS were 1.0 approximately 2.7 hrs. and 0.9 approximately 7.4 hrs. in mature infants, and 1.6 approximately 3.0 hrs. and 1.3 approximately 9.7 hrs. in immature infants, respectively. Generally the longer half-lives were observed in the younger neonates. Serum levels of CS remained higher and half-lives of CS were longer than those of IPM. The pharmacokinetics in neonates were different from those in adults or children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vivo pH of induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice.
AB  - Infections in the diabetic host have been shown to persist longer than those in the nondiabetic host. To investigate whether intra-abscess milieu might be a contributing factor to this persistence, the in vivo intra-abscess pH was measured in induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. Two models (female genetically obese insulin-resistant and male streptozocin-induced diabetic mice) were used with appropriate controls. The bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus (B + E), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus (S + E), and S. aureus (SA). Intra-abscess pH measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. In the diabetic mice, the pH of an abscess induced with B + E, S + E, and SA was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the pH in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. Differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. The blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. No animals were ketotic. There were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. In conclusion, there is a significantly lower pH in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Results of intraoperative bacteriological studies of bile from patients operated on for cholelithiasis].
AB  - Complete bacteriological examination of bile was carried out in 123 patients operated on for cholecystolithiasis. The most frequently found Gram-negative bacteria were E. coli and Klebsiella species. The Gram-positive organisms were most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis, Str. viridans and Str. faecalis. Anaerobes were rarely found. The effectiveness of the antibiotics used was studied.
TI  - [The effect of aortic valve translocation and a few problems].
AB  - Aortic valve endocarditis is frequently associated with an aortic root abscess, so that it is difficult to insert a prosthetic valve. Between April, 1983 and June, 1988 we treated four out of seven patients with aortic valve endocarditis by translocation of the aortic valve, closure of the native coronary ostia, and placement of saphenous vein grafts on the coronary arteries. In each case, the operation was undertaken because of rapidly progressing heart failure. Infection was due to alpha-Streptococcus in two instances, to Staphylococcus epidermidis and fungus in the other cases. In one of the four patients, the prosthetic aortic valve was sutured to the ascending aorta and two saphenous vein grafts were placed on the proximal coronary arteries. In the other three patients, the composite Woven Dacron graft was used to replace the ascending aorta and two saphenous vein grafts were placed on the distal coronary arteries. One patient died one year postoperatively of LOS because of rapidly progressing coronary grafts ostial stenosis. The other three patients survived and doing well with satisfactory hemodynamic function and no infection. Translocation of the aortic valve for infective aortic valve endocarditis is a useful operative technique when conventional aortic valve replacement technique cannot be utilize.
TI  - [Clinical evaluations of surgical treatment of infective endocarditis].
AB  - This paper shows the clinical evaluations of surgical and medical treatment of infective endocarditis (IE). IE occurred in 33 cases (10.1%) among 372 cases of valve replacement. Of all the 33 patients, IE was consisted of native valve endocarditis (NVE) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). IE was evaluated as for the microorganism, complication, operative indication and operative mortality. At first, all of NVE underwent surgical treatment, active phase endocarditis 4 and healed endocarditis 14. Microorganism was streptococcus aureus in an overwhelming majority. Operative indications was congestive heart failure in almost all cases, next to vegetation and infection resistant to medical treatment. Operative mortality was 5.6% (1 out of 18 cases), which case was in the septic shock and cerebral bleeding prior to the surgical treatment. The others was satisfactory condition postoperatively. Next of PVE, PVE happened in 15 cases, in which there were 5 cases of bioprosthetic PVE and 10 cases of mechanical valve PVE. Microorganism for PVE was staphylococcus epidermidis in the major part (60%). Mortality in PVE was 53.3% (8 out of 15), but mechanical valve PVE was worse in prognosis than bioprosthetic PVE. Cerebral complications occurred in 3 cases of mechanical valve PVE, on the other hand there was no cerebral complication in bioprosthetic PVE. As for the hemodynamic change in PVE, mechanical valve PVE had the tendency to take the prompt or sudden deterioration of hemodynamics caused by endocarditis surrounding the suture ring, especially in mitral position, on the contrary hemodynamic deterioration was gradually proceeded in bioprosthetic PVE. UCG made much of the diagnosis of PVE, especially in mechanical valve PVE, in which cases endocarditis was recognized only surrounding the suture ring. PVE takes the miserable outcome in many cases, so carefully observation is necessary in order not to lose the timing of the surgical treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic SKF104662.
AB  - The inhibitory activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic SKF104662 was generally equivalent (+/- 1 concentration increment) to the activities of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin against selected gram-positive bacteria. However, SKF104662 demonstrated greater activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. haemolyticus than did teicoplanin and was more active than the other drugs against Clostridium difficile isolates. SKF104662 possessed bactericidal activity quite similar to that of vancomycin against selected isolates of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus species.
TI  - [Spondylodiscitis disclosing bacterial endocarditis. Apropos of a case. Review of the literature].
AB  - The authors report a case of infectious spondylodiscitis revealing a staphylococcal endocarditis in a patient with a Carpentier aortic heterograft. This case, along with 60 descriptions from the literature, has enabled them to specify the characteristics of occurrence of endocarditis during a spondylodiscitis. The clinical factors in favor of this association are: a pre-existing cardiopathy, an oral port of entry, occurrence of other rheumatoid manifestations, even more the presence of complications of endocarditis. The laboratory factors in favor of an association are: discovery of an inflammatory anemia, of circulating immune complexes, of a cryoglobulinemia, of a rheumatoid factor, of hematuria. But it is mostly the demonstration of streptococcus in blood cultures and other samples that should be an indication to search for an endocarditis, the course of which dominates the prognosis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids from normal and essential fatty  acid-deficient mice.
AB  - Among the cutaneous effects of an essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet are  hyperdesquamation, increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and altered lipid profiles, characteristics also common to inflammatory dermatoses. Because fatty acids are antimicrobial, we examined the indigenous skin flora of normal and EFAD hairless mice, and compared the antimicrobial efficacy of lipids extracted from their stratum corneum. EFAD mice supported 100-fold more bacteria than normal mice, and were the only group from which Staphylococcus aureus were routinely isolated. Despite this greater carriage, in vitro experiments demonstrated that EFAD lipids are more lethal than normal lipids against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp., and a coryneform. Skin fungi were equally susceptible to both extracts. After thin layer chromatography, the most active fractions were found to be glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. EFAD extracts had 35% more free fatty acids and 75% more glycosphingolipids; normal extracts had more triglycerides and phospholipids. S. aureus strain 502A survived equally well on EFAD as on normal mice. Normal lipids applied on EFAD mice had no additional effect, but EFAD lipids on normal mice brought about a 35% reduction of the inoculated bacteria. If the mice were pretreated with alcohol, carriage of strain 502A was reduced by 71%. If instead the mice were previously washed with acetone to increase TEWL, a 97% reduction of the staphylococcus occurred. The application of normal flora to such acetone-washed mice decreased the efficacy to 76%. EFAD and normal lipids on human subjects were equally ineffective in eliminating strain 502A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  - To study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptor (FcRlo, CR1, and CR3)-mediated phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups A and B streptococci were examined. IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combinations of FCE 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. The combination of FCE 22101 and gentamicin against Streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. Against Enterobacter cloacae FCE 22101 had MICs of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the MICs were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. Ciprofloxacin and FCE 22101 showed only addition against Enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of FCE 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against Citrobacter freundii. With Serratia spp. FCE 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but FCE 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. Similar results were obtained with strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providencia spp. FCE 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against Ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. In general the combination of FCE 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Bacteriology of otitis media with effusion.
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria present in the middle ear of patients with otitis media with effusion. Middle ear effusions (MEE), nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were obtained at operation and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Two hundred and fifty-nine effusions were obtained from 152 subjects examined. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated from 32 (12.3 per cent) effusions, Streptococcus pneumoniae from seven (2.7 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus from seven (2.7 per cent), Branhamella catarrhalis from one (0.4 per cent)--Group A beta haemolytic streptococci from one (0.4 per cent) and Staphylococcus epidermidis from three (1.9 per cent). The occurrence of respiratory pathogens in MEE reflected their prevalence in the upper respiratory tract. Significantly fewer children who had received antibiotics prior to surgery had organisms present in the MEE. Eight and a half per cent of H. influenzae and 64 per cent of B. catarrhalis were resistant to ampicillin. The present study confirms that bacteria are present in the middle ear in a significant number of patients with otitis media with effusion.
TI  - Intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  - One hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. Of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). Significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. Eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common isolates. Six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. This review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.
TI  - Nisin, a peptide antibiotic: cloning and sequencing of the nisA gene and posttranslational processing of its peptide product.
AB  - Nisin produced by Streptococcus lactis is used as a food preservative and is the  most important member of a group of antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges. To understand the genetic basis of these so-called lantibiotics (Schnell et al., Nature 333:276-278, 1988), we characterized the nisin structural gene, nisA, which is located on a plasmid and codes for a 57-amino-acid prepeptide. The prepeptide is processed posttranslationally to the pentacyclic antibiotic. Although nisin and the recently elucidated lantibiotic epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis are produced by different organisms, their gene organization is identical. As with epidermin, the nisin propeptide corresponds to the C-terminus of the prepeptide. The N-terminus of the prepeptide is cleaved at a characteristic splice site (Pro--2 Arg--1 Ile-+1). Remarkably, the N-terminus of prenisin shares 70% similarity with preepidermin, although the propeptide sequences are distinctly different. The structural similarities between these two lantibiotics are consistent with the fact that there is a common mechanism of biosynthesis of these lanthionine-containing antibiotics.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  - Soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees C underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of pH from 6.5 to 4.5. Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter diversus and Bacillus brevis, and the yeasts Pichia burtonii, Candida didensiae and Rhodotorula rubra. Fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures of these isolates showed L. casei, Strep. faecium and Staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the pH reduction. Soybeans were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation. Boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
TI  - Arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the pH response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  - Thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the pH by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. Only Actinomyces naeslundii and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant pH-rise activity with all three compounds. Eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. Only one, Actinomyces viscosus, produced a pH-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. The remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. The ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. Substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce pH-fall-pH-rise responses shaped like those of the Stephen curve in vivo. In general, addition of arginolytic bacteria made these in vitro pH responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. Because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. Similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a pH-fall-pH-rise type of response. When increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic Lactobacillus casei or Streptococcus mutans, the pH minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the pH-rise became progressively and significantly less. Thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the pH response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. A large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - Neonatal septicaemia in Finland 1981-85. Predominance of group B streptococcal infections with very early onset.
AB  - A survey of blood culture-confirmed neonatal septicaemia was carried out in seven delivery hospitals in 1981-85, for a second successive five-year period. The total number of cases was 377, to compare with 410 in the previous five-year period. Group B streptococcus (GBS) was throughout the major pathogen (29%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Escherichia coli (14%), while Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%) has emerged as a significant new causative agent. Septicaemia with very early onset was predominant: 49% of the cases had onset within the first 24 hours; in the majority the symptoms were present from birth. GBS was responsible for 49% of the cases detected in the first 24 hours of life. The overall mortality was 20% as compared to 23% in the previous five-year period, whereas in the very early onset septicaemia mortality was now 18%, down from the preceding 30%. Despite the modest progress, GBS septicaemia with very early onset remains a significant problem, and effective preventive measures are needed.
TI  - Infection of hemodialysis catheters: incidence and mechanisms.
AB  - Fifty-three consecutive subclavian or jugular hemodialysis catheters inserted into 41 patients were prospectively studied over a period of 8 months in order to determine the incidence of infection and its mechanisms. The intravascular, intradermal and the Y catheter segments as well as both connections were cultured using a quantitative technique for the intraluminal surface. In addition, the intravascular and intradermal portions of the catheter were cultured using a semiquantitative technique for the external surface. Skin smears of the catheter entry site were also cultured, and blood cultures were similarly obtained if fewer developed. Twenty-nine of the 53 catheters (55%) were significantly colonized by one (19 cases) or more (10 cases) microorganisms. The source of the colonizing microorganisms was the skin in 17 cases (58%), intraluminal in 5 (17%), both routes in 5 (17%) and others in 2 (6.8%). Staphylococcus epidermidis (22 cases) and Staphylococcus aureus (4 cases) were the bacteria most frequently isolated. Nine of the 53 catheterizations (17%) were complicated by catheter-related septicemia due to S. aureus in 4 cases, S. epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 1 and Proteus vulgaris in 1. Catheter-related bacteremia contributed to a patient's death in 1 case. Suppurative local infections of the catheter entry site developed in 3 cases, 2 of them with septicemia. We conclude that the rate of infection due to subclavian or jugular hemodialysis catheters is very high and that the skin is the most frequent origin of the microorganisms.
TI  - The etiology of bacterial cellulitis as determined by fine-needle aspiration.
AB  - Bacterial cellulitis is a common problem, etiologic diagnosis often unrewarding and opinions differ on empiric therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the major microbiologic causes of bacterial cellulitis in a walk-in Emergency Room setting. 94 cases in 89 patients with clinical signs of cellulitis were studied. The infection was closed in 74 cases and associated with an open skin lesion in 22. The infection site was aspirated with a suction air-buffer technique employing a Cameco handle for easier handling and stabilization of the aspiration needle. After exclusion of contaminated samples, positive cultures were obtained from 30 cases (31.9%). Cultures were positive in 30.6% of open lesions and in 36.4% of closed ones. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, present in 11 cases, S. epidermidis in 8 and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in 5. All S. aureus strains were methicillin-sensitive and only 1 was sensitive to penicillin. The most common site of infection was the lower extremity (59%). According to these data the optimal initial therapy for bacterial cellulitis in adults should be with drugs active against both staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial corneal ulcers among Arabs in Kuwait.
AB  - A retrospective clinicomicrobiological study of 228 patients with bacterial corneal ulcers was performed. Positive cultures of corneal ulcer samples were obtained from 68% of all patients. A high incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from patients' ulcers, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus were the next most frequent pathogens. Of some help in identifying the causative organism were the locations of the ulcer, the presence or absence of hypopyon and the frequency of perforation of the ulcer. Cephaloridine, gentamicin and polymyxin were found to be the most effective therapy. Gram strains of ulcer samples were positive for organisms in only 13% of patients and accordingly were not considered useful in determining initial therapy of ulcers. Since corneal and conjunctival cultures in the majority of the control group were negative, one can presume that most of the S. epidermidis isolated from patients' ulcers was exogenous in nature.
TI  - Therapy of serious gram-positive infections with teicoplanin.
AB  - Teicoplanin was used as monotherapy in 17 seriously ill patients (mean age 51 years, range 18-71) with infection due to Gram-positive organisms. The dose used was 200 mg teicoplanin intravenously once daily after an initial intravenous dose of 400 mg. Most of the patients (15 out of 17) were septicaemic (confirmed by blood culture), the other two had deep abscesses. The pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis [15], Streptococcus faecium [1] and JK Coryneform [1]. The 15 patients with Staph. epidermidis infections had all been treated previously with a beta-lactam (usually flucloxacillin)/aminoglycoside combination to which Staph. epidermidis was resistant. All patients were still pyrexial after 48 h of therapy and were then changed to teicoplanin as monotherapy. Patients were treated with teicoplanin for 5 to 7 days. One was withdrawn because of vomiting associated with the teicoplanin infusion, and another was withdrawn because she was given amikacin for a separate Gram-negative infection, but all the other 15 patients responded well to therapy, usually becoming apyrexial within 48 h. All 15 septicaemic patients had central lines in situ: 10 responded to therapy with the line left in situ but in 5 the lines were removed, either before or during teicoplanin therapy. Teicoplanin levels were determined in all patients, usually on day 2, with no evidence of toxicity from these levels. Teicoplanin was found to be effective as monotherapy for septicaemia mainly due to Staph. epidermidis in patients with severe underlying disease.
TI  - Survival of Streptococcus viridans in gentamicin-supplemented McCarey-Kaufman medium.
AB  - Our experience with three cases of Streptococcus viridans endophthalmitis, following penetrating keratoplasty, prompted us to investigate the ability of gentamicin-supplemented McCarey-Kaufman (M-K) medium to kill S. viridans contaminants. After inoculation of 20 cc of gentamicin-supplemented M-K with S. viridans, the M-K was exposed to temperature conditions similar to those that would be encountered by a donor cornea during storage (4 degrees C) and preoperative warming prior to keratoplasty (23 degrees C). Colony counts were performed at regular intervals. After 1 h of warming, no reduction in the initial inoculum had occurred. This is in contrast to results from similar experiments with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in which more than 1 log unit of killing occurred after 1 h. While previously reported clinical experience has demonstrated an overall low incidence of postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis using gentamicin-supplemented M-K, our own recent clinical and laboratory data suggest that additional or alternate antibiotic coverage for S. viridans may be prudent.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [A clinical evaluation of sultamicillin fine granules in the treatment of meibomianitis].
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. A dose of 375 mg SBTPC granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. The results obtained are summarized as follows. Efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. No side effects were observed throughout the study. The organisms isolated were Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Streptococcus sanguis, and Gram-negative bacteria such as Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. xylosoxidans, Xanthomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter lwoffii. A bacteriological study showed lower MICs of SBTPC than those of ampicillin (ABPC), suggesting that SBTPC has more potent antibacterial activity than ABPC. Such bacteriological activity of SBTPC was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to ABPC or cefaclor.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus in otitis media with effusion.
AB  - Bacteriologic investigation of middle ear effusion (MEE), external ear canal, and the nasopharynx was carried out on 458 patients with otitis media with effusion. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common bacteria in MEE, even after excluding the contaminants from the external ear canal, which had the same value of minimal inhibitory concentration as the paired MEE. The bacterial agreement of S epidermidis between MEE and the nasopharynx was extremely rare in contrast with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, although the organism was also frequently isolated from the nasopharynx. Staphylococcus aureus, having the same minimal inhibitory concentration as that in the nasopharynx, was more frequently found in MEE than S epidermidis. The results suggest that S epidermidis found in MEE is not a pathogen, but rather a contaminant in many instances. Staphylococcus aureus seems to be a causative agent in otitis media with effusion.
TI  - Serous otitis media (S.O.M.). A bacteriological study of the ear canal and the middle ear.
AB  - A bacteriological study of the middle-ear effusions and the ear canals in children with chronic serous otitis media (S.O.M.) was performed. Sixty-eight children (127 ears) were investigated. From this study it appeared that cleansing of the ear canal with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol for 30 s is partially effective; micro-organisms (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis) could still be isolated in 29%. Cleansing of the ear canal decreases the incidence of middle-ear fluid contamination by non-pathogenic ear canal organisms (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus), but after cleansing, 'non-pathogenic' micro-organisms could still be isolated in 33% of the effusions (diptheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis). From 12% of the middle-ear effusions pathogenic micro-organisms (Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus pneumoniae) were isolated; cleansing of the ear canal did not influence this percentage. Anaerobics were not isolated from the middle-ear effusions.
TI  - Bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. The authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from January 1983 to March 1986 at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. All patients were followed for at least 6 months. Clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. The causative organisms among those patients included: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); Staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); Hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); Moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). In addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. Herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). Statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (P less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (P less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (P less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (P less than 0.0001). The authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.
TI  - Prospective evaluation of bacterial antigen detection in cerebral spinal fluid in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in a predominantly adult hospital.
AB  - The results of all CSF latex agglutination (LA) tests performed in a large predominantly adult hospital over 1 yr are reviewed. Eight cases of bacterial meningitis were recognized during this time, and of these only three were due to organisms detectable by commercially available LA kits. In one case, the LA was uninterpretable, and in the second the LA was not performed because less than 5 x 10(6) WBC/L were seen in the CSF. In the third case the Gram stain was positive. No cases of partially treated meningitis were diagnosed. In this setting, the LA test did not contribute significantly to patient management.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis susceptibility to amiloride depends on medium pH.
AB  - Amiloride is one of the major molecular probes in basic and applied investigations on the physiology of cation transport in animal cells. In these cells the drug also exerts growth inhibitory activity. Recently, we discovered that amiloride causes growth inhibition also on bacterial cells. In this paper we report that medium pH influences amiloride activity on Streptococcus faecalis. The lowering of external pH causes a drop in the susceptibility of this bacterium to amiloride up to an almost complete resistance. This finding, constitutes a novel aspect of the in vitro experimental pharmacology of this diuretic potentially useful also in clinical pharmacology and in animal cell investigations.
TI  - Effects of fibronectin on the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with unopsonized and antibody-opsonized bacteria.
AB  - Fibronectin (Fn) affects the interaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)  with certain bacteria. Fn alone enhanced the response, in a chemiluminescence (CL) assay, of PMNLs to Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .05) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .01) but had no effect on type III, group B streptococci (GBS) or Escherichia coli. When GBS or E. coli were first preopsonized in antibody, Fn significantly enhanced the CL response of PMNLs (P less than .05). The intracellular metabolic inhibitor NaN3 but not the extracellular scavengers superoxide dismutase or human serum albumin inhibited Fn-enhanced CL; this fact suggests that enhancement of the respiratory burst by Fn is an intracellular event. We used an acridine orange-crystal violet monolayer assay to examine the effects of Fn on ingestion and intracellular killing of bacteria by PMNLs. Fn alone promoted uptake and killing of S. aureus (P less than .01) and S. epidermidis (P less than .05) by PMNLs but did not enhance monolayer phagocytosis of GBS or E. coli, unless these bacteria were preopsonized in antibody (P less than .01).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of ME1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1207 (pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ME1206) is a new oral cephalosporin. ME1206 is (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)- acetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-ethyl]-cephem-4-carboxy lic acid. The susceptibilities of about 1,600 clinical isolates to ME1206 were determined by the agar dilution method. ME1206 showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ME1206 was more active than cefaclor, T-2525, and cefixime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of ME1206 was comparable with that of T-2525, but ME1206 was less active than cefixime. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, ME1206 had high activity (MIC, less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml). ME1206 was stable against various beta-lactamases, except beta-lactamases from Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Escherichia coli W3630 (Rms213). The 50% effective doses of ME1207 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were comparable with those of T-2588 against gram-negative bacteria and about one-fourth that of T-2588 against Staphylococcus aureus Smith.
TI  - [Clinical examination of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor on chronic respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor), a granule form of cefaclor, was performed in 20 patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The patients subjected to the study consisted of 11 males and 9 females with ages between 44 and 76 years. S 6472 was given orally to each patient in a daily dose of 750 mg in 2 divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 days in 1 case, 7 days in 11 cases, 11 days in 3 cases and 14 days in 5 cases. A total of 5 strains including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified from sputum samples before the administration of the drug. All strains were eradicated but, instead 2 strains, 1 strain each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared after the therapy. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.0% (19/20): Excellent in 5 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case. No side effects were observed, but eosinophilia was observed in 1 case. From the above results, it appeared that S 6472 was effective, safe and useful agent for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Structural relationships between senfolomycins and paulomycins.
AB  - Senfolomycins A and B (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.-1965: 828-831, 1966) are two antibacterial agents with physico-chemical and biological properties similar to those of paulomycin. Recent studies indicate that senfolomycin A (C29H36N2O16S, MW 700) has molecular composition and fast atom bombardment MS fragmentation pattern identical to those of paulomycin E. Extensive NMR work indicates that the two antibiotics, which have been separated by HPLC and TLC, differ only in the stereochemistry of the OCH3 group present in their respective sugar moieties. Indirect evident suggests that senfolomycin B is dihydrosenfolomycin A (C29H38N2O16S, MW 702) and in this respect it is related to paulomycin F. The proposed structures for senfolomycins A and B are discussed.
TI  - Therapy of acute and chronic gram-negative osteomyelitis with ciprofloxacin. Report from a Swedish Study Group.
AB  - Oral ciprofloxacin was used at doses ranging from 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily for 15 to 476 (mean 139) days for treatment of acute or chronic osteomyelitis in 38 patients, and acute arthritis in two. Clinical efficacy could be evaluated in 34 patients; 22 had resolution of their osteomyelitis, five improved and there were seven failures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the causative agent in 28 patients. It was eradicated in 22 patients, persisted but remained sensitive to ciprofloxacin in three and persisted with emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin in three. Nineteen other pathogens, five Gram-negative and 14 Gram-positive, were isolated. Of those, one strain of Staphylococcus aureus, two of Staph. epidermidis and three of Streptococcus faecalis remained sensitive to ciprofloxacin during treatment. In one patient, Slr. faecalis persisted with emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin. Ten adverse events related to ciprofloxacin treatment were observed in nine patients; two phototoxic reactions, two cases of impaired colour vision, and one each of exanthema, abdominal pain, malaise, drug fever, peripheral neuropathy and eosinophilia. In three patients the adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin seems to offer an oral alternative to injectible antibiotics in patients with osteomyelitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the cyclic lipopeptide LY 146032 (daptomycin).
AB  - In vitro activity of the new cyclic lipopeptide LY 146032 (daptomycin, Eli Lilly) was evaluated against 67 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 15 clinical isolates of S. epidermidis and 80 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis. Activity was best against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY 146032 0.25-0.5 mg/l). Minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations were of similar value. LY 146032 requires physiological concentrations of Ca++ ion for the expression of antibacterial activity. Results of the time-kill curves indicated that exposure to a concentration of the antibiotic equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration abolished recovery in the strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis investigated. Response by S. faecalis was less predictable although most S. faecalis strains were killed in vitro by LY 146032 concentrations of less than or equal to 8 mg/l which is within the predicted clinically achievable range.
TI  - Neonatal septicaemia in Kelantan, Malaysia.
AB  - A retrospective study of 84 cases of neonatal septicaemia admitted into a neonatal unit in a rural area of Malaysia for 1 year between 1st September 1985 to 31st August 1986 was carried out to determine the spectrum of micro-organisms and predisposing factors in relation to early and late onset septicaemia. The incidence of neonatal septicaemia was 2.13 per 1,000 live-births per year and the case fatality was 41.7% with higher case fatality in those who were premature, those who presented as early onset and those who had gram negative septicaemia. The mean age of onset of septicaemia was 7.8 days (range from 2 hours to 27 days). Forty four (52%) neonates had early onset septicaemia with mean age of onset at 2.7 days; forty (48%) neonates had late onset septicaemia presenting at 13.6 days of life. Gram negative organisms such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, sp., E. coli and Streptococcus, especially group B Streptococcus were the major organisms in the early onset septicaemia. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the major organisms responsible for the late onset septicaemia. Obstetrical factors played an important role in early onset septicaemia. Prematurity was the most common predisposing factor. Invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including surgery highlighted once again the importance of these procedures in predisposing the newborn to infection.
TI  - Reversal of activity of trimethoprim against gram-positive cocci by thymidine, thymine and 'folates'.
AB  - The reversal of the antibacterial activity of trimethoprim against different species of Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus, group B streptococci, Streptococcus faecalis and Str. faecium) by thymine, thymidine and various 'folates' (folate, folinate, dihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate) was tested. Against group B streptococci and staphylococci only thymidine antagonized trimethoprim. However, for enterococci, thymine, thymidine, dihydrofolate, tetrahydrofolate and folinate all reversed the activity of trimethoprim, although by different amounts. Dihydrofolate was significantly more effective as a trimethoprim antagonist for Str. faecium than for Str. faecalis. While thymine and thymidine caused the MIC of trimethoprim against enterococci to increase more than 100-fold--thereby rendering them resistant--the 'folates' brought about much smaller increases in trimethoprim MIC, in the order of ten-fold only. Thus, even in the presence of 'folates' enterococci remain sensitive in vitro to trimethoprim.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Activity and mechanism of action of DuP 105 and DuP 721, new oxazolidinone compounds.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of DuP 721 and DuP 105, new oxazolidinone antibacterials, were compared with those of cefazolin, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, oxacillin, penicillin, and vancomycin against Gram-positive cocci. DuP 721 was approximately four-fold more active than DuP 105 with an MIC of 2.0 mg/l for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococcus and Streptococcus faecalis strains tested, and an MIC of 4.0 mg/l for 90% of the Str. faecium, penicillin-resistant Str. pneumoniae and viridans streptococcus strains tested. DuP 105 was most active against strains of Staph. epidermidis with an MIC of 4.0 mg/l for 90% of the strains tested. There was no cross resistance between these and the other antibacterial agents that were tested. Both oxazolidinones had bacteriostatic activity in broth against susceptible organisms. Both DuP 721 and DuP 105 inhibited ribosomal protein synthesis in a cell-free system. These synthetic, orally absorbable compounds represent a new series of antibacterial agents unrelated by chemical structure to any other currently available antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension during three types of gram-positive bacteremia in piglets.
AB  - Thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group B streptococcus (GBS), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. We postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as Streptococcus fecalis (ENT) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. We observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of GBS, Ent, and S. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). Pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous pO2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for Ent and S. epi. In 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, GBS: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm Hg/liter/min, Ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm Hg/liter/min, S. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm Hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane B2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, GBS: 30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, Ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, S. epi: 31 +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). This dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm Hg). The thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced TxB2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. We conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.
TI  - Origin of organisms infecting ventricular shunts.
AB  - Results of skin cultures obtained before 413 of 505 operations for cerebrospinal  fluid-diverting ventricular shunt placement or revision in a pediatric population from April 1980 to May 1983 are analyzed and compared to results of cultures from 20 subsequent shunt infections. Sensitivities to 11 different antibiotics were determined for each isolate cultured. The total operative infection rate was 20 of 505 (4%). Gram-negative bacilli alone accounted for 3 of 20 (15%) shunt infections. One gram-negative bacillus/Staphylococcus aureus infection occurred. Factors predisposing for gram-negative bacillus shunt infection were found in all 4 cases. The majority of shunt infections were caused by typical resident skin organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis alone, 9/20 (45%); Staphylococcus aureus alone, 4/20 (20%); Corynebacterium sp., 1/20 (5%); alpha-Streptococcus with S. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%); and Micrococcus with S. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%). Only 4 (20%) of the 20 shunt infections were due to organisms identical to those originally grown from the skin. Another 4 (20%) seemed to be infected with a strain of organism different from that initially recovered from the skin. The remaining skin organism shunt infections may or may not have come from the patient's skin. The data suggest that not all skin organism shunt infections arise from contamination by resident skin bacteria at the incision sites at the time of operation. Alternate sources for the infecting organisms are discussed. The antibiotic sensitivity data on skin isolates and shunt isolates suggest that vancomycin is the antibiotic best suited for prophylaxis against shunt infection at our institution.
TI  - [Treatment of peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with intraperitoneal ceftriaxone].
AB  - In 16 patients under CAPD, 29 cases of bacterial peritonitis were observed, with  clinical manifestations in 23. The mean cell count in peritoneal dialysis fluid was 5608/mm3 with 4991/mm3 polymorphonuclear, Leukocytes Causative pathogens were Staphylococcus in 14 cases, Streptococcus in 6, Bacillus in one, Enterobacteria in 5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 and Moraxella in 1. Three cultures were negative. First choice treatment was a daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 g of ceftriaxone. 79.3% of patients recovered within 5 days. Failure were due to a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in one case, a Streptococcus faecalis in two cases, and a Staphylococcus aureus in three observations, which two were responsible of abscess round catheter peritoneal. Mean ceftriaxone concentrations 24 hours after the intraperitoneal injection were 50.6 mg/l (range: 3.3-141 mg/l) in serum and 58.1 mg/l (range: 4.3-180 mg/l) in dialysate. These concentrations are greater than most of ceftriaxone's MICs for susceptible bacteria, a finding that confirm the value of treatment with a single daily intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone.
TI  - [Efficacy of teicoplanin in 25 cases of severe infections caused by gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 25 severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria alone [13], in combination [9], alone then in combination [3], in an open study. Of 22 infections that could be evaluated, there were 18 cures and improvements (81.8%), 2 recurrence and 2 failures. Serum concentrations are unpredictable and steady after 5 days i.v. teicoplanin. Trough and peak concentrations are respectively less than 5 mg/l and less than 20 mg/l in 13 infections and higher in 9, unrelated with success or failure. A trough concentration greater than CMI and kind of infection seem deciding. The choice of the antibiotic combined with teicoplanin warrant more data.
TI  - In vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, DuP 721 and DuP 105.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of DuP 105 and 1 microgram of DuP 721 per ml. DuP 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus groups A, B, C, F, and G at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium group JK species, anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium spp. including Clostridium difficile. They did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the MIC for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates was 8 micrograms of DuP 721 per ml.
TI  - Infections by gram-positive bacteria: an overview.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, which has exceptional ability to cause disease in man, has responded to the introductions of antimicrobial agents by the selection and emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. There have been cyclical changes in the prevalence of these strains in nosocomial infections. Other Gram-positive species that give rise to concern, for related reasons, are Staph. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis and the JK group of corynebacteria. These problems are discussed to provide a background for the contributions that follow.
TI  - Effect of ofloxacin on oral and gastrointestinal microflora in patients undergoing gastric surgery.
AB  - The effect of ofloxacin on the microflora in saliva, gastric juice, and feces was evaluated in 24 patients undergoing gastric surgery. A single peroral dose of 400 mg ofloxacin was given to each patient 2-4 h before surgery. The concentrations of ofloxacin in serum, saliva, gastric juice, and gastric mucosa tissue were assayed. Only Branhamella cocci were affected in the saliva. In the gastric juice, both the aerobic and anaerobic flora were suppressed on the day of surgery, but increased in number afterwards. There was a significant correlation between gastric pH and the number of microorganisms isolated in the gastric juice on day 0. In faeces, the aerobic and part of the anaerobic flora were suppressed by the administration of ofloxacin. Ofloxacin was well tolerated by the patients. Four of 24 patients developed postoperative complications. Microorganisms isolated from wound sepsis and intraabdominal sepsis (three patients) were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci group A, Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli. All related infections occurred in patients with very low ofloxacin serum concentrations, probably due to impaired absorption. Oral antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom impaired gastric emptying can be expected.
TI  - [Preventive antibiotic administration in complicated rhinosurgical interventions--a double-blind study].
AB  - Revision rhinoplasty was performed in 100 patients. In most cases a complete rhinoplasty with septal reconstruction, osteotomies, wedge resection and free transplants had to be done. Intranasal swabs for bacterial culture were taken pre- and postoperatively. 48 patients received three mega units of propicillin transorally for 12 days, 52 patients received a placebo. White blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and temperature were taken to indicate inflammation of the nasal region. Turbid nasal secretion, reddening and swelling of the nasal linings, and bleeding of the noninjured nasal mucosa were taken as clinical signs of infection. Preoperatively staphylococcus epidermidis was cultured in 69% from the nasal cavities, staphylococcus aureus in 42%, streptococci in 24%, diphtheroids in 22% etc. (see Table 1). Serious infections developed in six patients (five of them without antibiotics), more localized infections in twelve patients (nine of them without antibiotics). Some of the infections developed after removal of the nasal packing. In five patients with serious infections either streptococcus viridans or streptococcus pneumoniae could be cultured preoperatively. In three of five cases the streptococci were propicillin-sensitive. Clinical signs and laboratory parameters were not helpful in identifying patients with infections. We conclude that patients undergoing revision rhinosurgery should be followed carefully for at least two weeks. Postoperative administration of propicillin appears to be able to prevent serious nasal infections especially if free transplants are used.
TI  - The effects of sinus bacteria on human ciliated nasal epithelium in vitro.
AB  - The mechanisms by which bacteria colonize and damage ciliated epithelium are important in understanding the pathophysiology of rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis. Bacteria that have the ability to impair mucociliary clearance would be at an advantage in establishing infection of ciliated surfaces. This study investigates the effect of Hemophilus Influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis on the ciliary activity of normal ciliated nasal epithelium in human beings. Ciliary activity of the nasal epithelium in the presence of each pathogen was assessed for more than 240 minutes with a photometric method of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) measurement. H. influenzae exerted significant effects on ciliary activity, with a 46% decrease in the CBF by 4 hours (with bacteria-containing broth) and a 32% decrease with bacteria-free filtrate. S. epidermidis decreased CBF by 44% with the bacterial broth. A sterile cell-free filtrate had no significant effect. S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis had no significant effect on CBF within a 240-minute period. H. influenzae and S. epidermidis disrupted normal synchronous ciliary motion, causing adjacent cilia to beat at different rates.
TI  - Efficacy of teicoplanin as antimicrobial treatment of severe nosocomial infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a preliminary study.
AB  - We used single daily intravenous teicoplanin as therapy for 12 severe nosocomial  infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. A daily dosage of 3-6 mg/kg was usually adopted; however, in selected cases the dosage was increased to 8-9.5 mg/day on the basis of serum bactericidal monitoring. Most of these infections were life-threatening and included ventriculitis/meningitis (3 cases), sepsis (3 cases), mediastinitis (1 case) and extensive burn wound infection (1 case). Staphylococcus aureus was by far the most frequent pathogen and methicillin-resistant strains were isolated in 7 out of 9 infections caused by this organism. The remaining isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, JK Corynebacterium, Streptococcus agalactiae and Propionilbacterium acnes. Additional antibiotics were used in 5 cases for concomitant gram-negative bacillus etiology (2 cases), granulocytopenia (2 cases), superinfection (1 case). Overall a clinical success and microbial eradication were documented in 100% and 91% of 12 cases, respectively. Except one case of fever, no other major adverse effect was observed and no patient required trial therapy discontinuation. In conclusion, our preliminary data seem to suggest a satisfactory activity of teicoplanin against nosocomial gram-positive infections.
TI  - Clinical laboratory challenges in the recognition of Leuconostoc spp.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus salivarius-like bacteria were isolated from the blood and gastrostomy tube of a 6-month-old child during vancomycin therapy for Staphylococcus epidermidis central venous catheter-associated bacteremia. The isolates produced D-(-)-lactate and ethanol from glucose, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced no ammonia from arginine, thus fulfilling the major criteria as Leuconostoc spp. The enzymatic profile of the bacteria suggested that they were not lactobacilli or streptococci. Resistance to vancomycin and penicillin tolerance were noted. The formula fed through the gastrostomy tube was suspected as the vehicle that transmitted the organism to the patient. Penicillin and tobramycin therapy was used successfully.
TI  - Outcome of infected total hip arthroplasty. An inclusive, consecutive series.
AB  - Twenty-one infected total hip arthroplasties in 19 patients performed between 1971 and 1982 were prospectively followed, using a computerized standard orthopaedic arthritis record. These cases represent an inclusive and unselected, consecutive series. The mean follow-up period from time of infection was 4.8 years (range, 1.2-11.7 years). Infection was diagnosed by positive bacteriologic culture. Ten hips grew a staphylococcal species, 5 a single gram-negative organism, 1 a Streptococcus, and 5 multiple organisms. At final follow-up evaluation, only three hips (14%) had the previously infected prosthesis still in situ, and these had no evidence of ongoing deep infection. Five additional hips (24%) were successfully salvaged after one- or two-stage prosthetic exchange. Two hips (10%) have an infected prosthesis in situ. Eleven hips (52%) had resection arthroplasty, three after attempts at prosthetic reinsertion. Therefore, at final follow-up evaluation, only 8 of the 21 hips (38%) have an apparently infection-free salvaged or reinserted prosthesis in place. Good prognostic factors for prosthetic salvage/successful reinsertion include Staphylococcus epidermidis infection and a traumatic etiology necessitating later hip arthroplasty. Poor prognostic factors include infection with Staphylococcus aureus or multiple organisms and a preoperative diagnosis of avascular necrosis.
TI  - A survey of aerobic bacteria and fungi in the feces of healthy psittacine birds.
AB  - Fecal samples from 61 clinically healthy psittacine birds of a wide variety of species were cultured for bacteria and fungi. The most common bacterial isolates were gram-positive bacilli, which were recovered from 60 of the 61 birds. These organisms included Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, and Streptomyces. Gram-positive cocci, cultured from the feces of 21 of the birds, included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., Aerococcus spp., and Micrococcus spp. Only 6 of the 61 psittaciformes yielded gram-negative bacteria, with Escherichia coli being the most frequent isolate. Gram-negative bacilli were recovered from 4 of the 31 privately owned birds and 2 of the 30 petshop birds sampled. In addition to the bacteria, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus laurentii, and Aspergillus sp. were isolated from 13 fecal cultures. Candida albicans was isolated exclusively from 5 petshop birds. The number of birds yielding Corynebacterium and gram-negative bacteria increased with age, whereas the number of birds yielding lactobacilli and yeasts decreased with age. The organisms isolated and their significance as potential pathogens in psittacine birds are discussed.
TI  - Chorioamnionitis: a study of organisms isolated in perinatal autopsies.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of postmortem cultures in perinatal autopsies; in particular, those cases where there is gross or histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis. Lung, liver, blood, and placental cultures were obtained from 159 neonatal autopsies with histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis at Magee-Women's Hospital between January 1980 and July 1985. The criterion for chorioamnionitis was a polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrate in the placental membranes. The neonates studied were 63 percent white and 36 percent black; the male to female ratio was 83 to 76. Intrauterine fetal death occurred in 43 percent of the cases. The mean gestational age was 24 weeks. Premature labor occurred in 64 percent of the cases, and 70 percent of the cases presented with premature rupture of fetal membranes. Congenital pneumonia (defined by the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the alveolar spaces) was present in 45 percent of cases. The lung was the most frequent site cultured; the four most frequently isolated organisms were: Staphylococcus epidermidis--18 percent; Beta Streptococcus Group B--13 percent; E. coli--nine percent; Ureaplasma urealyticum--nine percent. Negative cultures from multiple sites occurred in seven percent of cases. The results of this investigation indicate that multi-organ cultures help in defining the role of a particular bacteria as a pathogen, and that Staphylococcus epidermidis may be a true fetal pathogen under certain conditions. It is recommended that cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis not be done on fetal tissues.
TI  - Microbiology of adult cellulitis.
AB  - Needle aspiration of cellulitis sites is commonly advocated to assist in the identification of causative organisms. Twenty-five nondiabetic, adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of cellulitis had site aspirations and blood cultures obtained before antibiotic therapy was initiated. Site cultures were positive in 6 of 25 patients. Blood cultures were positive in 4 of 25 patients. All organisms except one (Enterobacter agglomerans) were staphylococci or streptococci. The gram-negative bacilli were not believed to be a pathogen based on the patient's prompt response to nafcillin. In adult patients who do not have complications, the use of needle aspiration was not supported. Empiric treatment of cellulitis aimed at gram-positive cocci appears to be sufficient.
TI  - Management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.
TI  - The nature of ulcerative keratitis in Kuwait (clinical and microbiological study).
AB  - A retrospective clinico-microbiological study of 83 patients with corneal ulcers  due to bacterial infection was performed. Positive cultures of corneal ulcer samples were obtained from 57% of all patients. A high incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from ulcer patients; Pseudomonas, Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumonia were the next most frequent pathogens. Of some help in identifying the causative organism were the locations of the ulcers, the presence or absence of hypopyon and the frequency of perforation. Gentamycin, cephaloridine and polymyxin were found to be the most effective therapies. Gram stains of ulcer samples were positive for organisms in only 11% of patients and accordingly were not considered useful in determining the appropriate initial therapy of ulcers. It was concluded that treatment should be started with a broad combination of antibiotics while awaiting the culture results.
TI  - Antibiotic spectrum of isolated germs in the vaginal smear of Nigerian women.
AB  - The bacteriological research of 534 vaginal smears of pregnant women and patients of the gynaecological ward in Abeokuta showed in 21.6% beta-hem. Streptococcus group D, in 10.9% Staphylococcus epidermidis, in 5.3% Escherichia coli, in 3.6% Staphylococcus aureus, in 1.3% beta-hem. Streptococcus group B and in 7.8% yeasts. 48% of all smears remained sterile. The antibiotics with the least effect were Tetracyclines and Penicillines. Trimethoprim and Sulfonamid, Ticarcillin and Netilmycin were able to prevent the bacterial growth by at least 89%. Isolated germs of private patients showed higher resistance against Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol than those of non-private patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - The bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  - The origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. To overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol NH3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora was ureolytic. After their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of Streptococcus salivarius, one Streptococcus bovis, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and three Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. The mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. However, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. Urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected Strep. salivarius, and Staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol NH3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. Thus urea metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to Strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from Staph. epidermidis. The presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  - Twenty-six adults with acute bacterial meningitis were enrolled in an open randomized comparative study. The organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. 13 patients (group A) were treated once daily with intravenous ceftriaxone (Rocephin). The 13 patients in group B received ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in 4 doses/day. The mean duration of therapy in groups A and B was 9.9 and 12.3 days, respectively. This difference in the duration of therapy was statistically significant. All patients from group A showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. In group B only 12 patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured; 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the therapy because CSF culture remained positive after 48 h of therapy. Ceftriaxone was well tolerated in all patients; ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol were associated with diarrhea and skin rash in 6 patients.
TI  - Open study of teicoplanin in gram-positive infections.
AB  - Eighteen patients with documented Gram-positive infections which included osteomyelitis, prosthetic infections, endocarditis, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infections were treated with teicoplanin. The organisms involved included Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates of which six were methicillin-resistant-MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (two), Streptococcus faecalis (one) and Streptococcus milleri (one). Clinical success occurred in all seven patients with skin and soft tissue Streptococcus milleri (one). Clinical success occurred in all seven patients with skin and soft tissue infections (with bacterial persistence in three out of the seven), in three patients with bacteraemia endocarditis, and in one of the three patients with chronic osteomyelitis. In four patients with prosthetic bone and joint infections, clinical improvement followed removal of prostheses. Adverse effects occurred in two patients and these included one patient with a rise in serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin and one patient with a rise in blood urea, both of which returned to within normal limits on discontinuing the drug. The study showed that teicoplanin is a safe and effective antistaphylococcal agent.
TI  - Use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a recently introduced glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used, in combination with other antibiotics, to treat 31 episodes of septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms. Teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many Gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. A single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. Of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with Hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. One death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment following febrile reaction. Eleven episodes were cured. Six episodes of Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. The remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including Streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Therapeutic update on glycopeptide and lipopeptide antibiotics.
AB  - Glycopeptide antibiotics in the form of vancomycin have been available for almost 30 years. In the past, vancomycin usually was reserved as an alternative agent to treat staphylococcal and streptococcal infection in patients with a penicillin allergy or hemodialysis shunt infection. With the increasing frequency of both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, now it is often used as a first-line agent. Over a 10-year period, vancomycin sales have increased by almost $1 hundred million. Several new glycopeptide and lipopeptide antibiotics are in various stages of evaluation. While vancomycin resistance to date is a rare phenomenon, these drugs represent a potentially more potent and safer antibiotic alternative to vancomycin. Teicoplanin and daptomycin are two of these investigational agents.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). II. Background of patients].
AB  - We have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes, age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. As for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. By contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. There were no noticeable changes according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. Thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. In 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were Gram-positive organisms. When species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of E. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983, and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. The isolation rate of Gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. Escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. These results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. In other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies evoked by the free oligopeptide (Gly)5 reacting specifically with peptidoglycan from staphylococci.
AB  - Murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with the Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PG) epitope (Gly)5 were obtained using the synthetic oligopeptide (Gly)5 in its free form as immunogen. The selected monoclonal antibodies were of the IgM kappa isotype and reacted specifically with PG from S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but gave no reaction with PG from Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Affinity chromatography showed that the antibodies were reactive with the N-terminus of the (Gly)5 peptide. These monoclonal antibodies can be used for the detection of staphylococcal PG in solution.
TI  - In-vitro activity of roxithromycin against respiratory and skin pathogens.
AB  - The activity of roxithromycin was determined by a microdilution method, in comparison with erythromycin, spiramycin and josamycin. Roxithromycin and erythromycin showed very similar MICs against staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. In most cases, spiramycin and josamycin appeared similarly or more active. The activity of roxithromycin against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydia psittaci and, to some extent, against Pasteurella spp. was also assessed, by suitable in-vitro methods. Roxithromycin has a promising potential for treating selected skin and respiratory infections.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the oral cephalosporin BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium difficile. BMY-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BMY-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100, including bactericidal activity, against Staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Clinical observation of acute cervical lymphadenitis in children].
AB  
TI  - Comparison of techniques for the selection of bacteria-free sperm preparations.
AB  - The authors compared the three most commonly used sperm preparation techniques--swim-up, fall-down, and Percoll gradient--for their ability to recover highly motile sperm and minimize bacterial contamination. Eleven human semen samples collected by masturbation were used and run in parallel with the three methods. A semiquantitative bacterial analysis was performed in all samples and results expressed in colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). The Percoll gradient technique resulted in an average sperm concentration of 5.81 +/- 4.4 X 10(6) ml, and the average bacterial concentration dropped from 8.66 +/- 12.96 X 10(3) CFU/ml in semen to 0.01 +/- 0.03 X 10(3) CFU/ml. The bacterial count was not significantly different when the raw semen was compared with the swim-up or the fall-down preparations. The authors conclude that the Percoll gradient method yields an adequate sperm concentration, with high motility and improved morphology, while eliminating bacterial contamination.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and killing rate of serum against gram-positive cocci in volunteers receiving imipenem, oxacillin, vancomycin or ampicillin plus gentamicin.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity and rate of killing of serum was studied in two groups of ten volunteers receiving imipenem 500 mg, oxacillin 3 g and vancomycin 1 g given iv (Group 1) or imipenem 500 mg, vancomycin 1 g, and ampicillin 3 g plus gentamicin 80 mg iv (Group 2). Serum samples collected 30 min, 1 h and 6 h after the start of a 15 min infusion were tested against Staphylococcus aureus susceptible (five strains) or resistant (five strains) to oxacillin, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to (five strains) or resistant (five strains) to oxacillin (Group 1), and against Streptococcus faecalis (four strains), Streptococcus spp. (six strains). All strains of streptococci had been isolated from patients with endocarditis. Imipenem produced the highest bactericidal titres against susceptible staphylococci whereas vancomycin produced the highest titres against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Against "non faecalis" streptococci, imipenem was equivalent to ampicillin plus gentamicin, whereas ampicillin plus gentamicin was the most active regimen against Str. faecalis. The study of the rate of killing of serum showed that imipenem was able to kill initially 1.5 log cfu/ml of Str. faecalis but this was followed by regrowth. A similar regrowth was observed with oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Killing curves in broth were studied with imipenem at two temperatures (30 and 37 degrees C) and two initial inocula (10(5) and 10(6) cfu/ml) for 48 h of incubation against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci; regrowth occurred more rapidly with a high initial inoculum and low temperature of incubation despite a rapid initial killing. Gentamicin was found significantly to increase the rate of killing of imipenem against Str. faecalis in killing curves in broth. In conclusion, imipenem showed excellent activity, as assessed by the measure of the bactericidal titres and rate of killing in serum, against the studied strains with the exception of oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Str. faecalis.
TI  - The use of a new glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used to treat twelve patients with bacterial endocarditis due to Gram-positive organisms. Teicoplanin has activity against Gram-positive bacteria similar to vancomycin but therapeutic levels are maintained by a single daily dose, given as an intravenous bolus. Of six patients with native valve infections, two cases, due to viridans streptococci, were successfully treated with teicoplanin alone and two others, caused by Streptococcus faecalis, were cured by combinations including teicoplanin. One of these patients sustained high tone hearing loss during treatment. The remaining two patients were drug addicts with endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus which recurred despite repeated multiple therapy. Of six prosthetic valve infections, antibiotic combinations including teicoplanin cured three cases, caused by streptococci. Infection persisted or treatment was curtailed in three cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis. In this small open study, teicoplanin appeared as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of endocarditis but had the considerable advantage of ease of administration.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of LY146032 and eight other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria isolated from children.
AB  - LY146032, a cyclic peptide antibiotic active against many Gram-positive bacteria, was compared to methicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin, cefuroxime and gentamicin against methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staph. epidermidis. LY146032 was uniformly active against clinical isolates of staphylococci, inhibiting 90% of strains of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l. Vancomycin was slightly less active than LY146032 against Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis, inhibiting 90% of strains at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/l, respectively. All other antibiotics tested were less active than LY146032 or vancomycin against staphylococci. LY146032 was compared to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and chloramphenicol against strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, group D streptococcus (enterococcus) and Listeria monocytogenes and was found to inhibit 90% of the strains at concentrations of 0.25, 1.0, 32.0 and 16.0 mg/l respectively. The combination of LY146032 and chloramphenicol was antagonistic in vitro for one strain each of Staph. aureus and group D streptococcus and showed indifference against other strains of Staph. aureus(2), Staph. epidermidis(2), group D streptococcus(1) and L. monocytogenes(2). LY146032 in combination with gentamicin showed indifference against the same bacteria. On the basis of its in-vitro activity, LY146032 appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of serious community- and hospital-acquired staphylococcal infections.
TI  - In-vitro susceptibility of gram-positive cocci to LY146032 teicoplanin, sodium fusidate, vancomycin, and rifampicin.
AB  - LY146032, a new antimicrobial agent with activity against Gram-positive cocci, was tested against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staph. epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus, and Streptococcus faecalis. MIC90s in cation-supplemented Mueller Hinton broth by the microdilution broth method were less than 1.0 mg/l for all organisms tested. Increasing or decreasing the inoculum size did not appreciably effect the MIC50 or MIC90 for any organism group nor did decreasing the incubation temperature. The addition of sodium chloride to the test system did not appreciably effect the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus to LY146032. All organisms were 4 to 32 times more susceptible to LY146032 than to vancomycin. The Staph. aureus had LY146032 susceptibility patterns which were similar to those of teicoplanin and sodium fusidate. LY146032 was 4-16 times more active than teicoplanin against Staph. saprophyticus and Staph. epidermidis while teicoplanin was 8-16 times more active than LY146032 against Str. faecalis.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa of 102 patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; Candida albicans: 29.4%; Staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; Staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; Haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; Streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; Pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; Aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. Other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. In the majority of specimens with P. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. These strains were identical in colony appearance, O-serotype and pyocin-type. Quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for P. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for P. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for S. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for S. epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for C. albicans in the majority of specimens. Significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. Maximum persistence was observed for P. aeruginosa. P. maltophilia and A. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates, which were lower than those for P. aeruginosa but above those for S. aureus and H. influenzae. S. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than S. aureus. C. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified, showed a very low persistence rate. The microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of P. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (Pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of P. maltophilia and C. albicans). This underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - Contamination rates of 3-in-1 total parenteral nutrition in a clinical setting.
AB  
TI  - Neonatal septicemia in Stockholm.
AB  - In a prospective study to determine the incidence and etiology of neonatal septicemia at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, all cases of neonatal septicemia in infants born at the hospital from 1981 to 1985 were reviewed. There were 4.0 cases of neonatal septicemia per 1,000 live births during the study period. During the five year period the incidence of septicemia tended to increase, mainly due to the increasing incidence of septicemia in infants with a birth weight below 1,500 grams. The single most common causative organism was group B streptococci with an incidence of 1.4 per 1,000 live births, Staphylococcus aureus accounting for 1.1 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis for 0.7 cases, and gram-negative rods for only 0.4 cases per 1,000 live births. In a retrospective study of the incidence of neonatal septicemia in a non-selected patient population, all cases in the Stockholm area in 1983 were reviewed. In that year there were 17,586 live births in the area and the incidence of neonatal septicemia was 2.6 per 1,000 live births. Group B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative rods were equally common as causative agents.
TI  - In vitro correlation of platelet aggregation with occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. The potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. The aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. None of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. Addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. These data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. The rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. These observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.
TI  - [Treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic children by ceftazidime combined with netilmicin. Results of a multicenter study apropos of 88 cases].
AB  - Infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. In a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non Hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). Median age was 7 years (2 months-16 years). In patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was added after 48 hours. The effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. The first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. Bacteria were isolated in 39 children: Escherichia coli: 9, Staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, Staphylococcus aureus: 8, Streptococcus: 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, Haemophilus: 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, Proteus: 1, Serratia: 1, Flavobacterium: 1. In these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. All blood culture were negative after the first combination. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). There were no death, no superinfection. Tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. We conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with neoplastic disease.
AB  - This study reviewed 431 episodes of septicemia occurring in 356 patients with cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center during 1982. The most frequent organisms causing 273 episodes in 239 non-neutropenic patients were Escherichia coli (20 percent), Staphylococcus aureus (13 percent), polymicrobic (12 percent), Pseudomonas species (8 percent), Klebsiella species (7 percent), Candida species (7 percent), Bacteroides species (6 percent), Enterobacter species (4 percent), and Clostridium species (4 percent). The overall mortality was 31 percent (21 percent with adequate therapy; 50 percent with inadequate therapy). The most frequent organisms causing 158 episodes in 117 neutropenic patients were polymicrobic (21 percent), E. coli (16 percent), Klebsiella species (15 percent), Pseudomonas species (8 percent), Candida species (6 percent), S. aureus (6 percent), Streptococcus faecalis (5 percent), S. epidermidis (4 percent), and Corynebacterium CDC-JK (3 percent). The overall mortality was 52 percent (36 percent with adequate therapy; 88 percent with inadequate therapy). Since a review a decade ago, the spectrum of organisms changed in that the gram-positive organisms, S. faecalis, S. epidermidis, and C. CDC-JK, emerged as important pathogens. Neutropenic patients had a high incidence (42 percent) of septicemia due to multiple organisms, occurring concurrently or sequentially. The overall mortality of these patients was exceptionally high (80 percent). In contrast, the overall mortality of neutropenic patients with single-organism septicemia was comparable to that of non-neutropenic patients with single-organism septicemia (37 percent versus 29 percent).
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - Serious infectious complications of open-heart surgery.
AB  - Serious infectious complications of open-heart surgery in 521 adults who underwent 534 open-heart procedures are reviewed. Bacteremia complicated seven (1.3%) of the procedures, carditis six (1.1%) and deep sternal wound infections nine (1.7%). The overall rate of these infections was 4.1% with an associated death rate of 11.7% (2 of 17). With respect to the risk of this complication, no differences were noted in the age of the patients, duration of surgery or perioperative prophylaxis with cephalothin or cloxacillin. The chance of carditis developing was significantly related (p less than 0.001) to a valve replacement procedure and the risk of a deep sternal wound infection (p less than 0.01) to a procedure classed as "other". Staphylococci remained the most commonly isolated pathogens with an almost equal frequency of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Gram-negative aerobes and Streptococcus faecalis were found to be other important pathogens in this clinical setting.
TI  - Human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  - Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hCG), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the COOH-terminal peptide of hCG beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hCG beta, demonstrated expression of hCG-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. Seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as Streptococcus faecalis (three strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (single strains). The other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (CWD) variants, one identified as Streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. The other was a Gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a Gram-positive Corynebacterium identified as a 'C. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hCG-like factor only during its phase as Gram-negative diphtheroid. Electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hCG-like material including the two CWD variants. Collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hCG-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hCG molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibodies to various bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans in human and rabbit sera.
AB  - Sera from patients with verified systemic staphylococcal infection contained antibodies reactive with peptidoglycan (PG) from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. The presence of anti-PG cross-reactive antibodies was verified in patient sera by inhibition studies with the various bacterial PGs. Antibodies to nonstaphylococcal PGs were also elevated in sera from rabbits immunized with S. aureus PG. Antibodies to S. aureus PG were removed with the synthetic peptide analogs of S. aureus PG, the L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, L-Lys-D-Ala, and (Gly)5 determinants, as well as with an S. aureus PG peptide fragment containing the determinants D-Ala-D-Ala and L-Lys-D-Ala. Isolated antibodies to the PG peptides, both synthetic and native, were reactive with S. aureus and S. epidermidis PGs. The antibodies to the D-Ala-D-Ala and the L-Lys-D-Ala determinants were also reactive with S. pyogenes PG, but not with PGs from M. lysodeikticus, B. subtilis, and E. coli.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of Vancocin and generic vancomycin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of generic vancomycin was compared with that  of Vancocin (vancomycin hydrochloride; Eli Lilly & Co.) using macrotube dilution testing and subculture. There were no significant differences in MICs or MBCs of the two drugs when tested against a variety of recently isolated hospital pathogens.
TI  - Effect of minimal amounts of thymidine on activity of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 99 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis was tested on media known to be low in thymidine content, as determined by screening with Streptococcus faecalis. Eighty-one percent of the isolates were susceptible by agar dilution. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was bactericidal against two strains of S. epidermidis when thymidine phosphorylase was added to the medium, indicating utilization of minimal amounts of thymidine that were undetected by screening. Because bacteria vary in their utilization of thymidine and body tissues vary in thymidine content, in vitro susceptibility tests may not correlate with in vivo bactericidal activity.
TI  - Phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by middle ear macrophages.
AB  - Because macrophage dysfunction has been suggested as one of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for otitis media with effusion, we have examined macrophage-bacterial interactions using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-induced middle ear macrophages from chinchillas. Our data indicate that macrophages recruited to the middle ear were functional phagocytes capable of discriminate phagocytosis and intracellular killing of eight species of bacteria associated with otitis media, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. Streptococcus pneumoniae types 14 and 19F, which are associated with the highest relapse frequency in cases of acute otitis media, were the most resistant to phagocytosis. The two organisms most often involved in chronic otitis media (Staphylococcus epidermidis and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae), however, were among the most readily phagocytized isolates. The relative importance of macrophage function in defense of the middle ear, therefore, may be dependent on the causative agent.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. MICs of LY146032 were lowest for Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus the MICs were 1 mg/l, for Enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and for Enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. The activity of LY146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. Time-kill studies showed LY146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin), a new peptolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032, a new peptolide antibiotic, was compared with  those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, imipenem, amoxicillin and erythromycin. LY146032 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-resistant isolates at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. MIC90s for the beta-hemolytic streptococci varied from 0.25 microgram/ml for group B streptococci to 4 micrograms/ml for some group C and F streptococci. MICs for Streptococcus faecalis were in the range of 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 4 micrograms/ml, compared to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 1 microgram/ml for teicoplanin. For some viridans streptococci the MICs were 4 micrograms/ml, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Corynebacterium JK species were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, similar to vancomycin, and Listeria monocytogenes by 4 micrograms/ml. Neisseria species, Haemophilus species and enteric species were not inhibited. Most MBCs were within two-fold of the respective MICs. After 14 days passage in sub-inhibitory concentrations of LY146032, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis showed minimal increase in MICs. The activity of LY146032 was increased by adding Ca2+ and was reduced in an anaerobic environment. Overall, LY146032 is an extremely interesting new agent that inhibits gram-positive species.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of teicoplanin for  serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Nineteen patients hospitalized for serious gram-positive infections were treated  with teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic. A variety of infections were treated, including endocarditis, septic thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, pyogenic arthritis, and soft tissue infection. Of 13 infections that could be evaluated in 12 patients, there were 8 clinical cures, 2 improvements, 1 recurrence, and 2 failures. Of the eight patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, seven were clinically cured or improved with teicoplanin therapy. Of the nine patients in whom the bacteriological response to treatment could be fully evaluated, six were cured; there was recurrence of infection in one, and treatment failed in two patients. In vitro testing showed the 13 bacterial isolates (9 S. aureus, 3 S. epidermidis, and 1 group B streptococcus) to be uniformly susceptible to teicoplanin, with MICs ranging from 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. Every isolate was more susceptible in vitro to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. Three of the staphylococcal isolates were resistant to methicillin. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that after an initial drug-accumulation period, a single daily dose adequately maintained the teicoplanin concentrations in serum within therapeutic ranges. Teicoplanin also penetrated well into synovial fluid. The drug was well tolerated by either intravenous or intramuscular administration. The most significant adverse reaction was an urticarial rash which required discontinuation of therapy in one patient; a second patient experienced a modest decrease in high-frequency auditory threshold. Asymptomatic eosinophilia and mild elevation of serum transaminases were noted as well. The results of this study suggest that teicoplanin is a safe and effective new agent for treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - A microbiological study of acute otitis media in Bloemfontein.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was done on 36 patients (57 ears) with acute otitis media. Positive cultures were obtained in 65% of cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated organism (25% of ears). There was a high incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (14% of ears); these organisms are considered to be true pathogens. Haemophilus influenzae seemed to be less common than in other series and in all our cases were non-producers of beta-lactamase. Penicillin and amoxycillin appeared to be equally effective and there seemed to be little difference between responses to cefaclor, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole.
TI  - Pyogenic infection and rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - Ten episodes of severe pyogenic infection occurring in nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis are reported. There was a wide range of presenting features including pyoarthrosis in 7 episodes. Three cases presented with meningitis, bacterial endocarditis and probable multiple abscesses respectively. Infection was caused by Staphylococcus aureus in 7 episodes and by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus in each of one episode. Three infective episodes were fatal. Pyogenic, especially staphylococcal, infection should be considered in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with unexplained illness with or without sudden deterioration in joint symptoms. It is important to recognize and treat infection rapidly.
TI  - Activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  - Cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group A type of Schleifer and Kandler's classification, with one exception (Arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. The complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group B type peptidoglycan, except those of Corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group A type peptidoglycan. Preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. A water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (SEPS), which was prepared from Staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. A peptidoglycan "monomer," SEPS-M, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of SEPS with endo-N-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. In conformity with this finding, neither synthetic N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) nor MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala activated the complement cascade. Among several lipophilic derivatives of MDP, 6-O-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala (BH48-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala) and 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDP (B30-MDP) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through the classical pathway, respectively. The finding that a D-isoasparagine analog of B30-MDP caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the activation of complement by B30-MDP is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.
TI  - [Microbial etiology of the MMA syndrome (mastitis-metritis-agalactia) in swine raised commercially].
AB  - A total of 147 uterine-cervical exudates and milk samples from 165 lobes of the mammary gland of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA) were studied microbiologically. It was found that greatest was the share of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus organisms taking part in the microbial etiology of the syndrome. Second ranked Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Corynebacterium pyogenes along with some aerobic sporulating bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Local immune responses in the ocular and oral secretory compartments of humans.
AB  
TI  - Microbiological perspectives of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide and trimethoprim against isolates of 24 gram-negative and 11 gram-positive species. The incidence of more than 10% of strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations above 32 mg/l was restricted to Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Occasionally, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains with MICs above 32 mg/l were identified. Co-trimoxazole in vitro activity was superior to the comparative drugs for the majority of species. Co-trimoxazole remains an active combination against major pathogens of infections of the upper and lower respiratory, urinary tract and enteric infections with a still low incidence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Corneal rim cultures.
AB  - We performed a retrospective analysis of 291 consecutive scleral rim cultures, taken at the time of corneal transplantation, from 1981 to 1986. There were 82 positive cultures (39%), and the most common pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis, with 24 positive cultures (30%). Ten of these (42%) were resistant to gentamycin. There were no cases of endophthalmitis or other infections in the immediate postoperative period. We also found 15 positive cultures of Streptococcus viridans. Of these, 13 (87%) were resistant to gentamycin but sensitive to most other antibiotics. Even though endophthalmitis is rare following penetrating keratoplasty, the emergence of resistant strains of Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus epidermidis suggests that eyebanks need to consider the addition of a second antibiotic to their MK medium.
TI  - Alpha-hemolytic streptococcal septicemia with severe complications during neutropenia in childhood cancer.
AB  - After introduction of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), a change toward an increase of infections by Staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic Streptococci has been noticed in the predominant etiology of infections during neutropenia. During a 27-month study period, 165 positive blood cultures were obtained from 64 neutropenic children. In 26 cases there was septicemia caused by Streptococci. Alpha-hemolytic Streptococci were isolated from blood culture in 25 cases. In 1 case septicemia was caused by beta-hemolytic Streptococcus of group G. In 10 patients, all with hematologic malignancies, septicemia attended with complications. We suggest that patients with hematologic malignancies are at risk of an unusually severe clinical course of streptococcal septicemia.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris against bacterial isolates from clinical specimens.
AB  - Chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris was more active compared with chlorhexidine against the following species of organisms: Acinetobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Providence species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis, when tested in isosensitest agar. The addition of 20% serum to the medium reduced its effectiveness mainly against Providence species, Proteus species, and Streptococcus faecalis. However, the potential for this solution as a bladder instillation or topical antiseptic should be considered because of its reduced side effects compared with chlorhexidine alone, and its increased general effectiveness against all isolates tested.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Teicoplanin for therapy of gram-positive infections in neutropenic patients.
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 20 febrile neutropenic patients as additional treatment for suspected Gram-positive infections after inadequate response to initial empiric ceftazidime monotherapy. Five patients with primary septicaemia, four with secondary septicaemia, 12 with localized infections and three with pyrexia of unknown origin were treated with teicoplanin (200 mg bolus intravenously, once daily after a 400 mg loading dose), whilst ceftazidime (2 g, 8-hourly, 30 min infusions) was continued. Four patients were unassessable (tuberculous, viral, protocol violation, and non-infectious pyrexial episode). Clinical cure for the combination was achieved in 11 or the 16 assessable cases (69%). Ten of the eleven (91%) bacteriologically confirmed infections were cured after addition of teicoplanin. Three strains of Staphylococcus aureus, four of Staphylococcus epidermidis (two methicillin resistant), and three strains of Streptococcus faecalis were isolated from successfully treated patients. One patient with Aerococcus and Enterobacter cloacae infection only improved after addition of erythromycin. One superinfection occurred with signs of interstitial pneumonitis in a patient following bone marrow transplantation. Neither ototoxicity nor nephrotoxicity occurred during treatment. A transient rise of liver transaminases was observed in four patients, but was attributable to teicoplanin in only one case. It is concluded that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent in neutropenic patients with infections due to Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - The influence of penicillin and quinaldofur on the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis in milk.
AB  - The influence of penicillin and quinaldofur on the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis in milk depends on aerobic conditions and the quality of milk.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in healthy young men.
AB  - The nasal cavity of 97 young healthy men (applicants for the pilot education in the Finnish Air Force) was examined. Bacterial culture demonstrated one or more species of aerobic bacteria in all 194 nasal cavities examined and anaerobic bacteria in 76.5%. In ten per cent of the cultures bacteria were detected after enrichment only. The most common aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (79%), diphtheroids (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (34%). Haemophilus influenzae was found in 5% and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 0.5%. Anaerobic culture yielded Propionibacterium acnes in 74.5% and Peptococcus magnus in 3.5%.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of A-56268 (TE-031), the 6-O-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. A-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3. The activity of A-56268 was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of H. influenzae. In mouse protection tests, when administered orally A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. After subcutaneous administration the potencies of A-56268 and erythromycin were not statistically different from each other. A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against Legionella infection in guinea pigs. The concentration of A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In mice, the peak levels in serum of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for A-56268 after oral administration. The serum half-life of A-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.
TI  - Naturally occurring IgA antibodies to ocular and oral microorganisms in tears saliva and colostrum: evidence for a common mucosal immune system and local immune response.
AB  - In this study, levels of naturally occurring secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies to bacterial isolates representative of the microflora of the human eye (Staphylococcus epidermidis and a Corynebacterium species) and the oral cavity (Streptococcus mutans serotypes c and d) were assessed in three different human external secretions. Tears and parotid saliva samples collected at the same time from 22 healthy subjects and colostrum from 11 healthy women (1-14 days post partum) were assessed for sIgA anti-bacterial antibody levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Significantly higher levels (P less than 0.001) of IgA antibodies to Staphylococcus epidermidis and the Corynebacterium sp. were found in tears than in parotid saliva. Furthermore, higher levels of sIgA antibodies to Streptococcus mutans serotype d occurred in parotid saliva than in tears of these subjects. Although levels of salivary sIgA antibodies to S. mutans serotype c were lower than those seen to serotype d, they were not significantly different from those in tears. However, absolute sIgA anti-serotype c antibodies per mg IgA were higher in saliva than in tears. When sIgA antibody levels to the four bacterial strains were assessed in colostrum, the proportion of sIgA antibodies per mg IgA were much lower than seen in tears or saliva. These results suggest that natural sIgA antibodies which occur in human external secretions are induced by antigen ingestion and stimulation of the common mucosal immune system. However, the local presence of antigen at a mucosal site induces greater clonal expression and results in higher levels of sIgA antibodies than at mucosal sites not exposed to local antigenic stimulation.
TI  - The bacteriology of dog bite wounds on initial presentation.
AB  - Four hundred twenty patients with open dog bite wounds on initial presentation to the emergency department had Gram stains, aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and antibiotic sensitivities of the bacterial isolates of each wound. Forty-eight percent of the wounds evidenced no bacterial growth. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolate (20.5%). Multiple bacteria were isolated in 15.5% of patients. Fifty percent of clinically infected wounds showed multiple pathogenic organisms, on both culture and Gram stain. The predominant pathogenic bacteria in clinically infected wounds were, in order, Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and beta-Streptococcus. Gram stains were useful in determining specific antibiotic therapy in only 6% of infected cases and in 2% of uninfected cases. Statistical differences appeared between initially clinically infected and uninfected dog bite wounds, in both the types of bacteria and frequency of occurrence. Clinical infections were treated effectively with cephradine in more than 95% of cases. Infected wounds growing multiple pathogenic bacteria and/or Gram stains that showed multiple bacterial types were covered by a cephalosporin or penicillinase-resistant penicillin. Six percent of isolates could require an aminoglycoside for treatment.
TI  - Inhibition of caries in hamsters treated with staphylococcin 1580.
AB  - Littermate hamsters were infected orally with cariogenic Streptococcus mutans NS-50S and maintained on a high-sucrose diet to induce dental caries. Individual groups of animals were treated by single daily instillation of staphylococcin 1580 (100 micrograms) in the cheek pouches. Other groups were treated similarly with bacitracin (60 or 120 U) or saline. After 35 days on the caries test regimen, animals treated with staphylococcin 1580 had 49 or 60% less caries than the saline controls in two separate trials. Hamsters treated with 60 U of bacitracin had 40% less caries, while animals receiving 120 U of bacitracin had 58% less caries. Significant reductions in the oral and fecal levels of S. mutans NS-50S were also observed in the treated animals. In contrast to earlier, inconclusive experiments in which these agents were placed directly into the oral cavity, the inhibition of caries in this study is attributed to prolongation of the oral retention of these agents, with increased opportunity to interact with cariogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteremia with gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures.
AB  - The authors have reviewed 40 prospective studies of bacteremia with gastrointestinal procedures. Endoscopic procedures with a low mean frequency of bacteremia were esophagogastroduodenoscopy (4.2%), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (5.6%), colonoscopy (2.2%), and sigmoidoscopy (4.9%). A higher mean frequency of bacteremia was encountered with esophageal dilation (45%) and variceal sclerotherapy (31%), although the number of patients studied was small. Potentially pathogenic organisms, such as Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis have been isolated. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis are reviewed. Less cumbersome regimens encourage compliance and are preferred.
TI  - The value of needle aspiration in the management of cellulitis.
AB  - Needle aspirations from 103 young, healthy patients (mean age 22 years) with cellulitis were prospectively analyzed to determine the percentage yield and causative organisms. A standard technique of needle aspiration was performed using a 22-gauge needle, a 10-cc syringe, and 1 cc of sterile water. Aspirations were performed at the leading edge and midpoint of the cellulitis (halfway between the leading edge and the center of the cellulitis). Fifteen of the 103 patients (14.5 percent) had positive aspirates. Nine of the 103 aspirates were positive at the leading edge (8.7 percent) and 6 of 70 were positive at the midpoint (8.6 percent), giving a total aspiration positivity of 8.7 percent (15/173). The organisms recovered were Staphylococcus aureus (53 percent). Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 percent), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (13 percent) and Streptococcus pyogenes (7 percent). The low-percentage yield and predictable organisms recovered speak against needle aspiration being a necessary procedure in a young, healthy population. Similarly, the site of aspiration does not increase yield. Empiric treatment with antibiotics aimed at staphylococcal and streptococcal organisms is appropriate.
TI  - Acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Bacteriology and clinical implications.
AB  - We report the results of eye culture specimens, obtained from patients under 20 years of age, submitted to the Bacteriology Department of our institution from January 1 through April 30, 1983. A total of 72 specimens were positive for one or more strains of bacteria. The most commonly isolated bacteria was Hemophilus influenzae (34 strains, 42%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (11 strains, 13.75%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9 strains, 11.25%). Mean age of patients with H. influenzae (excluding a 20-year-old patient) was 15 months with standard deviation of 13 months. Chloramphenicol and tetracycline showed excellent in vitro activity against bacteria of all age groups. Tetracycline may prove to be the drug of choice for the treatment of acute conjunctivitis if comparative clinical data support its in vitro superiority.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Method for flow cytometric detection of Listeria monocytogenes in milk.
AB  - This report describes a method for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in raw milk by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescently labeled bacterial populations. The use of immunofluorescence in combination with measures of DNA content by propidium iodide labeling and size by light scattering enabled specific identification of L. monocytogenes from Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus hyicus. Additional specific resolution of L. monocytogenes populations was achieved through selective enrichment of raw milk in Listeria enrichment broth. These procedures should permit the rapid screening of milk and other food samples for L. monocytogenes and eliminate many of the short-comings associated with conventional fluorescent-antibody procedures.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics and bactericidal activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin.
AB  - Teicoplanin (0.2 g) or vancomycin (1 g) were infused over 3 and 50 min respectively to six male volunteers in a cross-over study. Each drug was administered twice at a 14 h interval. The pharmacokinetics of both drugs were accurately described using a two-compartment model. Vancomycin had a shorter half-life (5.8 +/- 1.8 h) compared to teicoplainin (33.2 +/- 5.1 h; P less than 0.001). One hour serum was tested for serum bactericidal activity against ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus (median serum bactericidal activity 1:16 for teicoplanin; 1:32 for vancomycin), Staph. epidermidis (1:32 for teicoplanin and for vancomycin) and Streptococcus faecalis (1:2 for both drugs). Serum killing rate studies showed a slower rate of killing of Staph. aureus with teicoplanin (less than 1 log10 cfu/ml over 6 h) than with vancomycin (4 log10 cfu/ml over 6 h).
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies of cefotiam in neonates and premature infants].
AB  - The effect of cefotiam (CTM) on neonates and premature infants was examined in basic and clinical studies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CTM against 190 clinically isolated strains kept by this department were investigated. This drug was found to have a strong antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, although some strains were resistant. The CTM was given to 0-3, 4-7, and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and we studied changes in serum CTM levels over time. Mean serum CTM levels were 62.3 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 16.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after the injection, with the half-life of 3.6 hours, for the 0-3 day-old premature infants. They were 38.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 10.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 2.9 hours, for the 0-3 day-old neonates. Those levels were 22.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.9 hours, for the 4-7 day-old neonates, and 51.8 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 1.0 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.1 hours, for the greater than or equal to 8 day-old neonates. The CTM was given to 0-3 and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and changes in serum CTM levels after the infusion were followed. The 0-3 day-old premature infant (there was only one subject) had a peak serum CTM level of 21.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after the start of the infusion (that is, at the time of its completion), with the level decreased to 8.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours and the half-life was 5.4 hours. The mean peak serum CTM level in 0-3 day-old neonates were 36.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, which decreased to a mean of 7.0 micrograms/ml at 7 hours; the half-life was 2.3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine 0.5% on the hand bacterial flora.
AB  - The effects of cleaning the dorsal hand with chlorhexidine 0.5% in spirit was evaluated by bacteriological study in 45 adult patients. In the absence of cleaning it was found that the prevalent microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans and Enterobacteriaceae. Cleaning the hand with chlorhexidine 0.5% eliminated all bacteria except S. epidermidis and S. aureus. In both instances, the culture results showed that the microorganisms were present in very low growth density.
TI  - Cefoperazone for empiric therapy in patients with impaired renal function.
AB  - Thirty-five patients with serious infections and impaired renal function were treated empirically with 2 to 8 g of cefoperazone per day. Infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. The average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. Infections were caused by Enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, Streptococcus faecalis in five, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, Staphylococcus aureus in four, Hemophilus influenzae in three, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium sordelli in one each. Overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. Hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin K for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. Prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin K, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. In anicteric patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. In jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. Serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive mastogenic bacteria in normal, simulated bulk tank, and mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank.
AB  - Growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus uberis was studied in normal milk, simulated bulk tank milk, and aseptic mastitic milk held at simulated fluctuating temperatures of farm bulk tank for 48 h. With the exception of S. bovis, growth rates of the other five bacteria were similar in both normal and simulated bulk tank milk. Mastitic milk inhibited growth of all bacteria studied. A 24-h adjustment period occurred before most of the bacteria started growing. The mastitis level in a dairy herd may be monitored by cultures of bulk tank milk samples and by calculations as discussed in this study.
TI  - Sterility of preloaded insulin syringes.

TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dilute povidone-iodine solutions used for ocular surface disinfection in dogs.
AB  - Bacterial cultures of specimens from healthy canine eyelids and ocular surfaces were found to demonstrate bacterial growth in 69.7% (53/76) of the eyes sampled. Organisms most commonly isolated included: Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus sp, S epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. Evaluation of dilute povidone-iodine solutions for effectiveness as ocular surface disinfectants was conducted. Bacterial growth initially detected in 32 of 46 eyes was not detected after disinfection with a 2-minute scrub and 2-minute soaking procedure, using 1:2, 1:10, or 1:50 dilutions of a povidone-iodine solution that contained 1% available iodine. The eyelid and ocular surfaces of 16 eyes were disinfected with 1:100 povidone-iodine solution. Bacterial growth initially present in 10 of 16 eyes was present in 1 eye after disinfection and consisted of a single colony of E coli. After eyes were disinfected with 1:10, 1:50, or 1:100 povidone-iodine solutions, there was no evidence of corneal epithelial edema or sloughing. In 15 eyes subjected to disinfection with the 1:2 dilution, one instance of epithelial corneal edema was noticed. A 1:50 dilution of povidone-iodine is recommended as an ocular surface disinfectant for use in presurgical situations.
TI  - Risk factors for wound infections after genitourinary reconstructive surgery.
AB  - In January through August 1983, eight children developed wound infections after they underwent genitourinary reconstructive surgery at one hospital. Cultures of purulent drainage yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two cases, Streptococcus faecalis in one case, both S. faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one case, and S. faecalis and other Gram-negative rods in four cases. A study in which uninfected children who had had genitourinary reconstructive surgery were used as controls revealed that all cases and controls had received cephalosporin prophylaxis. Antibiograms revealed that all organisms were resistant to the cephalosporin antibiotics tested. Risk of infection was associated with shaving (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test) and exposure to one nurse (nurse X) (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test) and one surgeon (surgeon X) (p = 0.007, Fisher's exact test). Nurse X was the private scrub nurse for surgeon X; she was present only at operations surgeon X performed (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test) and had no reported or observed practices different from those of other surgical nurses. However, surgeon X had two practices that were notably different from those of other surgeons: 1) he used quaternary ammonium compounds, acetone/alcohol, and 1 per cent hexachlorophene for preoperative skin preparation; and 2) he prepared the operative site himself. In addition, he was observed to prepare the operative site by beginning centrally, moving peripherally, and returning to the central area with the same sponge. These findings suggested that the shaving of the operative site and the use of certain agents and/or different preparatory techniques may have contributed to increased risk of wound infections. These wound infections were caused by organisms resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic(s) used.
TI  - Polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  - A protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. At least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. Bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. The most common organisms included Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B Streptococcus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.
TI  - Effects of carbon dioxide upon the in vitro activity of erythromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae was examined by agar dilution and agar diffusion methods. The plates were incubated in air alone or in 8% CO2 and air. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) measured in air alone were lower for most of the isolates, compared to those found in 8% CO2. The greatest differences in MIC values were found for H. influenzae; the MIC 50% was 0.5 mg/l in air and 4 mg/l in 8% CO2. Sensitivity testing by the agar diffusion method (ICS) showed considerable differences between results obtained in air and in 8% CO2; the inhibition zones were generally smaller in CO2. The most marked reduction in zone sizes after incubation in 8% CO2 was seen with the H. influenzae isolates; 15 out of 43 isolates moved from the "sensitive" to "moderately sensitive" group. Sensitivity determination of aerobic bacteria for erythromycin should be performed in air alone in the routine laboratory.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - [Treatment of peritonitis due to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis using  a single daily intraperitoneal dose of 1g cefotiam].
AB  - Peritonitis remains the main complication of CAPD. This study demonstrates that most cases can be successfully treated with cefotiam. In 17 patients under CAPD, 33 cases of bacterial peritonitis were observed, with clinical manifestations in 28. The mean cell count in peritoneal dialysis fluid was 2 820/mm3, with 2 200/mm3 polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Causative pathogens were Staphylococcus in 18 cases, Streptococcus in 4, Stomatococcus mucilaginous in 1, Corynebacterium J.K. in 1, Enterobacter in 3, Acinetobacter in 3 and Pseudomonas in 2. Two cultures were negative. First choice treatment was a daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 g cefotiam. 68.80% of patients recovered within 6 days. Failures were due to a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, a relapsing Stomatococcus mucilaginous infection in 1, a Streptococcus faecalis in 1, an Acinetobacter in 3 and a Pseudomonas in 2. Mean cefotiam concentrations 24 hours after the intraperitoneal injection were 9.4 +/- 7.0 micrograms/ml (range 1.3-26.4 micrograms/ml) in serum and 3.4 +/- 3.3 micrograms/ml (range 0.4-12.2 micrograms/ml) in dialysate. These concentrations are greater than most of cefotiam's MICs for susceptible bacteria, a finding that confirms the value of treatment with a single daily intraperitoneal injection of cefotiam.
TI  - [Treatment of neurosurgical bacterial meningitis using the combination of ceftriaxone-fosfomycin].
AB  - 16 patients with bacterial meningitis following a neurosurgical procedure were given a combination of ceftriaxone and fosfomycin. 8 microorganism were isolated: 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Neisseria meningitidis, 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Serratia marcescens and 1 Aeromonas hydrophila. No pathogen was identified in the remaining cases. All of the isolated strains were susceptible to both antibiotics. In vitro, neither synergy nor antagonism were observed between the two antimicrobial agents. The acute infectious episode resolved in all patients. One relapse only was observed, in a patient with meningitis related to a ventricular shunt, and successfully treated by the same therapeutic schedule associated with removal of the tubing. Lastly, CSF concentrations of both antibiotics were assayed and found to be comparable with those reported by most author.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Thirty patients (17 male, 13 female; age 17 to 84 years; normal renal function in 23 cases) with severe bacterial infections were treated with ceftriaxone. The infections was septicemia in 20 cases, a septicemia-like condition in 2 and a focal infection in 8 (2 abscesses of the lung, 2 pyelonephritis, 1 abscess of the liver, 1 subphrenic abscess, 1 meningitis developed from an abscess of the brain and 1 acute intestinal infection). 25 infections were bacteriologically documented, with recovery of the following pathogens: 20 Gram negative rods (including 10 E. coli) that were all susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC = 0.02 to 0.5 mg/l) except 2 (1 Pseudomonas and 1 E. cloacae), 5 susceptible Gram positive cocci (3 Pneumococcus, 1 Streptococcus and 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis) and 3 susceptible anaerobes (2 B. fragilis and 1 B. melaninogenicus). Ceftriaxone was given alone in 15 cases and in association with another antibiotic in 15 cases (aminoglycoside in 10 cases, nitroimidazole in 4 and fosfomycin in 1). The dose of ceftriaxone was 1 to 2 g per day in 28 cases, 3 g per day in 1 case (meningitis with abscess of the brain) and 1 g every other day in 1 case (chronic renal failure under hemodialysis). Duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 62 days (average 17 days). The usual routes of administration were IV and IM; the SC route was used on 4 occasions. Pharmacokinetic studies of serum levels were carried out in several patients including two who had ceftriaxone subcutaneously; results were consistent with those previously reported in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of timentin in intensive care].
AB  - 16 patients admitted to a MICU were treated with timentin (ticarcillin + clavulanic acid) for bacterial infections: 11 cases of pulmonary infection, 3 cases of urinary tract infection, 2 septic shocks, 3 septicemias and 1 case of multifocal infection. The pathogens considered as a firmly established cause of infection were: 5 Acinetobacter, 12 Pseudomonas, 3 Serratia, 4 Klebsiella, 1 E. coli, 2 Proteus, 1 Providencia, 1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus D and 1 Flavobacterium meningosepticum. The susceptibility of these pathogens to ticarcillin and timentin is reported. Timentin was prescribed alone in 9 cases and associated (with an aminoglycoside) in 7, in a daily dose of 9 to 18 g, for 6 to 45 days. 3 patients died. The value of timentin in infections due to multiresistant MICU pathogens is stressed.
TI  - The in vivo effect of amniotic fluid on endocervical microflora.
AB  - To test the in vivo effect of amniotic fluid on endocervical microflora, we performed endocervical cultures before and after rupture of the membranes in 20 patients in term labor. There were no significant qualitative or quantitative differences in aerobic or anaerobic isolates for up to 4 hours after membrane rupture. Group B streptococci, isolated in two patients (10%), persisted after rupture of the membranes. These data suggest that endocervical cultures are minimally influenced by rupture of the chorioamnion for at least 4 hours.
TI  - Treatment of septic olecranon and prepatellar bursitis with percutaneous placement of a suction-irrigation system. A report of 12 cases.
AB  - Ten cases of septic olecranon bursitis and two cases of septic prepatellar bursitis were treated in the period from 1975 to 1980 with antibiotics and percutaneous tube placement for suction-drainage and local antibiotic irrigation. All patients had positive bacterial cultures: Staphylococcus aureus in nine, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus in two, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one. Intravenous antibiotics, local suction-drainage, and irrigation with a solution of 1% kanamycin and 0.1% polymyxin controlled the infection in each case. The antibiotic treatment averaged 19 days, compared with 24 days in a series in which suction-irrigation was not used. In contrast with studies in which aspiration or incision and drainage were performed, there were no complications or recurrences. Percutaneous suction-irrigation appears to be a safe, effective method of treatment that is particularly beneficial in severe cases of septic bursitis in which continuous drainage is desirable.
TI  - Coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin G and vancomycin. A total of 251 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by an agar dilution method. Clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. All the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. Netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus. The MICs of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin G and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. Coumermycin showed poor activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and enterococci. Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates had also high MICs, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.
TI  - Performance characteristics of a commercially prepared biphasic blood culture bottle.
AB  - A biphasic blood culture bottle (BiPB: GIBCO Laboratories, North Andover, Mass.)  with an architectural design that physically separates the agar slant from the broth was compared with a conventional vented monophasic bottle (MPB-A) for use in the routine culture of blood. Both bottles contained tryptic soy broth. Tryptic soy agar was used for the BiPB slant. A third unvented bottle (MPB-N) with Columbia broth was included as part of the blood culture set. Of 3,537 sets collected, 444 were positive; 57 of these 444 sets were positive by virtue of an exclusively positive anaerobic bottle. Both BiPB and MPB-A were positive in 235 of the remaining 387 positive sets. A total of 521 isolates was recovered during the study. Of these isolates, 252 were recovered in both the BiPB and the MPB-A from the same set; 105 isolates grew in the BIPB but not in MPB-A, 95 isolates grew only in the MPB-A but not in BiPB, and 69 grew exclusively in the MPB-N. The BiPB allowed more rapid recovery of Candida spp., J-K diphtheroids, Pseudomonas spp. Making BiPB subcultures was easy enough to permit both early and daily subculture, which provided isolated colonies sooner than could be done by using the MPB-A. Isolated colonies and, therefore, identification and susceptibility results were available at least 1 day earlier for the BiPB isolates in approximately 50% of instances when both the BiPB and the MPB-A were positive. Staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococci were recovered more frequently in the BiPB, while gram-positive anaerobes were detected at a significantly (P less than 0.025) more frequent rate in the MPB-A than in the BiPB. Either bottle, however, should be used in conjunction with an anaerobic bottle for optimal recovery of anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - The laboratory diagnosis of peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - In 24 episodes of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis associated peritonitis occurring in 21 patients, all dialysis fluids were cloudy and contained at least 100 cells mm-3, mostly polymorphs. Gram-positive cocci were seen in centrifuge deposits from only nine of the fluids, but enrichment of 5 ml in liquoid and glucose broth yielded bacteria for all episodes, namely Staphylococcus epidermidis (seven episodes), Staph. aureus (six), Streptococcus mitior (one), Moraxella spp (four), Acinetobacter spp (three), Enterobacteria (two) and Pseudomonas testosteroni (one). Comparison of washed with unwashed centrifuge deposits gave positive cultures in 11 and 10 fluids respectively; pre-treatment with triton X increased this yield to 19 and 21 positives, respectively. Storage of specimens for 4-12 h at 4 degrees C did not decrease the 100% positive-culture rate. All isolates were sensitive to either gentamicin or vancomycin. Of the 24 dialysis bags from 24 symptomless CAPD patients, none contained more than 60 cells mm-3 and bacteria were not detected by microscopy, culture of the centrifuge deposits, or by enrichment in liquoid or glucose broths.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Extracranial mycotic aneurysms in infective endocarditis.
AB  - Nine of 217 (4.15%) patients with infective endocarditis who were followed from October 1978 to February 1984 had extracranial mycotic aneurysms (MA). Age range of patients was 6-43 years (mean of 24.8 years) and 7 were male. Etiologic agents were Streptococcus viridans (3 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (2 cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1 case), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case). Two patients had negative blood cultures. The MA involved the arteries of the limbs (5 cases), thoracic (3 cases), and abdominal (1 case) arteries. The diagnosis was made by means of physical examination (5 cases), chest roentgenogram (2 cases), ultrasound examination (1 case), and aortography (1 case), at hospital admission (2 cases), early or before antibiotic therapy (2 cases), and from two days to six months after finishing antibiotic therapy (5 cases). All but one patient were operated upon due to MA; bleeding occurred in three cases; surgery was an emergency procedure in one case and performed from 8 to 58 days after the diagnosis of the MA in the others. Signs of infection at surgery were found in one case. In the others, further antibiotic therapy was not administered. There were no limb losses in the peripheral MA. Four patients received surgical treatment for endocarditis. There was one in-hospital death and another one 6 months later due to heart failure.
TI  - Does the hygroscopic property of the laminaria tent imply a risk for ascending infection in legal abortions? A microbiological study.
AB  - In 53 women admitted for first-trimester abortion, the cervical canal was dilated with laminaria tents prior to vacuum aspiration. Before insertion of the tents, endocervical specimens were taken for microbiological investigations, including Chlamydia trachomatis, and both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The laminaria tents, widened by their hygroscopic properties, were removed just before the vacuum aspiration and sent for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. The Gram-positive aerobic cocci, Staph. epidermidis, Strept. faecalis and Strept. agalactiae as well as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter were the most frequent microorganism among the aerobic isolates from the endocervices as well as from the laminaria tents. These microorganisms were identified on the tents in greater numbers than in the cervices. Staph. aureus was isolated from three laminaria tents, but only one of these 3 women was proved to be primarily colonized endocervically. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroidaceae followed by peptococci and peptostreptococci were the predominant genera found in the cervix as well as on the removed laminaria tents. These three groups of anaerobic microorganisms were found markedly less frequently on the laminaria tents than in the endocervix. On the other hand, Strept. intermedius, another anaerobe of possible enteric origin, was recovered from 9 laminaria tents but not in the cervices. Since no cases of clinically verified endometritis/salpingitis were registered in the present study it is concluded that the risk of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to the laminaria tent is negligible as long as the laminaria treatment does not exceed 24 hours.
TI  - Blood culture and echocardiography in diagnosis of infective endocarditis: microbiological and clinical observations.
AB  - Short retrospective review of 77 cases of bacterial endocarditis, observed in the 1980-84 period, and diagnosed by means of echography and blood culture. Alfa haemolytic streptococcus strains were isolated (47.6% of 42 isolated strains) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (16.7%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.9%). Positive bloodculture were more frequent in the patients with valvular prosthesis. The results are analysed and some comments are done.
TI  - Bacterial and candidal cutaneous infections in the neonate.
AB  - The skin and oral cavity of the neonate are colonized by a variety of organisms during the first few days of life. Some of these organisms constitute normal flora, but others are true pathogens or are capable of pathogenicity when host or environmental factors are altered in their favor. Cutaneous bacterial and yeast infections that afflict the newborn are discussed in terms of clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and appropriate management.
TI  - Management of purulent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - In 1985, postoperative purulent endophthalmitis (PPE) was diagnosed in 8 eyes (severe in 5 and presumed in 3 eyes). All were treated with paraocular injections of cefotaxime, gentamicin and triamcinolone with or without the same antibiotics by intraocular and/or systemic route with or without systemic corticosteroids. The suspect causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 3 cases, streptococcus in 1 case, in 2 cases the cause remained unknown. Pars plana vitrectomy and anterior chamber lavage were performed on 5 eyes, and anterior chamber and vitreous tap on 1 eye. The intraocular lens implants were not removed at vitrectomy. A useful vision ranging from 0.15 to 0.6 was obtained in all cases. Our present regime for the management of purulent postoperative or posttraumatic endophthalmitis is given.
TI  - Propionibacteria isolates and asymptomatic infections of the peritoneal effluent  in CAPD patients.
AB  - During the past two years our laboratory has isolated Propionibacterium-an anaerobic Gram-positive rod-on 40 occasions from the drainage fluid of 25 patients on CAPD and eight on IPD. Most patients had no symptoms and the fluid was sent for culture after treatment of peritonitis, during training period, and occasionally because it was cloudy. No association was found with patients' age, length on dialysis, or previous peritonitis episodes. The only statistically significant association (P = 0.033) was with recent (less than 30 days) catheter insertion. Patients with Propionibacterium as the only organism in their dialysis fluid had normal leucocyte count in the effluent, minimal or no symptoms, and received no treatment. In order to establish the frequency of positive cultures of asymptomatic patients, we cultured 95 dialysate effluents from 33 asymptomatic CAPD patients. Cultures were observed for 4 weeks. We found seven positive fluids (7.4%) in four patients (12%), aerobic sporeformer (2), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2) and Streptococcus viridans (1). The mean time to grow was 18.6 days. In conclusion, effluents from asymptomatic CAPD patients may contain bacteria. The organisms are commensals requiring prolonged incubation to grow. Propionibacterium isolated from peritoneal effluent of patients with minimal or no symptoms does not require treatment. These findings suggest that errors in the technique of CAPD are not rare but when the number of organisms is small and the organism has low virulence, peritonitis does not occur.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of primycin against multiple strains of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Crystalline primycin was found to be very active in broth dilution assay against  Staphylococcus aureus (50 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (77 strains), Streptococcus faecalis (76 strains) and one strain of Listeria monocytogenes with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml. The activity was influenced by the pH of the liquid medium with greater activity (lower MICs) at pH 8 against the majority of strains, than at pH 6 or 7.3. In disc agar diffusion assay Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 proved more sensitive than staphylococcus strains.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Growth of bacteria and fungi in total nutrient admixtures.
AB  - Total nutrient admixtures (TNAs) containing dextrose, amino acids, and fat emulsion were evaluated for their ability to support bacterial and fungal growth. The following solutions were tested: a standard adult total parenteral nutrient (TPN) solution with dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes, a standard neonatal TPN solution with dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes, a 10% fat emulsion, a 20% fat emulsion, a TNA with 40% of the total calories as fat, a TNA with 25% of the total calories as fat, a neonatal TNA with 25% of the total calories as fat, a control (fat emulsion was replaced with an equal amount of sterile water) for solution 5, and a control for solution 6. Serial dilutions of each solution were inoculated with 5 X 10(5) bacteria/mL or 5 X 10(3) fungi/mL, incubated, and visually rated on a scale of 0 (no growth) to 4 (maximal growth). Bacterial growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Group JK Corynebacterium was greater in the TNA solutions than in the control or standard TPN solutions. Escherichia coli, Candida tropicalis, and C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. Torulopsis glabrata grew better in solutions that did not contain fat emulsion. Growth characteristics did not differ significantly between the adult and neonatal (more dilute) solutions. The addition of fat emulsion to TPN solutions enhances the ability of these solutions to support bacterial growth; this possibility must be considered when evaluating patients for this type of total parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Semipermeable occlusive dressings. Effects on growth of pathogenic bacteria and reepithelialization of superficial wounds.
AB  - Six commercially available semiocclusive dressings were tested for their effect on the growth of resident and pathogenic bacteria and the reepithelialization of experimentally induced wounds in human volunteers. Scarification and abrasion-type wounds inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were quantitatively cultured at different times after being covered with the dressings. Reepithelialization was assessed by serial stereomicrographs. None of the dressings was able to prevent clinical infection. All dressings provided microenvironments that were conducive to the growth of resident and pathogenic bacteria. There was no difference in the rates of reepithelialization.
TI  - [Clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  - In a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). All the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone or in combination with surgical intervention. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. The 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had MICs between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. The MICs for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the MICs for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. One S. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (MIC 16 mg/l). The tolerability was good. Phlebitis was observed in one case only. Based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of teicoplanin for therapy of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Teicoplanin was evaluated in 47 patients with severe infections, including 14 patients with bone infections, 11 patients with soft-tissue infections, 7 patients with endocarditis, 5 patients with pneumonia, 3 patients with septic thrombophlebitis, 3 patients with septicemia of unknown origin, and 4 patients with miscellaneous infections. Overall, bacteremia was documented in 24 patients. The pathogens isolated were 35 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including 8 methicillin-resistant strains), 4 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 5 strains of other streptococci, and 1 Micrococcus luteus strain. A total of 22 patients (46.8%) were clinically cured, 8 patients (17.0%) improved, 2 patients (4.3%) had relapses after initial improvement, and 15 patients (31.9%) failed to respond. The results were better in nonbacteremic patients (19 of 23 patients [82.6%] were cured or improved) than in patients with bacteremia (12 of 24 patients [50%] were cured or improved). Bacteriological cure occurred in 25 patients (53.2%), and superinfections were documented in 6 patients (12.8%). No major adverse effects were observed. We conclude that teicoplanin is a potentially effective and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent for therapy of nonbacteremic infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. In this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of NBTE (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. The adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. Microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, S. sanguis) bound significantly better (P less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (Escherichia coli, C. krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. Microbial adhesion to fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., ID50) with preexistent NBTE. A similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. The results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of NBTE, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - A bacteriological study of the middle ear and upper respiratory tract in children with chronic secretory otitis media.
AB  - Middle ear effusions and swabs from the external auditory meatus, nasopharynx and anterior nares have been collected from 100 children with chronic secretory otitis media. Isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were typed and in vitro sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics were determined for these species and Staphylococcus aureus. Positive middle ear cultures were obtained from 21 children (27 effusions). Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the commonest organisms isolated, both from the middle ear and upper respiratory tract. When one or other of these species was isolated from the middle ear, the same organism was generally found in the upper respiratory tract, but not in the ear canal. The serotypes isolated from the different sites were also the same. Type 19 was the commonest Pneumococcal serotype isolated, while type e was the commonest capsulated strain of H. influenzae. Thirty-six per cent of strains of H. influenzae were resistant to penicillin and 25% of those of S. pneumoniae were resistant to trimethaprim. Eighty-one per cent of isolates of S. aureus were penicillin resistant. There was no difference in the incidence of either S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae in the post nasal spaces of children who had had their adenoids removed and those who had not.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of antibiotic dry cow teat canal and intramammary dry cow therapy of dairy cows on the prevalence of teat canal and intramammary infections at calving.
AB  - The specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg/0.25 ml and 14 mg/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. Of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. By treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. Untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. Cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  - Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  - Microbiology of recently treated acute otitis media compared with previously untreated acute otitis media.
AB  - Isolates were obtained from 169 middle ear aspirates of 148 children with recently treated acute otitis media (RTOM) and from 123 aspirates of 84 children with previously untreated acute otitis media (UOM). In RTOM Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group A streptococcus (P less than 0.02) were recovered less frequently whereas Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.001) and Haemophilus influenzae (P less than 0.02) were recovered more frequently than in UOM. Patients with RTOM had more beta-lactamase-producing organisms and multiple isolates. Bilateral sterile aspirates were more common in RTOM although bilateral otitis media was more common in UOM. In RTOM most Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were co-pathogens whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis were always isolated in pure culture. Amoxicillin was the antimicrobial most frequently (83.9%) received for the recently treated episode of otitis media. In RTOM 62.4% of isolates were susceptible to previously prescribed antibiotics, suggesting that factors other than antimicrobial susceptibility are also important in the occurrence of RTOM.

TI  - Effects of Corynebacterium bovis infection on susceptibility to major mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of Corynebacterium bovis. Challenge procedures using Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould 305) and Streptococcus agalactiae (McDonald 44) were used to study effects of Corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. Rate of infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with Corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. Principal location of Corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. Quarters with Corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by Staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. Quarters infected with Corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to Streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. Somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed Corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 X 10(5).
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Comparison of arterial and venous blood samples for the diagnosis of bacteremia in critically ill patients.
AB  - We compared the blood culture results obtained either by venipuncture or through  an arterial catheter in 51 critically ill patients with 217 clinically suspected episodes of bacteremia. During each episode, three blood culture samples, two arterial and one venous, were drawn within 1 h. One or more cultures were positive in 42 (19%) of the episodes, but there were great discrepancies between the results obtained by the two methods. In only eight cases did both methods give the same microorganism. In eight other episodes, the two arterial cultures were positive while the venous sample was negative, probably indicating a continuous contamination of the catheter system. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the two most common microbes. The frequency of positive arterial catheter blood cultures did not increase with the length of catheter use. We conclude that an arterial catheter is not a reliable sampling site for blood cultures and does not replace the conventional venipuncture method.
TI  - Presence of laminin receptors in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A characteristic feature of infection by Staphylococcus aureus is bloodstream invasion and widespread metastatic abscess formation. The ability to extravasate, which entails crossing the vascular basement membrane, appears to be critical for the organism's pathogenicity. Extravasation by normal and neoplastic mammalian cells has been correlated with the presence of specific cell surface receptors for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. Similar laminin receptors were found in Staphylococcus aureus but not in Staphylococcus epidermidis, a noninvasive pathogen. There were about 100 binding sites per cell, with an apparent binding affinity of 2.9 nanomolar. The molecular weight of the receptor was 50,000 and pI was 4.2. Eukaryotic laminin receptors were visualized by means of the binding of S. aureus in the presence of laminin. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic invasive cells might utilize similar, if not identical, mechanisms for invasion.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of imipenem: the first thienamycin antibiotic.
AB  - Imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) is the first representative of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics--the carbapenems. Imipenem has an unusually broad spectrum, high potency, and no cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. Susceptible gram-negative species include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, and Enterobacter. Activity is high against Staphylococcus aureus, most group D streptococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis but is variable against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Imipenem is more active against Bacteroides than are other beta-lactam agents, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and clindamycin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 98% of 30,655 isolates--excluding those of the three resistant species (Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Streptococcus faecium)--were less than 8 micrograms/ml, the susceptibility breakpoint adopted for clinical trials. Imipenem is bactericidal (minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs] less than twice the MICs). For P. aeruginosa, MBCs of imipenem are less influenced by high inoculum density rather than are MBCs of antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins. Stability of imipenem to diverse classes of plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases accounts for its lack of cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. Imipenem is also active against P. aeruginosa with non-lactamase-mediated resistance to classical beta-lactam agents. Efficacy of imipenem was shown in animal models, including septicemia in normal and neutropenic rodents and P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Imipenem also has a unique postantibiotic effect against P. aeruginosa in vivo.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  - Imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. The mean duration of treatment was 29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. Causative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, S. aureus plus group B Streptococcus in one, viridans group Streptococcus in two, Neisseria subflava, Eikenella corrodens, and group G Streptococcus in one patient, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Hemophilus aphrophilus, and Enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. The minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04 micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against H. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against E. aerogenes. The site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. The mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. All patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. Adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on Day 26 of therapy. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Culture of the surfaces of urinary catheters to sample urethral flora and study the effect of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - At the time indwelling urinary catheters were removed, the urethral flora was sampled by rolling the catheters onto culture plates. Cultures were obtained from 398 patients with sterile urine. Catheter surfaces were colonized less often in males than in females (16.8 and 67.0%, respectively) and yielded correspondingly fewer bacterial species per catheter. In both sexes, gram-positive species were isolated more frequently than gram-negative species (428 and 131 isolates, respectively). The bacteria most commonly isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Staphylococcus saprophyticus was not recovered despite the large proportion of young, sexually active women in the study population. Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, gradually colonized the catheters over time but at all times were recovered in lower amounts the gram-positive organisms and less often in males than in females. Slime production by coagulase-negative staphylococci did not relate to the density of organisms recovered from the catheters or influence the presence of gram-negative bacteria. Despite frequent use of antibiotics in this population, the urethral flora remained highly susceptible to these drugs. Antibacterial activity was not detected on the catheters despite high concentrations in the urine. This suggests that systemic antibiotics have a very limited effect on resident urethral flora. Despite relatively small numbers in the urethra, gram-negative bacteria readily produce urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.
TI  - Contamination of corneal tissue from infected donors.
AB  - Thirty-two corneas with scleral rims were cultured from the eyes of 17 cadavers that harbored systemic infection at the time of death. Twelve (71%) of 17 cadavers demonstrated corneal contamination from one or both corneas. Eleven (92%) of 12 donors with positive postmortem blood cultures had positive corneal cultures from at least one eye. Six of these 12 had the same organism isolated from both the blood and corneal tissue. Bacterial corneal cultures were negative in the five donors with negative postmortem blood cultures. Control cultures were obtained from 19 eyes of ten donors without evidence of infection at death. Four (21%) of 19 control eyes yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis. There was a significantly higher incidence of corneal contamination in donors who died with systemic infections. Eye banks should continue to screen donors carefully for documented or suspected sepsis in an effort to reduce the incidence of postkeratoplasty infections.

TI  - Current diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  - An analysis was made of 91 cases of infective endocarditis (IE) with regard to causative organisms and their sensitivities to various antibiotics, the clinical features of the disease, the laboratory test results and other items were important in establishing a diagnosis of IE. The number of cases of IE has shown a tendency to increase in recent years, particularly in the number of elderly patients, and the ratio of total cases consisting of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) has shown a sharp increase. The most common causative organism is still Streptococcus viridans, but there has been an increase in the incidence of IE due to benzyl-penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and other fastidious organisms. The percentage of underlying diseases represented by combined valvular diseases has been increasing, while the primary known cause of the infection of IE was dental treatments. A positive value for CRP, an accelerated value for ESR, leukocytosis, anemia, a decrease in serum Fe, a positive value for RA-T, were all parameters which showed a high correlation with IE, and these should be useful in establishing the diagnosis of IE. The use of cardioechography to detect cardiac vegetation is important in relation to establishing the diagnosis and prognosis of IE, and the evaluation of the therapeutic results.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of mupirocin (pseudomonic acid), a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  - Mupirocin (pseudomonic acid A), an antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, showed a high level of activity against staphylococci and streptococci and against certain gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was much less active against most gram-negative bacilli an anaerobes. Nearly all clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains, were susceptible (mupirocin MIC, less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). There was no cross-resistance between mupirocin and clinically available antibiotics, and the selection of resistant variants in vitro occurred at a low frequency. Mupirocin was highly bound (95% bound) to the protein of human serum, and activity was reduced 10- to 20-fold in the presence of human serum. The activity of mupirocin was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was significantly enhanced in acid medium. In tests of bactericidal activity, MBCs were 8- to 32-fold higher than MICs and the antibiotic demonstrated a slow bactericidal action in time-kill tests, resulting in 90 to 99% killing after 24 h at 37 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in American hospitals.
AB  - A total of 5,825,243 strains of bacteria were isolated in 242 American hospitals  during a period of twelve years (1971 to 1982). The susceptibility to antibiotics of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp. Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. did not change significantly during this period of time. The susceptibility to tetracycline for E. coli and S. aureus increased. Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed a decrease in susceptibility.
TI  - Rat bites: fifty cases.
AB  - A prospective study of 50 patients with uninfected rat bite wounds was undertaken to determine the natural incidence of wound infection without prophylactic antibiotics. All open wounds were cultured; bacterial isolates were cultured from 30% of wounds. Of bacterial isolates, 43% were Staphylococcus epidermidis and the remainder were Bacillus subtillus, diphtheroids, and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus. Only one patient (2%) developed an infection. Seventy-two percent of the bites occurred while the patient was sleeping, probably accounting for the fact that 84% of the wounds were on the exposed areas of the upper extremities and face. Treatment recommendations include good surgical management and avoidance of prophylactic antibiotics due to a low natural infection rate. If the wounds become infected, then a cephalosporin or penicillinase-resistant penicillin should be sufficient for treatment with appropriate surgical care of the wounds. Rabies prophylaxis usually is not required, but we suggest that tetanus prophylaxis is mandatory because most of our patients were deficient in this regard.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - An epidemiological survey of urinary tract infections among outpatients in Northern Norway.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) in all outpatients from several municipalities in  Northern Norway were examined during 1 year. Comparatively high frequencies of UTI were found among women of all ages, among people greater than 60 years of both sexes, in coastline municipalities, and during the fall and winter. About 70% of all UTI were caused by Escherichia coli, more in women than in men. Other gram-negative enterobacteria (Klebsiella, Proteus) and gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus, Staph. aureus, Streptococcus faecalis) caused the majority of remaining infections. Relatively more gram-positive cocci (except Staph. saprophyticus) than gram-negative enterobacteria were from males. Patients with gram-positive cocci, except Strep. faecalis, were generally younger than those with gram-negative enterobacteria.
TI  - Respiratory superinfections after the use of third-generation cephem antibiotics.
AB  - This paper is a report on our studies on superinfections in respiratory tract infections treated during the years 1981-1984. The isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to third-generation cephem antibiotics. These organisms proved to be widely distributed in hospitals and were frequently isolated from the sputum, excised lung and cardiac blood. The colonization of the sputum by bacteria in respiratory tract infections before, during and after treatment with third-generation cephem antibiotics revealed a tendency for these organisms to appear after treatment. Among the gram-positive cocci, S. faecium was most resistant to these antibiotics, followed by S. faecalis, S. epidermidis and S. aureus in that order. The incidence of resistant isolates in 1984 exceeded that in 1983, suggesting an annual increase in resistant bacteria.
TI  - Cefotaxime monotherapy of bacterial meningitis caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Primary meningitis in children is caused by two gram-negative bacterial species,  Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, and one gram-positive bacterial species Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite optimal penicillin susceptibility, with few exceptions, therapeutic results in pneumococcal meningitis are by far worse than with the other two pathogens. Therefore, and because of the detection of penicillin-resistant rods, the study of alternatives in therapy is justified and was started with cefotaxime. Including six of our own patients, there are reports on 87 patients in the literature suffering from S. pneumoniae meningitis who were treated with cefotaxime monotherapy. Results of these studies will be analyzed. As none of these patients belonged to a prospective controlled study group, final evaluation in comparison with penicillin therapy remains open. There are also several reports on successful treatment of group B streptococcus meningitis with cefotaxime, although there is no need to abandon penicillin therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis meningitis, usually secondary in shunted hydrocephalus, brain tumors, brain injury or other causes, should not be treated with cefotaxime because of its limited activity on these bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus faecalis are primarily cefotaxime-resistant, and neonatal meningitis of unknown origin, therefore, should not be treated with cefotaxime alone as long as these pathogens cannot be excluded.
TI  - An overview of cefotaxime therapy in infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins against gram-positive pathogens is generally considered to be less than that of earlier cephalosporins, such as cefazolin. A review of pooled pre-release data collected by numerous investigators and supplied by Hoechst-Roussel made it possible to evaluate the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of cefotaxime in more than 900 infections caused by gram-positive organisms. The most commonly isolated pre-treatment organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococcal species. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 95% and the bacteriologic eradication rate was 94.5%. Side-effects were limited to rash in two, diarrhea in one and fever in one. Pain at the administration site was reported by four patients. Comparative studies with cefazolin against S. aureus showed no statistically significant differences in efficacy. The highest failure rates were seen in enterococcal urinary tract infections, as predicted by in vitro sensitivity tests. Cefotaxime appears to be a safe, effective antibiotic for the therapy of infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Superinfections during antimicrobial treatment with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  - The frequency, etiology and risk factors of superinfections during and/or within  one week after antibiotic therapy with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations were evaluated in 631 patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the Institute of Hematology of Rome from January 1982 to December 1984. 356 patients (56%) developed 402 episodes of proven or presumed infection. Of these patients, 78 developed 102 superinfections. Overall, superinfections responded less satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy than the primary febrile episodes (63% vs. 85%). The distribution of etiologic agents of superinfections differed from those responsible for primary infections, since fungi and anaerobes (especially Clostridium difficile) were mostly isolated after antibiotic therapy had begun. Moreover, among aerobic bacteria, frequently antibiotic-resistant species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the leading etiologic agents of superinfection. The risk of superinfection appeared to increase with the depth and persistence of granulocytopenia. On the other hand, the length of hospitalization, length of previous antibiotic therapy, previous chemoprophylaxis and presence of indwelling venous catheter did not affect the risk of superinfection.
TI  - [Current aspects of infectious endocarditis. Review of 101 cases].
AB  - One hundred and one cases of infectious endocarditis were reviewed, from 1966 to  1982. The mean age of the patients was 56.3 +/- 15 years. There was a marked predominance of men (70.2 p. 100); the commonest portal of entry was dental (45.9 p. 100); the number of iatrogenic portals of entry and cases of endocarditis on prosthetic valves has been increasing in recent years. Blood cultures were positive in 83 p. 100 of cases; the commonest responsible organism was the non-D streptococcus (31 p. 100 of cases) followed by the D streptococcus (18.8 p. 100), the staphylococcus aureus (17.8 p. 100), and the staphylococcus epidermidis (2.9 p. 100). Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in 9.9 p. 100 of cases. Rare and slow growing organisms have been isolated since 1977. Echocardiography was then introduced and helped the diagnostic in 70 p. 100 of cases. Circulating immune complexes were measured in 25 patients and were found to be raised in 14 cases (56 p. 100). The commonest complication was cardiac failure (43 p. 100) which led to valve replacement in the acute phase in 14 p. 100 of cases. The occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias was a poor prognostic factor. The other complications were neurological (15 p. 100), renal (10 p. 100), embolic (19 p. 100), and pulmonary (9 p. 100). The mortality rate in the acute phase was 30 p. 100 and the probability of a five year survival was 54 p. 100.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of temocillin in urinary tract infections.
AB  - A group of 27 female and 2 male urological patients, aged 19 to 80 years (mean 44 years), were treated with intravenous temocillin 500 mg twice daily for 5 to 7 days. The diagnoses were acute pyelonephritis (n = 20), acute cystitis (n = 6), and acute cystitis and pyelonephritis combined (3). The causative organisms were Escherichia coli (n = 20). Proteus species (n = 9). Klebsiella species (n = 4). Streptococcus faecalis (n = 2). Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 1), and Providencia stuartii (n = 1). 27 of the 29 patients (93%) were clinically and bacteriologically cured; bacteriuria persisted in 2 patients with prolonged obstructive uropathy. In acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin rapidly decreased, documenting a prompt renal tubular restitution during therapy. The drug was well tolerated and proved very safe with regard to haematological, hepatic and renal parameters. Also, Candida haemagglutination titres did not increase significantly during therapy. Temocillin therapy should preferably be commenced after the results of the urine culture are available.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group B streptococci.
AB  - The relationship between significant bacteriuria (SB), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. From 30 (70%) of the 43 women with SB studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. The same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with Escherichia coli, the one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with Staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. Six of 10 patients with group B streptococci (GBS), 1 of 4 patients with Streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. Serotype III was isolated from 8/10 patients with SB caused by GBS. One child born to a woman with GBS SB but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. The poor predictive value of SB with GBS, S. faecalis and S. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), i.e. AB with bacteria in the urinary bladder. SB with GBS even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftriaxone against clinical bacterial isolates  in Nigeria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin derivative, recently introduced in Nigeria was compared with the activities of other related beta-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cephaloridine, cloxacillin/ampicillin and ampicillin against 530 local clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The spectra of activity and potency of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were generally similar against the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp., Streptococcus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis when compared to cefotaxime. All the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested were less active than ceftriaxone. The action of ceftriaxone was bactericidal and the minimum inhibitory concentration values observed with R-plasmid beta-lactamase mediated resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and N. gonorrhoeae strains did not exceed the maximum value obtained with the beta-lactamase-negative strains.

TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - The relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  - One potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. Between July 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean, elective arterial reconstructive procedures. Control cultures were obtained from adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. Positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0 of 20) (p less than 0.001). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). Our overall graft infection rate since January 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). All three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. Arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. Organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). These patients with culture-positive graft infections were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with negative arterial cultures. Positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). These data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.
TI  - Endogenous infection in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. A feature of bacterial translocation.
AB  - Slc:ddY mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) were examined for persistency of diabetes (changes of indigenous bacterial floras, and bacterial translocation. Significant diabetes (increase in plasma glucose and decrease in insulin) was recognized 2 weeks after the injection, and persisted for 12 weeks. The numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci (including micrococci), and streptococci in caecal and oral floras were significantly increased, but the numbers of anaerobic bacteria in caecal flora were hardly changed. Bacterial translocation of indigenous bacteria to the mesenteric lymph node, lung, or kidney was detectable in some mice 2 weeks after the injection. The incidence of bacterial translocation in these STZ-treated mice then increased; infection caused by several organisms, e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, or Lactobacillus sp., occurred in lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph node. No indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control mice. This endogenous infection may have been due to the over population of several bacterial strains caused by disruption of indigenous floras along with depression of immunological function.
TI  - Intradermal injection of Propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  - The intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of Propionibacterium acnes (CN 6134)  into the ears of female Sprague-Dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with formation of acneiform lesions. Inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. At 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. Histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. Pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. By day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. Three isolates of P. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain CN 6134. In these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. In contrast, samples of Streptococcus lactis, Escherichia coli B, and Staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. Benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of P. acnes CN 6134-induced ear thickening. The corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. The specificity for P. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of thiamphenicol in treatment of nongonococcal urethritis.
AB  - The effect of thiamphenicol on nongonococcal urethritis was compared with that of doxycycline for 122 male patients, 61 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment with thiamphenicol and 61, with doxycycline. Before treatment the urethral discharges showed more than ten polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field, no gram-negative cocci on the smear, and no culture positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Thiamphenicol was given orally in 500-mg doses three times daily (total dose, 1,500 mg per day), and doxycycline was given orally in 100-mg doses three times daily (total dose, 300 mg per day) for seven to 14 days. Thiamphenicol was clinically effective for 86.8% of the men and doxycycline for 86.3%. In the culture-negative group, thiamphenicol was effective in 90% and doxycycline in 92%; there was no statistically significant difference between the two drugs. Of the 122 patients, one (1.6%) in the doxycycline-treated group showed digestive tract disturbance, but this reaction did not require stopping the therapy.
TI  - Chocolate agar, a differential medium for gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Reactions incurred on chocolate agar by gram-positive cocci were correlated with  species identity. Darkening and clearing of the medium was usually associated with the species Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus simulans, and Streptococcus faecalis. Yellowing of chocolate agar was associated with alpha-hemolytic species of Streptococcus. The study demonstrated that reactions occurring on chocolate agar are useful in identifying gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). Susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., and the Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, New York, N.Y., were compared. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year period, whereas Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. The close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in U.S. hospitals. Since most of the species analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  - A review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. An evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean MIC90 being less than 8 mg/l. The MIC90 for cocci, with the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. The MIC90 for all Enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic resistance. Imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the MIC usually being below 1 mg/l even for Bacteroides fragilis. Rare bacteria such as Nocardia asteroides, Listeria monocytogenes or fast growing Mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. Increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. In most species the MBC only slightly exceeded the MIC; however in the case of Streptococcus faecalis the MBC value was many times the MIC value. Synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. Imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. Induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
AB  - The antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and Enterobacter spp. All of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with MICs ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. The antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3H]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, DNA was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. This suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial DNA.
TI  - Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.
AB  - Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Drug resistance in Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - A total of 1,278 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 688 of Str. faecium and 796 of Staphylococcus epidermidis were collected from laboratory animals of 20 colonies in 1980, and tested for their resistance to 20 drugs. Thirteen percent of Str. faecalis, 12% of Str. faecium and 25% of Staph. epidermidis were drug resistant. Multiple drug resistant organisms were frequently detected in laboratory animal colonies where antibiotic treatment had been undertaken. TC-resistant streptococci and EM-resistant Staph. epidermidis were distributed in about half of the colonies regardless of the history of antibiotic usage.
TI  - Umbilical cord care. A study of bacitracin ointment vs. triple dye.
AB  - Umbilical cord colonization rates were examined over a 4-year period following topical application of bacitracin (1978-1980) or triple dye (1980-1982). A total of 2402 cords were cultured: 1229 following bacitracin cord care and 1173 after triple dye application. Cords treated with bacitracin had significantly higher colonization rates when compared to triple dye prophylaxis. Bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus was found only after bacitracin prophylaxis. Our data support the use of triple dye for routine cord care and suggest that bacitracin application may increase the rate of group B streptococcal colonization.
TI  - Experimental anaerobic brain abscess. Computerized tomographic and neuropathological correlations.
AB  - The neuropathological progression of brain abscess formation induced by a mixed anaerobic culture of Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was studied experimentally in dogs. Histological findings were correlated with computerized tomographic (CT) brain scans. The evolution of brain abscess formation could be divided into three stages based on histological criteria: early cerebritis (Days 1 to 3); late cerebritis (Days 4 to 9); and capsule formation (Day 10 and later). Capsule formation could not be divided into early and late stages because encapsulation was delayed compared with a previously reported model of alpha-Streptococcus brain abscess. Histologically, there was evidence for a very virulent infection. Leptomeningitis was significant even in the late stages. Early ventricular rupture occurred in 25% of the animals. A pattern of extensive purulent encephalitis was seen in 25% of the animals. In the early cerebritis stage, blood vessels near the necrotic center were engorged and were surrounded by hemorrhage and/or protein-rich fluid. Cerebral edema was extensive. Although fibroblasts appeared in late cerebritis, there was marked delay of capsule formation. Three-week-old lesions still had areas of incomplete capsule formation and foci of uncontrolled infection. In the cerebritis stages, CT scans showed an area of ring enhancement which was incomplete on early scans (at 5 minutes after injection of contrast material) but partially filled in and thickened on delayed scans (at 20 to 45 minutes). On even later delayed scans there was no decrease in intensity of ring enhancement. Lesions in which capsule formation occurred also showed ring enhancement, but delayed scans showed a decrease in the intensity of enhancement. The lesions that ruptured into the ventricular system showed atypical CT findings, with either lack of contrast enhancement (histologically there was minimal cerebritis adjacent to the abscess cavity) or a marked delay in contrast enhancement (cerebritis was more extensive and corresponded to the width of ring of enhancement). This study suggests that Bacteroides fragilis is a virulent organism in the brain. The developing abscesses enlarged quickly, were prone to early ventricular rupture, and showed incomplete and delayed encapsulation.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of azlocillin and carbenicillin against 856 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - Eight hundred and fifty-six strains of more than ten species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp and Acinetobacter spp, were tested by the disc diffusion method against azlocillin and carbenicillin. Azlocillin was found to be superior to carbenicillin against Pseudomonas spp, and more than 90% of the tested strains had minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values well below the serum levels attainable after recommended doses of azlocillin. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive cocci, however, azlocillin seemed to have little to offer.
TI  - Relationships between linear type scores, objective type measures, and indicators of mastitis.
AB  - Objectives were to examine the usefulness of objective measures of conformation and linear scores for type for predicting indicators of mastitis. Approximately 300 cows in five herds were scored in the experimental linear classification program of the Holstein-Friesian Association of America, measured objectively for numerous components of conformation, and evaluated for four indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were average natural logarithm of somatic cell counts during the lactation, percent of samples (taken approximately every 3 mo) infected during a lactation, percent of samples infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and percent of samples with signs of mastitic milk. Relationships between conformation and mastitis often were inconsistent because of moderate or low correlations between indicators of mastitis. Indicators of mastitis were predicted from results of multiple regression analyses with subjective scores and objective measures of type as independent variables. Largest differences of predicted indicators of mastitis from variation in any single type trait were sufficient to be important economically, but average differences were much smaller. Selection to reduce frequencies of cows with deep udders, especially low rear udders, widely placed teats, rear teats too far back, and teats that are short and wide, may augment, modestly, efforts to reduce incidence of mastitis through improved sanitation, antibiotic treatment, and proper milking procedures.
TI  - Influence of ethanol with and without chlorhexidine on the bacterial colonization of the umbilicus of newborn infants.
AB  - The effect of daily treatments with 70% ethanol and with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol, respectively, on navel colonization in newborns has been studied in 624 infants in two maternity wards during a four-month period. Staphylococcus aureus, group B and G streptococci, E. coli and anaerobes were significantly less often isolated from newborns whose umbilical cord was treated with chlorhexidine in ethanol than from those treated with ethanol only. Staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococci, on the other hand, were significantly more often isolated from the chlorhexidine-ethanol than from the ethanol group. More infants without colonization of the umbilicus on their fourth day of life were found in the chlorhexidine in ethanol than in the ethanol group. The infants in the ethanol group were colonized with significantly more bacterial species than the infants in the other group. Signs of dissemination of group B and group G streptococci between babies were seen more often in the group of infants treated with ethanol than in the one treated with chlorhexidine-ethanol.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of coumermycin alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - Coumermycin has been shown to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains that are susceptible and those that are resistant to methicillin at concentrations less than or equal to 0.05 micrograms/ml. Listeria monocytogenes and Corynebacterium spp. resistant to cephalosporins were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.6 micrograms of coumermycin ml, and streptococcal species, with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis, were inhibited by 0.1 micrograms/ml. Cross-resistance with beta-lactams or aminoglycosides was not found. Coumermycin acted synergistically with ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin against S. aureus but did not show synergy when combined with nafcillin, vancomycin, or rifampin. Coumermycin did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - Acetic, propionic, and oleic acid as the possible factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of Propionibacterium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on normal human skin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of acetic and propionic acid for resident bacteria on normal human skin, such as Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was 25 mg/mL or more at any pH tested (pH 5.5-6.8). While the MIC of these acids for most of the transient bacteria was markedly decreased by lowering the pH of the media and at pH 5.5, the mean pH value of the normal human skin, the MIC was 6.25 mg/mL or less. The MIC of oleic acid for some strains of Gram-positive transient bacteria of Streptococcus, Micrococcus, or Bacillus was 100 micrograms/mL or less at all pH's tested. Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to this acid at pH 6.8, but became as sensitive as Streptococcus when the pH was lowered. The growth of P. acnes, the most predominant resident bacterium, was enhanced markedly and reached a maximum level at 6.25 mg/mL of propionic acid, 12.5 mg/mL of acetic acid, and 50-100 micrograms/mL of oleic acid. On the basis of these results, we presumed that acetic, propionic, and oleic acids are factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of Propionibacterium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on normal human skin.
TI  - [Doxycycline in the treatment of non-specific urethritis and/or prostatitis].
AB  - Twenty-five men with non-specific urethritis/adnexitis were treated with 200 mg doxycycline monohydrate daily (Vibramycin Tabs) over a period of 10 days. More than half of the patients suffered from chronic inflammations. Microorganisms isolated from urethral secretion and prostate exprimate comprised aerobes, in particular staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis, as well as mycoplasmae, chlamydiae, and anaerobes, mainly bacteroides species and peptostreptococci. Fourty percent of patients additionally had anatomical alterations such as constrictions or strictures of the lower urinary tract. After 10-day therapy with doxycycline 16 out of 24 patients (67%) could be cured and a further six patients (25%) could be improved. Microbiological cure could be achieved in infections with chlamydiae in all cases, in infections with mycoplasmae in 67%, in infections with anaerobes in 80%, and in infections with aerobes in 57% of cases. Overall, the therapeutical success in the investigated patient population with chronic infections which are difficult to treat has therefore to be regarded as excellent. Therapy had to be discontinued in one patient after 3 days due to diarrhoea and nausea. In the other patients toleration of doxycycline was good.
TI  - Microbial flora in semen of asymptomatic infertile men.
AB  - A microbiological examination has been carried out in 116 patients with unexplained infertility and with asymptomatic bacteriospermia. Organisms more frequently isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis (81.9%), non hemolytic streptococci (23.3%), diphtheroids (25%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (18.1%). None of the 103 patients were positive for C. trachomatis. Mycoplasmas were isolated in 56 (48.3%) of the 116 examined samples, U. urealyticum was present in 49 (42.2%), M. hominis in 3 (2.6%) and both species in 4 (3.5%) samples of examined fluids. Forty-one of the 56 mycoplasmas-positive patients have been treated with doxycycline therapy. The treatment improved motility and caused decrease of coiled tails in 12 cases. Conception occurred in 5 (26.3%) of the 19 treated patients whose cultures were negative for mycoplasmas. These 5 pregnancies occurred in the patients that had high titers (greater than 10(5) c.c.u./ml) of ureaplasmas and in which the antibiotic therapy was successful. No pregnancy was seen in the other 22 patients where treatment failed to eradicate mycoplasmas.
TI  - [Development of bacterial flora in leg ulcer].
AB  - In the present study of the microbiological flora of 284 ulcera crurum we found 452 various bacterial strains. 174 (61.3%) of the 284 ulcera crurum were found in women, 110 (38.7%) in men with a predominance in the age group between 70-79 years. Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent bacteria, with an isolation rate of 22,4%. Furthermore, gram-negative bacteria like pseudomonas (14.6%), proteus (10.2%) were isolated. Besides these other species of the group of enterobacteriaceae must be taken into consideration--especially Enterobacter and Klebsiella. In comparison to the results of bacterial isolation rates reported in the literature of the last 15 years, it is obvious that staph. aureus is most common in the bacterial invasion of ulcera crurum . An increase of isolation rates of pseudomonas and proteus and other gram-negative germs could not be found during the last 10 years. The variety of bacterial species on leg ulcers and the frequent occurrence of mixed flora give evidence of the importance of microbiological diagnostic and antibacterial therapy.
TI  - A-16686, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes. II. Biological properties.
AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  - The gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. Gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. A colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Fusobacterium sp. was established. These gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. Except for the presence of large numbers of Bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of S. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. Bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism in conventional gerbils. Microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. Intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. Intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils were similar. Histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. Spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. Statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of teichomycin and vancomycin alone and in combination with rifampin and aminoglycosides against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - The activity of teichomycin A2 was compared with that of vancomycin in vitro against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. Teichomycin A2 was more active than vancomycin active against all isolates tested. Synergistic studies also demonstrated that teichomycin A2 combined with rifampin is more active than vancomycin combined with rifampin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Teichomycin A2, either singly or in combination with an aminoglycoside, was more active against Streptococcus faecalis isolates.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - Echocardiographic features of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis.
AB  - Abnormal echocardiographic findings in seven cases of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis were confirmed in six at operation. The echocardiograms showed three cases with thickening and increased echo intensity (group 1) and four (group 2) in which vegetations were seen initially without either of the two features in group 1. Two patients in group 1 had vegetations, the causative organism being a streptococcus. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative organism in three of the four cases in group 2; in two of these rapidly growing vegetations were detected. The large vegetations obstructed the ostium of the bioprosthetic valve. Thus if vegetations are detected in cases in which staphylococci are the causative bacteria surgery should be performed as soon as possible. In patients who develop a fever after bioprosthetic valve replacement and especially in those with evident bacteraemia echocardiography should be repeated frequently so that lesions may be detected early.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  - The viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. Species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. The reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. Pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. There appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. The bactericidal activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.

TI  - Evaluation of three 4"-deoxy-4"-sulfonamido-oleandomycin derivatives with erythromycin-like antibacterial potency.
AB  - Three derivatives of oleandomycin in which the C"-4 hydroxyl moiety was replaced  for the first time with a nitrogen functionality have been compared with erythromycin base and oleandomycin base. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of these derivatives for 90% of a group of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were one-half to one-fourth those of erythromycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the experimental macrolides for 50% of a group of S. aureus isolates resistant to greater than 12.5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml ranged from 0.2 to 0.39 micrograms/ml. The activities of these experimental compounds were equivalent to the activities of erythromycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus influenzae isolates. In general, erythromycin was more active against Streptococcus species. Each experimental macrolide was superior to erythromycin in inhibiting RNA-directed, cell-free polypeptide synthesis. The three experimental compounds were markedly more active than erythromycin base after oral administration to mice infected with S. aureus. The 50% protective doses of the experimental compounds ranged from 27.4 to 45.7 mg/kg; that of erythromycin was approximately 100 mg/kg.
TI  - Cefuroxime in acute septic arthritis.
AB  - Cefuroxime was used in 17 patients with clinical, bacteriological and/or laboratory signs of acute septic arthritis in comparison with 10 patients given cloxacillin and ampicillin alone, or in combination. 14 patients in the study group had positive cultures (Staphylococcus aureus, 10, S. epidermidis, 1, Streptococcus pyogenes group G, 2 and Acinetobacter, 1). Three more patients with non-bacterial arthritis were included in an antibiotic penetration study. In 6 patients serum and joint fluid concentrations of cefuroxime were repeatedly determined by an assay using high pressure liquid chromatography. After 1.5 g intravenous cefuroxime the joint fluid concentrations were 16-80 and 5-40 mg/l at 2 and 8 h, respectively, exceeding the serum concentrations during that period of time. From the clinical and pharmacokinetic data a dosage of 1.5 g cefuroxime intravenously t.i.d. is recommended to the adult patient. This high dosage resulted in primary healing in 11 patients with one relapse one year later in a patient with a knee arthroplasty. Half the dosage intramuscularly in 6 patients failed in 2. No side effects were seen during cefuroxime therapy.
TI  - [Comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. Apropos of  135 cases].
AB  - The formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as Proteus sp. and some other bacteria. Ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. Its significance in the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. In this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and U. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained Proteus (27), E. coli (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Streptococcus D (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Corynebacterium (1), Candida albicans (1). U. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. Different bacteria were isolated from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). This findings suggest that Ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.

TI  - Characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for lipoteichoic acid from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A hybrid cell line, 3G6, producing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the polyglycerophosphate (PGP) backbone of lipoteichoic acids has been derived by the polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified glucosyltransferase from culture supernatant of Streptococcus mutans strain 6715. Immunodiffusion tests and ELISA revealed that the antibody reacted with purified PGP from group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain Sv as well as crude phenol-water and saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria except for a few species such as biotype B S. sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Actinomyces viscosus. Whole cells of serotype b S. mutans and Staphylococcus epidermidis were agglutinated upon addition of 3G6 mAb, while those of most other species were not significantly affected by this procedure. A hapten inhibition study showed that glycerophosphate was only a potent inhibitor of passive hemagglutination reactions between LTA coated sheep erythrocytes and 3G6 mAb.
TI  - Chloralanyl and propargylglycyl dipeptides. Suicide substrate containing antibacterials.
AB  - A set of dipeptides containing the amino acid residues beta-chloroalanine and propargylglycine, which are mechanism-based inactivators of purified microbial enzymes (alanine racemase and cystathionine gamma-synthase, respectively), have been synthesized, and their antibacterial properties in vitro have been evaluated. Dipeptides containing a single beta-chloro-L-alanyl residue (e.g., 3, 5, 9, and 10) or a single L-propargylglycyl residue (e.g., 12 and 15) are potent antibacterials. The in vitro antibiotic activity of beta-chloro-L-alanine and of L-propargylglycine is increased as much as 4000-fold by incorporation of these residues into a dipeptide. Compounds that contain only a single enzyme-inactivating amino acid together with a second L-alanyl residue (3, 5, 12, and 15) have a restricted range of activity: of the species tested, only Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis are sensitive. However, peptides that contain two suicide-substrate residues [e.g., beta-Cl-LAla-beta-Cl-LAla (8) or LppGly-LppGly (18)] are broad-spectrum antibacterials; as many as 12 different species of the 16 surveyed are sensitive. Dipeptides that contain an amino-terminal L-methionyl (9) or an L-norvalyl (10) residue and a carboxy-terminal beta-chloro-L-alanyl unit are also effective against a large number of organisms; the spectra of activity are like those seen for 8 and 18. A "mixed" dipeptide [beta-Cl-LAla-LppGly, (21)] gives apparent synergism of antibiotic action of beta-chloro-L-alanine and of L-propargylglycine when these two residues are incorporated into a single structure. Peptides of the D,D configuration (4, 6, 13, 16, and 20) and ones of L,D stereochemistry (e.g., 7) are not antibacterials. Peptides containing one (11 and 14) and two (17) D,L-propargylglycyl residues are unresolved sets of diastereomers; the mixtures of compounds are between two- and fourfold less active than the correspondingly resolved L,L dipeptides (12, 15, and 18). These findings are consistent with a mechanism of action for these antibiotics involving stereoselective processing of the peptidyl unit in vivo.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Urethral meatal colonization in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated bacteriuria.
AB  - Urethral meatal colonization with potential urinary tract pathogens was studied before bacteriuria in 31 consecutive acute spinal cord injury patients on an open ward (137 cultures) and 18 renal homotransplant patients in reverse isolation (80 cultures). All patients required indwelling urethral catheterization and no antimicrobials were given. Daily quantitative cultures of the urethral meatus, and bladder and drainage bag urine were obtained. The urethra was the source for 11 of 31 episodes of bacteriuria (35 per cent). Urethral meatal colonization with the organism responsible for bacteriuria, that is Escherichia coli (5 episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), was persistent and present from 2 to 5 days before bacteriuria. In each ward 81 per cent or more of the cultures obtained on day 1 of catheterization showed no gram-negative colonization. Subsequently, the gram-negative colonization density increased in both groups but the increase was significant (p less than 0.001) only for patients on the open ward. Similar trends were observed for gram-positive colonization. The prevalence of potential pathogens was similar for patients whether or not they suffered bacteriuria. An increased density of bacterial colonization was associated with increased susceptibility to bacteriuria but the specific urethral meatal flora was not always predictive of the species responsible for bacteriuria.
TI  - Effects of antibiotic treatment of nonlactating dairy cows on antibiotic resistance patterns of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance patterns of the major groups of bovine mastitis pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, other streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were examined by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 13 different antibiotics against bacterial isolates from dairy cattle. The bacterial strains were obtained from milk samples from each cow in 21 New York state dairy herd surveys. In 12 herd surveys (high antibiotic-use group), all 365 cows received antibiotic infusions into the udder at the cessation of each lactation cycle. The 324 animals in the other nine herd surveys (low antibiotic-use group) did not routinely receive antibiotics during the nonlactation period. The MICs from the two groups were compared by calculating for each bacterial group the average MIC, the antibiotic concentration necessary to inhibit 90% of the isolates, and the antibiotic concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of the isolates. Increased resistance to all 13 antibiotics was observed with Streptococcus agalactiae isolates from the high antibiotic use herds. However, there was relatively little difference between the two groups in the resistance patterns of the other bacterial species examined. The most important finding of the study was the identification of a multiple beta-lactam resistance phenotype in Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  - Aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). A total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). There were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including Hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and Staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). Fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and Propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).
TI  - [Bacterial species recently isolated from urinary tract infections and their antibiotic susceptibility, with special reference to acute cystitis].
AB  - Numbers of the strains of each bacterial species isolated from urinary tract infections were summed and their incidences were calculated for each a half year from the second half of 1980 to the first half of 1982. The incidences of Escherichia coli strains were found to be greatly reduced and those of Streptococcus faecalis strains were greatly increased. Those of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were also increased. This trend was thought to be caused by the extensive and exclusive use of cephalosporin derivatives. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), latamoxef (LMOX) and minocycline (MINO) against these isolated strains were estimated. The most sensitive drugs for E. coli were found to be CZX, LMOX, GM and AMK, CZX and MINO for Klebsiella, CZX and LMOX for Proteus, and GM for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All Gram-positive cocci were found generally to be most susceptible to MINO, but S. faecalis and other Pseudomonas were also sensitive to ABPC. Exclusive use of cephalosporins for the treatment may induce selective increases of the resistant species in normal flora. Since these flora could be the causative agents for various infections, these selections caused by the exclusive use of the monotype drugs are not preferable, and various different drugs should be used for the suitable cases.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. Sampling was by syringe aspiration. Strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. Randomly selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. Seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. One abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, Streptococcus milleri. Streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. The common oral streptococcus, Streptococcus sanguis, constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, other Bacteroides including B. oralis and B. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections. A review of 35 infections in 32 patients.
AB  - The authors have reviewed the clinical manifestations and therapy of hydrocephalus shunt infections in 32 patients with a total of 35 shunt infections. These 35 infections accounted for 43 hospital admissions. First infections usually developed within 2 months following surgery. At the time of diagnosis, 89% of patients were febrile. Fever and cough as a symptom complex characterized the initial clinical presentation in six of 19 episodes of infection complicating ventriculoatrial (VA) shunts, as compared with none of 21 episodes in which infection complicated ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. Seven of 21 infectious episodes occurring in patients with VP shunts in situ were associated with significant abdominal pain and tenderness. These patients usually had no other clinical features to suggest shunt infection. Both of these symptom complexes often led to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Causative organisms included Staphylococcus epidermidis in 21, Staphylococcus aureus in seven, Gram-negative aerobic bacilli in seven, diphtheroids in five, Streptococcus species in four, and anaerobes in three. Five infections were polymicrobial in nature. Positive blood cultures were seen in 13 of 17 infectious episodes complicating VA shunts, as compared with only three of 13 other infections. When the shunt was completely removed, with or without replacement, all 13 patients were cured. When intravenous antibiotics were administered in conjunction with incomplete shunt removal, only eight of 15 courses resulted in cure. Intraventricular antibiotics were administered in four patients and all were cured. Therapy of shunt infections with parenteral antibiotics and incomplete shunt removal is associated with an unacceptably high failure rate.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - [Choice of nutrient media for the laboratory diagnosis of Streptococcus group B].
AB  - The comparative study of a large assortment of liquid and solid culture media used for the cultivation of streptococci in laboratory practice in the USSR and abroad was carried out with the aim of selecting the optimal media for the laboratory diagnosis of group B. streptococci. Liquid media were tested with the use of 7 streptococcal reference strains, and some of these media, found to yield the best results, were selected for tests on clinical material. The use of liquid accumulation media was shown to permit the isolation of group B. streptococcal strains which could not be detected by the direct inoculation of clinical material into dishes with blood agar. The character of hemolysis induced by group B. streptococci in solid media with 5% of blood added was found to depend on the composition of the medium and the conditions of cultivation.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of teichomycin compared with those of other antibiotics.
AB  - The glycopeptide antibiotic teichomycin had in vitro activity comparable to that  of vancomycin against most gram-positive species, and it inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It was twofold more active against many S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolates than was vancomycin. Teichomycin had activity comparable to that of vancomycin against Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus faecalis. It was generally more active against streptococci than was vancomycin. There were no major differences between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of these drugs. Teichomycin acted synergistically with gentamicin against some bacteria.
TI  - Bacteremia in a Veterans Administration Medical Center (1961-1981).
AB  - Laboratory data on blood cultures were reviewed for the period 1961-1981. Blood cultures accounted for 18% of all bacterial cultures. Nine percent of all blood cultures were positive for growth, including pathogens and contaminants. Of these, 21% wer contaiminants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common contaminant while Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently occurring pathogens, respectively. Four percent of all positive blood cultures, involving pathogens, had multiple organisms with E. coli the most common. There was no drastic change in the frequency of occurrence of Gram negative or positive isolates over the years, but certain pathogens like Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp. and Group A Streptococci were more common from 1971-81 than 1961-70. One percent of all patients with positive blood cultures had the same organism for two months or longer. Analysis of these longer occurring infections yielded a mean of 15, median of 7 and range of 2-87 months. E. coli was the most common pathogen in these chronic infections, followed by S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively.
TI  - Association of bacteriuria and pyuria during intermittent catheterization after spinal cord injury.
AB  - Because patients on intermittent catheterization often suffer asymptomatic bacteriuria it is important to know how serious such a colonization may be. We followed 156 hospitalized spinal cord injury subjects on intermittent catheterization. Daily bacterial cultures were performed. When bacteriuria was detected bacterial cultures and uncentrifuged urinary leukocytes were quantified. Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis, produced minimal white cell response, even in high colony counts. However, gram-negative and fungal organisms elicited significant pyuria. Analysis of pyuria in conjunction with urine cultures may serve as a clinical guide to treatment of significant bacteriuria.
TI  - Microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  - Primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. After sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. Furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria Escherichia coli K 12 and Staphylococcus aureus SG 511. Microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. The following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with Candida albicans). 2. Cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. Only one semen sample was contaminated with bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and Streptococcus nonhaemolyticus). Non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (Micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. Test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.
TI  - [Combination between fosfomycin and oxacillin or cefotaxime against methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and Enterococci].
AB  - The resistance of Gram positive cocci to oxacillin and cephalosporins do not appear to be in relation with the synthesis of a beta-lactamase, thus fosfomycin (FOS) could enhance the action of beta-lactam antibiotics by blocking another stage of the peptidoglycan synthesis. When FOS is combined with oxacillin (OXA) or cefotaxime (CTX) against fosfomycin sensitive strains (25 S. aureus 4-16 mg/l, 20 S. epidermidis 2-32 mg/l and 20 Enterococci 16-64 mg/l) one can see a dramatic synergistic effect of these two combinations. Respectively with S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Enterococci, FIC indices are 0.17-0.39 and 0.43 for FOS-OXA and 0.29-0.47 and 0.29 for FOS-CTX. If one considers the CSF concentrations of these three antibiotics, the combination of fosfomycin with oxacillin or cefotaxime may be used in the treatment of meningitis due to methicillin resistant Staphylococci.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin (MK366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (MIC90) by 4 mg/l; MICs of the Enterobacteriaceae including Serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. There was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with MICs less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an MIC90 less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 Pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 Streptococcus bovis strains. In contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). Norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of the new quinoline derivative ciprofloxacin (BAY 0 9867) was evaluated in comparison to norfloxacin and nalidixic acid using 495 clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The compound was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs ranging from 0.008 mg/l to 4 mg/l, whereas the MICs of norfloxacin ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 16 mg/l. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were inhibited with a concentration of 2 mg/l ciprofloxacin and 32 mg/l norfloxacin. Ciprofloxacin was also active against gram-positive cocci. The MICs for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis ranged from 0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. The activity of ciprofloxacin was only slightly influenced by inoculum size, whereas an acid environment caused a noticeable decrease in the activity. Ciprofloxacin would seem to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infection.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of moxalactam: evidence of decreased efficacy in gram-positive aerobic infections.
AB  - Moxalactam was used as initial, empirical therapy in 69 patients with a variety of serious bacterial infections, 32% of which were accompanied by bacteremia. Overall, the success rate was 83% and drug-related adverse effects were minimal. The drug was less efficacious in infections caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens than it was in those caused by gram-negative pathogens. The following gram-positive organisms were associated with special problems during moxalactam therapy: Streptococcus pneumoniae (development of meningitis and a relapse of pneumonia with a more resistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (in vivo emergence of moxalactam resistance, and the enterococci (failure of therapy and a fatal superinfection. Moxalactam performed well in infections caused by most gram-negative organisms, including aminoglycoside-resistant strains, but the previously reported emergence of gram-negative bacillary resistance to moxalactam during therapy was reconfirmed in our series with Serratia marcescens. The use of moxalactam in the treatment of gram-negative meningitis was further supported by a patient with meningitis-ventriculitis caused by Bacteroides fragilis who was cured with moxalactam after failure on chloramphenicol.
TI  - Bacteriologic contamination in an air-fluidized bed.
AB  - An air-fluidized bed was found to be a potential bacteriologic hazard when used by heavily infected burned patients. Even after following the manufacturer's protocol for eliminating bacteria from the bed and for cleaning the filter sheet, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens were recovered. Use of the bed was suspended until an effective disinfecting procedure was developed for the filter sheet and weekly removal of solid materials from the bed was instituted.
TI  - Treatment of serious infections with moxalactam.
AB  - In 93 hospitalized patients, 111 bacterial infections were treated with moxalactam. Eighty-three infections responded well to therapy, nine infections failed to respond to therapy or relapsed, and nine infections showed superinfection with resistant bacteria. The great majority of bacteria isolated had mean inhibitory concentrations below levels readily achieved in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, bile, abscess fluid, and peritoneal fluid. Among the commonly identified bacteria, only Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had variable sensitivity to moxalactam.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - [Intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  - Bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. The following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with diseases or died: Escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); Vibrio genitalis (3.86%); Streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); Staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); Proteus sp. (1.62%); Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); Pasteurella multocida (0.11%). The serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. Demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. The tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. There were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. I. Laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  - Five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. After antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.
TI  - Rapid identification of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood cultures.
AB  - Simultaneous application of the lysostaphin sensitivity test for identification of Staphylococcus aureus and the deoxycholate test for the identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae was evaluated for reliability in rapid identification (1 h) of these organisms from blood cultures by using BACTEC 6B and 7C bottles. The procedure was applied to 127 cultures, 74 lysostaphin tests and 53 deoxycholate tests. Lysostaphin-tested organisms included 23 S. aureus, 40 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Listeria sp., 1 Peptococcus sp., 2 Micrococcus sp., 2 diphtheroids, and 5 mixed cultures. Deoxycholate-tested organisms included 14 S. pneumoniae, 32 Streptococcus spp. (not S. pneumoniae), 1 Listeria sp., 1 Peptococcus sp., 2 diphtheroids, and 3 mixed cultures. Analysis of the data revealed positive and negative predictive values of 95.8 and 94%, respectively, for the lysostaphin test and 100 and 97.4%, respectively, for the deoxycholate test. The combined tests provide rapid reliable identification or elimination of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in blood cultures.
TI  - Physiology and ecology of the vagina.
AB  - The human vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium which has no glands.  Major components of the vaginal secretions are transudate through the vaginal walls, desquamating epithelial cells, cervical mucus, fluids from the upper genital tract, and leukocytes. Estrogens and sexual stimulation are examples of factors which increase vaginal fluid. Major organic constituents of the vaginal fluid are proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Organic acids arise as metabolic byproducts of vaginal bacterial flora, cause the vaginal odor, and show cyclic changes except in oral contraceptive users. Qualitative and quantitative studies in humans as well as animal model studies have confirmed that the vaginal flora is a dynamic and closely interrelated system. Lactobacilli are most prevalent, but many other facultative and anaerobic organisms are present. An inverse relationship exists between the concentration of lactobacilli and other bacteria such as anaerobes. Aerobic bacteria decrease premenstrually whereas anaerobes, in general, remain at constant levels. During menarche, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, and postoperative trauma, dramatic changes occur in the microbial flora. The role of an IUD in causing changes in the microbial flora is under great scrutiny at the present time. Overall, disturbances in the vaginal ecosystem may have a potential impact on many diseases, and thus deserve careful studies.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic aspects of serious infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - 10 patients with serious infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis (8 cases of endocarditis in non-prosthetic valves, 1 was complicated by osteomyelitis, 1 case of osteomyelitis, and 1 case of septicemia) are described. Clinical and microbiologic features were evaluated including antibiotic sensitivity and synergy studies, phage typing and biotyping. Endocarditis tended to affect the elderly population and the clinical manifestations were quite similar to those caused by Streptococcus viridans. Both patients with osteomyelitis had involvement of the cervical spine with excellent response to antibiotic therapy. The only patient with septicemia acquired via hyperalimentation had delayed clearance of the bacteremia but ultimately responded to intravenous antibiotics. Rifampicin was the most effective of all antibiotics tested. All isolates were sensitive to penicillinase-resistant penicillins and cephalosporins and over half were sensitive to penicillin. Full synergistic activity was demonstrated with cephalothin and nafcillin in combination with rifampicin, and rifampicin-vancomycin was partially synergistic against the majority of the strains. Five of 8 available isolates were non-phage typeable and no definite pattern was established for various types of infections. Four of the 8 isolates were classified as biotype SIIa, 2 biotype SIIc and 2 biotype SVh.
TI  - [Experimental mastitis in cows caused by Staphylococci, Streptococci and Corynebacteria].
AB  - Mastitis was experimentally induced in seven cows of the Black-and-white breed through the intramammary or i/v application of bacterial cultures of the encapsulated variant of Staph. epidermidis as well as of Str. agalactiae and Cor. pyogenes. The disease ran a course with high body temperature, strongly manifested inflammatory changes in the mammary gland, and altered phagocytic activity. It was found that the introduction into the mammary gland of a 'stable-specific' bovine blood serum in combination with the preparation nitrofuridine (a Shiff base of the 5-nitrofurfurol with sulfaguanidine) which boosts the phagocytic activity, had produced a therapeutic effect.
TI  - A controlled trial of cefaclor versus amoxicillin for treatment of acute otitis media in early infancy.
AB  - Optimal antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy is controversial. We studied the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of 40 nonconsecutive infants less than 3 months of age in a double blind comparative trial. Infants were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or cefaclor in a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses for 10 days. Clinical responses and adverse drug effects were evaluated at 48 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. Pathogenic bacteria isolated from ear aspirates in 24 cases included Streptococcus pneumoniae (14), Haemophilus influenzae type b (5), H. influenzae nontypeable (3), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Branhamella sp. (2), and Streptococcus pyogenes (1). Nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included Streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and Streptococcus viridans. Two aspirates were sterile. A satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of 19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. We conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.
TI  - In vitro activity of teichomycin against isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of teichomycin has been evaluated against 189 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group D streptococci. Teichomycin was as active as vancomycin, a chemically related antibiotic, on staphylococci and inhibited the in vitro growth of methicillin-resistant strains at the same concentration necessary to inhibit the sensitive ones. Against group D streptococci teichomycin was about three times more active than vancomycin (MIC50 = 0.125 mg/l, MIC90 = 0.4 mg/l). MBC:MIC ratios of both drugs against staphylococci were comparable, but teichomycin had higher bactericidal activity against group D streptococci, as shown also by killing curves. The activity of teichomycin was not significantly affected by variation of pH, even if the maximum activity was achieved at neutral pH, or by different methods of MIC evaluation. The antibiotic seemed more active when tested with a low inoculum (10(3)-10(5)/ml): a two- to threefold increase in MIC was observed at an inoculum of 10(7)/ml. A reduction of the in vitro activity could be shown when Penassay broth was used as culture medium.
TI  - Conjugational transfer of gentamicin resistance plasmids intra- and interspecifically in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - We have previously reported the transfer of gentamicin resistance (Gmr) plasmids  in a mixed culture inter- and intraspecifically between strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated at Michael Reese Hospital (Jaffe et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 21:773-779, 1982). We have now shown that representatives of these plasmids were transferred between apparently nonlysogenic strains of S. aureus either in mixed culture in broth or by filter-mating on agar medium. The mechanism of transfer appeared to be conjugation. A transferable Gmr plasmid (pSH8) mobilized or cotransferred a tetracycline R-plasmid and a chloramphenicol R-plasmid that were not independently transferable. The transfer of Gmr plasmids was accompanied by a high incidence of deletion mutations with varied loss of plasmid resistance determinants and, with some mutants, loss of the ability to effect self-transfer. Restriction endonuclease digestion of pSH8 and its deletion mutants made it possible to assign the property of self-transfer to a specific segment of the pSH8 genome and provided the basis for a physical and genetic map of that plasmid. Similar Gmr plasmids from S. aureus strains isolated in locations remote from Michael Reese Hospital had resistance determinants and transfer properties comparable to those of pSH8. Our observations provide evidence for the conjugal transfer of some staphylococcal plasmids, apparently independent of the presence of phage. This mechanism may be of significance in the intra- and interspecific dissemination of resistance to aminoglycosides and other antibiotics in Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - Stimulation of migration of human monocytes by bacterial cell walls and muramyl peptides.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls, water-soluble fragments of the wall peptidoglycan, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP), and 6-O-acyl derivatives of MDP were examined for migration-stimulating activity on human peripheral blood monocytes by using a multiwell chemotaxis assembly. Cell walls isolated from 11 bacterial species caused a definite increase in monocyte migration, but the walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus were scarely active. The migration-enhancing activity of Staphylococcus epidermidis cell walls was retained by a monomer as well as a polymer of disaccharide peptides which were prepared by digestion of the peptidoglycan with enzymes. It was finally revealed that the migration of monocytes was enhanced by MDP. 6-O-Octadecanoyl-MDP, 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDP, and 6-O-(3-hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl)-N-acetylmuramyl-L-seryl-D-isoglutamine were active, but to a lesser extent. A checkerboard assay demonstrated that the increased monocyte migration caused by S. epidermidis cell walls was directed toward a positive stimulus (chemotaxis).
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Candida yeasts. Partial purification and characterization of the active substance of Candida guilliermondii.
AB  - The activity spectra of 25 Candida strains on strains of different species of bacteria were recorded. The active substance produced by Candida guilliermondii strain 848 was partially purified by cation exchange and chromatography gel filtration on Sephadex G-15. The substance is heat stable (80 degrees C, 10 min), not susceptible to treatment with proteases and most probably of a molecular weight smaller than 3500 Dalton. At a concentration of 50 A.U./ml it acts bacteriostatically on a Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (Fig. 1).
TI  - Detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. To determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. Each of six bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. Blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. Gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and MacConkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. However, subcultures onto Sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with P. aeruginosa). In a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with C. albicans and bacteremia with P. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of acute mastitis in a large dairy herd.
AB  - In a 270-cow dairy herd, milk samples from all cows with acute mastitis were cultured during a 12-month period. Of 119 isolates (from 166 quarters), 49% were gram-positive organisms, 39% were gram-negative organisms, and 12% were yeasts. Of all samples from cows with acute mastitis, 40% failed to produce colonies on culture media. Recovery of the common gram-positive pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus (11% of isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1% of isolations), was rather low. However, S epidermidis (14% of isolations) and streptococci other than Str agalactiae (9% of isolations) were recovered more frequently than expected, particularly in recently calved cows. Coliform organisms accounted for 35% of the total isolates and were the single most important cause of acute mastitis. Of 42 cows with coliform mastitis, 6 died despite intensive antibiotic and electrolyte therapy. There was no death loss among cows with mastitis caused by gram-positive organisms. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of 95 isolates to 11 antimicrobials was determined by standardized methods. Organisms were most often susceptible to chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and gentamicin. A treatment regimen consisting primarily of oxytetracycline and/or sulfonamides systemically in conjunction with intramammary infusions of cephapirin was evaluated. Treatment response in 37 quarters was determined by culturing before treatment and at 4 or more days after treatment. Of 23 quarters initially culture-positive, 22 were negative on reculture. Treatment response appeared to agree with the results of the susceptibility testing.
TI  - Bacterial endophthalmitis following cutting of sutures after cataract surgery.
AB  - Bacterial endophthalmitis developed in four patients after cataract surgery sutures were cut. Wound dehiscence was present in three cases, but in one the wound remained intact. Vitreous cultures identified Streptococcus viridans in two cases and Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis in one case each. Antibiotic therapy was administered by intraocular, periocular, topical and systemic routes and three patients underwent vitrectomy. Visual function recovered to 20/50 in two cases and to 20/100 in a third. Retinal detachment in the fourth case resulted in loss of all visual function.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime (HR-221).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefodizime (HR-221), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with the activities of selected antimicrobial agents against a broad spectrum of aerobic bacteria. Cefodizime concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml inhibited about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae studied. Serratia marcescens required 8 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of strains. Among gram-positive cocci, 50% of strains were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml of cefodizime (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefodizime. Cefotaxime, an antibiotic closely related to cefodizime structurally, was about fourfold more active.
TI  - In vitro activity of teichomycin A 2 in comparison with penicillin and vancomycin against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Teichomycin A2, a glycopeptide antibiotic from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, was  tested for its in vitro activity against 190 gram-positive cocci under variable test conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were fairly insensitive to both changes of inoculum size and pH, but were higher on agar than in broth. Teichomycin was about as active as vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin resistant and sensitive strains), slightly inferior to vancomycin against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and distinctly more active against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - [Mycologic and bacteriologic diagnosis of diaper dermatitis].
AB  
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Mode of action of the staphylococcin-like peptide Pep 5 and culture conditions effecting its activity.
AB  - Pep 5, a staphylococcin-like peptide produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 was bactericidal for staphylococci and micrococci (Fig. 1). A stable L-phase variant of Staphylococcus aureus, but not of Streptococcus faecalis, was susceptible, too, indicating that the selectivity of Pep 5 is not due to the presence of a cell wall receptor. Addition of Pep 5 to cultures of the indicator strain caused immediate inhibition of DNA, RNA, protein, and polysaccharide synthesis (Fig. 5). The action of Pep 5 could be inhibited by increasing the cation content of the medium (e.g., to 100 mM Mg2+ or 600 mM K+) (Fig. 3), indicating a primary binding to anionic sites on the cell wall. Sublethally injured cells could be rescued by the addition of trypsin or 1 M KCl (Fig. 4).
TI  - [Study of the spermatic bacterial flora in infertile males (author's transl)].
AB  - Two groups of infertile males (65 and 132 patients) have been investigated in two different laboratories, with two different methods to obtain semen. The bacteriological results are quite similar in the two groups. The microorganisms which have been isolated are : beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus, Epidermidis staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Corynebacter, Viridans streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Neisseria, Escherichia coli, anaerobic Staphylococcus, anaerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Corynebacter type IV. Fungus, Achromobacter, 20 p. cent of the patients are chronically infected without any clinical signs. This infection is probably of prostatic origin with an important number of bacteria in the semen (more than 3 000/ml). No relation has been shown between the bacteriological data and the physical and cytological characteristics of the sperm, except the pH : semens with a low pH are generally azoospermic and highly contaminated.
TI  - Effect of diving and diving hoods on the bacterial flora of the external ear canal and skin.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the external ear canals and posterior auricular skin surfaces were investigated in a group of 26 divers after 25 dry-suit dives in harbor water and 20 dry-suit dives in clear test tank test. A control group of 16 divers wore rubber hoods 19 times for a similar period (25 to 30 min) but did not dive. The protective effect of 2% acetic acid was tested by instilling it in the left ear of 14 divers and 8 nondivers. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and enteric gram-negative rods were the predominant isolates from skin and ear samples. After the divers dove or after they wore hoods without going in the water, there was a substantial increase in the number of these organisms on the skin (46.9%) or in the external ears (43.8%) of the divers. However, an increase in the bacterial counts in the external ear canals occurred in only 13.6% of the individuals treated prophylactically with acetic acid drops. Although no gram-negative rods were recovered from the skin or external ear canals of divers in clear tank water, 23 strains were isolated after the dives in harbor water. Identical gram-negative isolates also were recovered from the harbor water. Gram-negative organisms also were recovered from three newly acquired skin lacerations, where they persisted for at least 24 h. Our data show the acquisition of gram-negative rods when dives were made in polluted water. The data also demonstrate the increase in bacterial counts that occurs when rubber diving rods are worn (in or out of water) and that this increase can be controlled by pretreatment of ears with acetic acid.
TI  - Experimental otitis media in gerbils and chinchillas with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - To ascertain the usefulness of Mongolian gerbils as an inbred model for otitis media, 52 Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus, strain MONT/Tum) were compared with 26 chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) for susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3. Haemophilus influenzae type b, and a polymicrobic culture including anaerobes (Streptococcus intermedius, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium sp.). Organisms were inoculated percutaneously into the superior chamber of the middle ear bulla. The gerbils and chinchillas shared similar susceptibilities and responses to the inoculated organisms as determined by X-ray, otoscopic, histopathological, and microbiological determinations at 5 to 7 days. Koch's postulate studies proved the role of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the pathology found in both animal models. The animals were also susceptible to the polymicrobic culture, although the relative virulence of the individual members of this mixture was low, suggesting that these species potentiated as a polymicrobic mixture. The Corynebacterium sp. appeared to elicit the greatest histopathological response in chronic (8-week) studies in gerbils. The gerbils were found to be useful as an alternative animal model for the study of otitis media of bacterial etiology.
TI  - Studies on bacterial hypersensitivity in man. Interrelationship between skin reactions to bacterial peptidoglycan and serum peptidoglycan antibody titers.
AB  - The nature and extent of bacterially induced allergies are difficult to define. Since peptidoglycan, the main component of the cell wall of almost all bacteria, has been available in a highly purified, chemically and immunologically well-defined form, investigation of the allergological significance of this cell component is feasible. Intracutaneous tests were carried out on 181 test subjects with five different peptidoglycan (PG) preparations from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus Pyogenes. The results of the investigation were compared with the result of determination of serum PG antibodies and serum IgE concentrations. It was shown that test subjects with dual and later reactions to three different staphylococcal PGs displayed significantly higher PG antibody titers than test subjects with negative reactions. Such a relationship could not be found with the cutaneous reactions to streptococcal PG. The total serum IgE values were very much higher in test subjects with immediate reactions to staphylococcal PG than in test subjects with a negative reaction. Typical Arthus reaction or late granulomatous reactions were not observed. Humoral antibodies are involved at least in part in the elicitation of dual and late reactions. Thus, there are interesting parallels to allergy to fungal spores and organic dusts.
TI  - Blood culture cross contamination associated with a radiometric analyzer.
AB  - During a 9-day period in August 1980 in a New Jersey hospital, three pairs of consecutively numbered blood cultures from different patients were identified as positive for the same organism (two pairs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of group A Streptococcus), for each pair, both cultures were positive in the same atmosphere, both organisms had the same sensitivities, and the second of each pair grew at least 2 days after the first and was the only positive blood culture obtained from the patient. When the hospital laboratory discontinued use of its radiometric culture analyzer for 15 days, no more consecutive pairs of positive cultures occurred. Subsequent use of the machine for 9 days with a new power unit but the original circuit boards resulted in one more similar consecutive pair (Staphylococcus epidermidis). After replacement of the entire power unit, there were no further such pairs. Examination of the machine by the manufacturer revealed a defective circuit board which resulted in inadequate needle sterilization. Laboratories which utilize radiometric analyzers should be aware of the potential for cross contamination. Recognition of such events requires alert microbiologists and infection control practitioners and a record system in the bacteriology laboratory designed to identify such clusters.
TI  - The bacteriology and cytology of chronic otitis media with effusion.
AB  - The bacteriology and cytology of middle ear effusion from 729 children with persistent otitis media with effusion were studied. Thirty-five percent of these chronic effusions were culture-positive. Type b and non-type b Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant isolates. Serous and mucoid effusion cultures yielded bacteria more often in younger than in older children. In addition bacteria were seen in 17% of the Gram-stained smears of the sterile effusions; Gram-positive cocci predominated in these effusions. Disparate effusion culture results were obtained in 32% of bilateral otitis media cases. Effusions which yielded H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae on culture had more polymorphonuclear leukocytes than did effusions which yielded S. epidermidis or Neisseria or were sterile. Phagocytic cells were equally prevalent in sterile effusions with or without bacteria on Gram stain. Phagocytic cells were seen less often in mucoid effusions from antibiotic-treated patients than in mucoid effusions from untreated patients. The results suggest that certain bacteria in chronic middle ear effusion contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition by eliciting a local inflammatory cell response.
TI  - Long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - Thirteen women and two preadolescent girls who suffered recurrences after six months of prophylaxis with trimethoprim (TMP; 40 mg) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ; 200 mg) taken thrice weekly at bedtime were enrolled in a 24-month study of prophylaxis with the same region. During 29.1 cumulative patient-years of prophylaxis, two infections due to Escherichia coli and one each due to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis occurred (0.14 infection/patient-year). MICs for these isolates were less than or equal to 2 micrograms of TMP/ml and greater than 512 micrograms of SMZ/ml. During prophylaxis, 106 of 116 cultures from the periurethral area and 66 of 97 cultures from the anal and canal yielded no aerobic gram-negative bacilli. In three patients, the periurethral area was colonized with aerobic gram-negative bacilli with MICs of greater than or equal to 2 micrograms of TMP/ml. Thirteen patients were followed after the discontinuation of prophylaxis. Eight suffered recurrences, seven with organisms susceptible to TMP. After one year the remaining five had experienced no recurrences. It is concluded that long-term prophylaxis with 40 mg of TMP and 200 mg of SMZ thrice weekly is an effective, well-tolerated regimen that can maintain an infection-free state in women with histories of frequent urinary reinfections.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Contractile effects of bacterial cell walls, their enzymatic digests, and muramyl dipeptides on ileal strips from guinea pigs.
AB  - Cell walls isolated from four bacterial species (Streptococcus pyogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptomyces gardneri, and Nocardia corynebacteriodes), which exhibited the adjuvant effect of stimulating cellular and humoral immune responses against ovalbumin in guinea pigs, caused the slow-starting and long-lasting contraction of guinea pig ileal strips suspended in Tyrode solution. In contrast to these cell walls active in immunoadjuvancy, those isolated from five bacterial species (Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Arthrobacter atrocyaneus, Corynebacterium insidiosum, and Ampullariella regularis), which lacked immunoadjuvancy at least in intact walls, caused no or very weak contraction of the ileal strips. Further study demonstrated that both a monomer and a polymer of disaccharide-stem peptides, which were obtained by enzymatic degradation of S. epidermis cell wall peptidoglycans, displayed similar contractile effects. It was finally revealed that guinea pig ileum strips showed a definite contractile response to N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) and 6-O-stearoyl- and 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDPs, but not to their analogs, whose C-terminal amino acid was L-isoglutamine or D-isoasparagine in place of D-isoglutamine and which lacked adjuvancy. 6-O-(3-Hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl)-MDP, on the other hand, caused a slow and lasting relaxation of the ileum strips, but its L-isoglutamine and D-isoasparagine analogs did not.
TI  - [Study of the spermatic bacterial flora in infertile males (author's transl)].
AB  - Two groups of infertile males (65 and 132 patients) have been investigated in two different laboratories, with two different methods to obtain semen. The bacteriological results are quite similar in the two groups. The microorganisms which have been isolated are : beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus, Epidermidis staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Corynebacter, Viridans streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Neisseria, Escherichia coli, anaerobic Staphylococcus, anaerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Corynebacter type IV, Fungus, Achromobacter. 20 p. cent of the patients are chronically infected without any clinical signs. This infection is probably of prostatic origin with an important number of bacteria in the semen (more than 3,000/ml). No relation has been shown between the bacteriological data and the physical and cytological characteristics of the sperm, except the pH : semens with a low pH are generally azoospermic and highly contaminated.
TI  - Biophotometric comparison of cephalexin and cephradine against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have compared the antibacterial activities of cephalexin and cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (Micrococcus spp. type III), and group B streptococci (35 strains in total), using the Biophotometer. Analysis of growth curves obtained in the presence of various concentrations of the antibiotics revealed little difference between the activities of the two cephalosporins. However, both antibiotics showed maximal activity at 8-16 microgram/ml, and increasing the concentration past this point resulted in a reduced antibacterial effect. Unlike the other species tested, streptococci were not lysed by cephalexin or cephradine.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Candidiasis in children with diaper rash. Study of 140 cases].
AB  - The frequency of genito-crural candidiasis in infants presenting diaper rash, as  well as the possible influence of bacterial flora in this region on the pathogenicity of Candida was studied. Skin scraping were made with sterile swabs and processed by bacteriological and mycological methods in 140 children whose ages ranged between 0 and 20 months. The most commonly found microbiological flora were Candida spp (65.7%), non hemolytic Streptococcus (18.5%), Staphylococus epidermidis (19.2%); beta hemolytic Streptococcus (12.8%) and alfa-hemolytic Streptococcus (9.2%). Of the 140 cases, 76 (54.3%) showed candidiasis associated with diaper rash and 16 (11.4%) had Candida as normal flora. C. albicans was most frequently found (66.3%) followed by C. tropicalis (19.6%). Candidiasis was more frequent in those infants that had no other associated of pathogenic flora. Factors significantly influencing the increase in the frequency of candidiasis were: A) Evolution time, which was directly proportional; B) Use of cotton diapers covered with plastic pants; C) Feeding with cow's as opposed to maternal milk; and D) Malnutrition associated with poor hygiene.
TI  - 9-epi-leucomycin A5. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - 9-epi-Leucomycin A5 has been obtained from leucomycin A5 (I) by the following reaction sequence. Leucomycin A5 (I) was treated with Collins reagent (CrO3-pyridine) in the presence of water (13%) to provide 9-dehydroleucomycin A5 (II) in 95% yield. The formyl group was internally protected by the reaction of II with acetic anhydride-K2CO3 to afford 18,2'-di-O-acetyl-9-dehydroleucomycin A5-3,18-hemiacetal (III). Sodium borohydride reaction of II provided a 1 : 1 mixture of natural I and its 9-epimer, 9-epi-leucomycin A5 (IV), which were separated by silica gel chromatography. It was observed that the antimicrobial activities of both enantiomers were virtually identical with some tests strains but that of IV is reduced in comparison with I in some bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis sp-al-1 and Streptococcus pyogenes N. Y. 5.
TI  - [Hygienic and microbiological influences exerted on natural water biotopes by algae and the growth of water plants. 1. Communication: antibacterial properties of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. Subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators E. coli (faecal indicator), Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), Enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), Staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and Bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). It was found that --Hydrodictyon reticulatum and Aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while Chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. With respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. Therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.
TI  - Lack of requirement for blind subcultures of BACTEC blood culture media.
AB  - To determine the need for blind subculturing of BACTEC (Johnston Laboratories, Cockeysville, Md.) blood culture media, we compared results of radiometric readings, visual inspection, and blind subculturing for nearly 7,500 blood specimens. Visual inspection and radiometric testing were performed on day 1 through 7, and blind subcultures were made on day 3. In the first phase of the study, 402 of 3,896 aerobic bottles were positive by radiometric testing (growth index, greater than 25), visual inspection, or subculturing. Only six bottles were radiometrically negative but subculture positive on day 3. The second phase of the study was designed to determine if aerobic bottles eventually became radiometrically positive in those cases in which they were radiometrically negative but subculture positive on day 3. Two bottles were subculture positive but never gave a growth index of greater than or equal to 25 by day 7. One yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis, and one yielded viridans, Streptococcus sp. A total of 35 anaerobic organisms were isolated from 3,896 blood specimens. All of these anaerobes were detected by both radiometric testing and subculturing. We examined a total of 14,972 blood culture bottles. Twenty-nine bottles considered negative by visual inspection or radiometric readings were found to be positive by subculturing. Fifteen of these were shown, by chart review, to contain contaminants. Organisms in the other negative bottles would not have gone undetected because companion bottles from the same patients were radiometrically or visually positive. We concluded that it is necessary to perform blind subcultures of BACTEC 7B and 8B blood culture bottles.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Changing blood culture isolates in a referral neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - An analysis was made of all cases of bacteraemia that had occurred in the referral neonatal intensive care unit at Hammersmith Hospital during the years 1976--79. One hundred and thirteen infants had positive blood cultures; 27 were born in the hospital, and 86 admitted from elsewhere. This gave a rate of 5.7/1000 live hospital births, and 165/1000 outborn admissions to the unit. The latter infants were predominantly of very low birthweight or were ill. Thirty-three of the isolates were cultured in the first 48 hours of life (early) and the remaining 80 after that time (later). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the organism most often isolated both early and later. These results were different from those recorded in the previous 9 years (1967--75) from the same unit. Then, group B beta-haemolytic streptococcus was the organism most often isolated early, while Gram-negative bacteria predominated among later isolates. The changing nature of care may contribute to these findings.
TI  - [Causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.
TI  - Bacteriologic study of sow agalactia.
AB  - Necropsy of 13 agalactic and 11 normally lactating sows at 1 to 2 days after parturition revealed that 7 of the agalactic and 4 of the clinically normal sows had lesions of mastitis. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus equisimilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the predominant organisms isolated. The organisms were isolated as pure and as mixed cultures and all 3 were isolated from normal appearing, as well as mastitic, glands. Pure culture isolation of E. coli (44 gland segments) was significantly associated with microscopic lesions of mastitis, regardless of the number of colonies isolated, whereas pure culture isolation of Streptococcus equisimilis or S epidermidis in low to moderate numbers was not. Isolation of large numbers of beta-hemolytic streptococci (2 gland segments) or of S epidermidis (6 gland segments) was associated with microscopic evidence of mastitis. Cultural examination of uterus and cervix revealed 5 isolates of strict anaerobic bacteria, all different species, from 4 of the 24 sows. Culture of 2 mammary glands from each sow revealed no strict anaerobes. Phase-contrast microscopic examination of specimens from mammary glands, uterus, and cervix of each sow revealed no spirochetes. Attempts to isolate mycoplasmas and chlamydiae from mammary gland, uterine tube (fallopian tube), uterus, cervix, and urethra of the 24 sows were negative. The evidence confirms previous reports that coliforms are the most significant bacteria in mastitis of the sow.
TI  - Mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  - A medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. Mannitol agar supported growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except Corynebacterium pyogenes. Color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. Most Staphylococcus aureus strains and some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. These yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from quarters with significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. Mannitol-negative strains of S epidermidis (those with red zones) were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters. The streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: Streptococcus agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, and group G streptococci produced red zones; Str uberis, Str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. Pathogenic streptococci (Str agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, Str uberis, and group G streptococci) were obtained from quarters with SCC significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. Pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - Premature labor. II. Bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  - Human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase A2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. The striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase A2 activity. Activity was found in Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus A and B, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pneumococcus, Lactobacillus, and Mycoplasma hominis. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and S viridans had the highest activities. The specific activities of phospholipase A2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase A2 of the amnion and chorion. We postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase A2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.
TI  - Heparin inhibits phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Phagocytosis of unopsonized Salmonella typhimurium 395, MR-10, opsonized Salmonella typhimurium 395 MS, and Staphylococcus epidermidis by rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes was inhibited by heparin at concentrations as low as 0.5 U/ml. Inhibition was dose dependent and nearly complete at 20 U/ml. Provided that heparin concentrations did not exceed 100 U/ml, inhibition could be largely reversed by washing. Heparin also reversibly inhibited the adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to glass. In contrast, hexose monophosphate shunt activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by noningested S. typhimurium MR-10 or Streptococcus pyogenes B14 was not inhibited by heparin at concentrations as high as 100 U/ml.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Microbiological studies of the bacterial flora of the external auditory canal in  children.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the external auditory canal (EAC) was studied in 72 children. Aerobes only were isolated in 58 patients (80%) and anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (3%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered in 12 cases (17%). There were 122 aerobic and 15 anaerobic isolates accounting for 1.7 aerobes and 0.2 anaerobes per specimen. The most common aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (56 isolates), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (13) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8). The two anaerobic organisms recovered were Proprionibacterium acnes (13 isolates) and Peptococcus sp. (2). These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacterial flora of EAC in children where aerobic facultative and anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora.
TI  - Sexually transmitted conditions among women college students.
AB  - We studied 500 unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. Most participants were symptom-free and had normal physical examinations. Few sexually transmitted infections were encountered. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was recovered from two and Trichomonas vaginalis was obtained from 14 of 500 women. Chlamydia trachomatis was recovered from 20 (4.6%) of 439 participants. Genital warts, genital herpes, and molluscum contagiosum, respectively, were noted in seven, four, and one of the 500 participants. There was no cases of syphilis, scabies, or pediculosis pubis. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, respectively, were recovered from 17.6 and 56.8% of the subjects. Prevalent vaginal bacteria included lactobacilli, streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal specimens of about one third of the participants.
TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.
TI  - Bacteriologic investigation and histologic observations of variably acid-fast bacteria in three cases of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.
AB  - Skin biopsy specimens from 3 consecutive patients with lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma limited to the skin were cultured for bacteria, and also examined histopathologically for the presence of acid-fast wall deficient (CWD) bacteria. Corynebacterium sp and Propionibacterium acnes were isolated from two repeated cultures from the first case. Both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus viridans were isolated from the second case. Bacteriologic culture of the third case was negative. Utilizing the Intensified Kinyoun stain for the detection of acid-fast CWD bacteria, variably acid-fast coccoid forms were visualized in the tissue sections from two cases. In one case, the Gram strain revealed similar forms. Newer knowledge linking CWD bacterial forms of staphylococci, streptococci, and corynebacteria-like microbes to cryptic infection of human blood is discussed, as well as the possible role of CWD bacteria in the pathogenesis of malignancy. This study suggests that CWD microbes might play a role in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, and that the presence of microbes might be detected by bacteriologic culture of KS lesions, and acid-fast histologic staining of skin biopsy specimens.
TI  - Observations on the growth of urethral and vaginal bacteria in sterile urine.
AB  - Voided, midstream urine specimens from 127 patients and volunteers with sterile bladder urine were incubated for 24 hours to measure the presence or absence of inhibitory activity in urine to small numbers (100 or less bacteria per milliliter) of contaminating Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella), enterococci and several species of the normal perineal flora. Virtually no inhibitory activity was found for Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis when measured by substantial growth at 24 hours. Of the 32 patients with 100 or less Enterobacteriaceae per milliliter urine before incubation, 30 urine specimens had growth of 10(5) bacteria per milliliter or more of the same organism; 9 of 30 specimens began growth at less than 10 Enterobacteriaceae per milliliter urine. The 39 urine specimens containing 10(4) or more enterococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis after 24 hours of incubation began with original inocula of 100 bacteria per milliliter or less; 28 of 39 began growth at less than 10 bacteria per milliliter. Growth rates of pure strains inoculated into sterile, filtered urine (strains derived from from the same individual as the urine in which they were inoculated) showed significant differences in bacterial growth at 4 to 6 hours after incuation; Escherichia coli and enterococci generated 10 to 100 times more colonies than strains from the normal perineal flora (lactobacilli, corynebacteria and so forth). We conclude that normal urine is non-inhibitory to small inocula of Enterobacteriacea and enterococci but that it is not as conducive to growth for some of the indigent, resident flora, perhaps explaining the relative infrequency of urinary infections owing to normal, perineal bacteria.
TI  - Use of a teat sealer for prevention of intramammary infections in lactating cows.
AB  - An acrylic latex film that is applied like a teat dip and remains intact as a physical barrier until the next milking was developed and studied with respect to its effect on intramammary infection rates in 4 dairy herds. Rates of new infections in treated quarters were compared with the rates in control quarters on the same cows. A statistically significant reduction in the rates was observed for the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, 28%; S epidermidis, 33%; and coliforms, 76%. The percentage reduction for infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (18%) and for those caused by streptococcus other than Str agalactiae (7%) were not statistically significant. The film also was shown to be nonirritating.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative methods of studying the effect of lipids on bacteria grown on the surface of solid culture media.
AB  - New qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. The methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. Oleic and linoleic acids inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes markedly, Staphylococcus aureus and Staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inhibition of growth of a strain of Str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. Linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. The methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - ["Staphylococcus saprophyticus": a little known Staphylococcus (author's transl)].
AB  - Enzymatic patterns, antibiotic sensitivity, penicillinase, production, mercury ion resistance have been studied in St. saprophyticus strains in comparison with St. epidermidis, both isolate from urinary infections of hospital patients. The St. saprophyticus has shown to have a lower number of virulence factors, to be more sensitive to antibiotics and to have a lower potential epidemiological value.
TI  - Antibody coated bacteria in otitis media with effusions.
AB  - The significance of bacterial isolates of coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium species in middle ear fluids remains controversial. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible role of these organisms in different effusions. Cultures were obtained from the external cartilaginous ear, bony canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear fluids, tonsils and nasopharynx of 93 patients at the time of myringotomy for otitis media with effusion. Isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the middle ear, external ear and posterior aural skin were evaluated in regard to antibiotic sensitivity, biochemical tests and phage typing. Furthermore, in another series of patients in whom these organisms were isolated, specific antibody activity in both middle ear washings and corresponding sera were measured, using the technique of indirect immunofluorescence. The results suggest that the isolates from the middle ear and ear canal are not always identical. There is some evidence that specific IgM and IgG as well as IgA responses to these organisms are present in middle ear washings and not in corresponding serum. These results suggest that coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species in middle ear effusions may not be contaminants from the external canal and that a local immune response may be produced by these organisms. Whether or not these organisms represent etiologic agents responsible for otitis media with effusion cannot be ascertained from this data. One very interesting point is the presence of IgF coating of organisms in some effusions.
TI  - Treatment failures secondary to in vivo development of drug resistance by microorganisms.
AB  - In two patients development of resistance to antibiotics by initially sensitive infecting organisms was associated with relapse or persistence of active infection. The first patient developed Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to chloramphenicol during therapy with this agent for an infection that followed a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, and the second patient developed bacteremia due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella during therapy with ampicillin. Treatment failure resulting from in vivo development of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been described for most of the major classes of antiinfective drugs and for numerous microorganisms. Although in many of these instances reinfection with a resistant organism cannot be excluded, there are many examples of apparent mutation or initial infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial populations that is followed by selective multiplication of the resistant population or acquisition of resistance by an initially sensitive infecting organism. This phenomenon can be a cause of treatment failure and has appeared in patients in whom, by available tests, drug levels were found adequate. Isolation days after the institution of antimicrobial therapy of what appears to be the same organism as was initially recovered should prompt repeated sensitivity tests, at least to the agents being administered, if the patient's clinical course has not been one of satisfactory improvement.
TI  - Trimethoprim resistance in Finland after five years' use of plain trimethoprim.
AB  - A total of 1388 urinary bacterial pathogens were tested for resistance to plain trimethoprim after five years' use of this drug for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. Samples were obtained in Turku, Finland, where use of the drug is much greater than in other parts of Finland. Resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l; agar-dilution method) occurred in 20.3% of strains isolated from outpatients and 39.8% of strains isolated from inpatients. Escherichia coli and Micrococcus showed low incidences of resistance (11% and 13% respectively in ouptatients and 23% and 19% respectively in inpatients); Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis occupied an intermediate position; and Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella were resistant in 41-76% of cases. Similar incidences of resistance were observed to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. These findings together with the rare occurrence of side effects and convenient dosage confirm the usefulness of plain trimethoprim for urinary tract infection.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Drug resistance of organisms isolated from feces of laboratory mice and rats.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of EScherichia coli, 132 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 137 of Streptococcus faecalis and 89 of STr. faecium were collected from feces of 40 mice and 36 rats of 8 colonies in 1978, and drug resistance were examined by an agar dieution method using 23 antibiotics. The results indicated a positive relation between use of antibiotics and appearance of multiple drug resistant organisms.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.
TI  - [Bacterial antagonism of oral secretions towards staphylococci].
AB  - Bacterial antagonism may be one of the mechanism which regulates the bacterial flora of the pharynx. We have investigated the bacterial antagonism exerted in oral secretion by alpha-hemolytic streptococci against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. We cultured viridans streptococci and staphylococci in human saliva and we noted a bactericidal activity towards staphylococci. Such activity, referable to the salivary system (peroxidase-thiocyanate) activated by hydrogen peroxide produced by streptococci, was greater on S. epidermidis. The remarkable sensitivity of S. epidermidis could explain the rare presence of this species in pharynx and oral cavity.
TI  - Enhancement of generation of monocyte tissue thromboplastin by bacterial phagocytosis: possible pathway for fibrin formation on infected vegetations in bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - The deposition of fibrin on infected vegetations and the presence of mononuclear  phagocytes that have phagocytized bacteria are remarkabe features in experimental bacterial endocarditis. In a study in vitro, we show that phagocytosis of bacteria by human monocytes enhances thromboplastin generation by these cells. Maximal enhancement of the generation of thromboplastin by monocytes was about six times compared with that in the control experiment without bacteria, and it was obtained by preincubation of the monocytes with 5 to 10 bacteria per monocyte. No quantitative difference was observed between Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sanguis as to the enhancement of the monocyte thromboplastin generation. An enhancement of the procoagulant activity generation was also observed after addition of bacteria to human or rabbit whole blood. Probably, this generation was also due to synthesis of thromboplastin by monocytes. It is conceivable that fibrin deposition on infected vegetations during bacterial endocarditis is mediated by thromboplastin synthesis by monocytes.
TI  - Specific absorption of human serum albumin, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin  G with selected strains of group A and G streptococci.
AB  - Five gram-positive bacterial strains were selected for absorption studies of human serum samples. Strain AR1 (group A, M-type 1) and G148 (group G), with strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding capacities, and strain AW43 (group A, M-type 60), binding both IgA1 and IgA2, were compared with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and with Staphylococcus epidermidis L603. Both AR1 and G148 were capable of completely absorbing out serum IgG. In contrast, S. aureus Cowan I left a fraction unabsorbed, as expected from its known lack of IgG3 binding. Strain AW43 absorbed out all serum IgA, using a 10-microliter bacterial pellet for 20 microliter of serum. Serum IgM levels were slightly reduced by S. aureus Cowan I absorption. On the basis of the experiments, a bacterial mixture was designed consisting of S. aureus Cowan I and group A streptococcus strains AR1 and AW43, with absorption characteristics suitable for use in discriminating between early IgM and late IgG and IgA immune responses in routine serological work. A new type of bacteria-mammalian protein binding was discovered. Human serum albumin was completely absorbed out by strain G148 and to a lesser extent by strain AR1 and AW43. S. aureus Cowan I and S. epidermidis were negative. The binding capacity of G148 for albumin equalled that of Cowan I for IgG. The binding pattern of albumin to the strains was different from those of IgG, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, or aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and therefore seems to represent another type of bacterial-mammalian interaction with a specific albumin receptor on the surface of streptococci.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - The microbiology of serous and mucoid otitis media.
AB  - One hundred forty-four serous and mucoid effusions were cultured for aerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and virus. Thirty percent of all effusions yielded an unequivocally positive culture for aerobic bacteria. Although serous effusions were culture positive as often as mucoid effusions, Haemophilus influenzae was isolated predominantly from serous effusions and Staphylococcus epidermidis predominantly from mucoid samples. Only one of 73 effusions yielded a viral isolate (Herpesvirus hominis). None of 33 effusions yielded M pneumoniae, and only one of 17 effusions yielded an anaerobe (Propionibacterium). These findings suggest that aerobic bacteria may play a role in the pathogensis of serous and mucoid otitis media.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Adjuvant activities in production of reaginic antibody by bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan or synthetic N-acetylmuramyl dipeptides in mice.
AB  - This paper is concerned with the adjuvant activity in stimulatory immunoglobulin  E production against ovalbumin (OA) by bacterial cell walls, cell wall peptidoglycan (PG), and their PG fragments and synthetic N-acetylmuramyl (MurNAc) dipeptides in A/J mice. A PG isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, PG subunit polymer and dimer obtained from Staphylococcus epidermidis, and water-soluble fragments of cell walls or PG prepared from Nocardia corynebacteriodes and Streptomyces gardneri were found to enhance both the primary and secondary responses of anti-OA immunoglobulin E antibody production. It was suggested that the PG portion, either intact or highly degraded, was capable of enhancing the immunoglobulin E antibody production, and there was no need for the non-PG moiety or intactness of PG structure for the adjuvant activity. This finding was confirmed and extended by the use of synthetic MurNAc dipeptides. Among eight MurNAc dipeptides tested, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Gln, MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, and MurNAc-l-Ser-d-isoGln were found active as an adjuvant in the stimulation of the primary and secondary reaginic anti-OA antibody production in a similar way to the cell wall PG and their fragments. None of the synthetic MurNAc-l-Ala-l-isoGln, MurNAc-l-Ala-l-Gln, MurNAc-l-Ala-l-Glu, and MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoAsn, on the other hand, stimulated the anti-OA immunoglobulin E antibody production in either primary or secondary response, indicating the importance for the adjuvancy in immunoglobulin E production of the configuration of the glutamic acid residues adjacent to the l-Ala (or l-Ser) in muramyl dipeptides.
TI  - Protection of mice against Babesia microti with cord factor, COAM, zymosan, glucan, Salmonella and Listeria.
AB  - Cord factor (trehalose 6-6' dimycolate). COAM (chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose), zymosan, glucan, Salmonella enteritidis 11RX and Listeria monocytogenes were found to protect mice against subsequent infection with Babesia microti, an intra-erythrocytic protozoan parasite. This protection was not observed after injection of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a viridans group Streptococcus, thioglycollate, or colloidal carbon. All the agents which protect against B. microti have also been reported to induce non-specific protection against experimental tumours. The parasites appear to die inside circulating red cells. This implies that these can exert non-specific protection against this parasite through the mediation of a soluble factor.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Absence of bacterial adherence in the establishment of experimental mastitis in mice.
AB  - The possibility of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae to the epithelium of the mammary gland was investigated by inoculating them into this gland of mice. S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli did not adhere to alveolar epithelium in suckling or non-suckling mice. S. agalactiae adhered to alveolar epithelium in non-suckling mice but adhesion was not sufficiently strong to withstand suckling. Bacterial adherence probably does not play a significant role in the establishment of mastitis by these organisms.
TI  - Quantitative studies on competitive activities of skin bacteria growing on solid  media.
AB  - Earlier quantitative investigations of antagonism between skin bacteria were based on the use of liquid cultures, but a more realistic model has now been devised, based on the use of the surfaces of solid media. Pure or mixed inocula were spread evenly over suitable agar media in Petri dishes marked out with a standard grid. Growth curves were constructed from viable counts of the surface bacteria after they had been removed from excised squares of the agar media and dispersed. The method was highly reproducible, and competitive interactions were revealed more clearly than in studies with liquid media. An antibiotic-producing strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (S6+) readily suppressed strains of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium and Streptococcus species. However, a Staphylococcus aureus strain which was less sensitive to the antibiotic effect of S6+ interacted in a complex manner, depending on the absolute and relative size of the S6+ inoculum.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Anaerobic microflora of the vagina in children.
AB  - Vaginal cultures from 25 healthy girls from two months to 15 years of age were examined for aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria. An average of 8.7 species (3.7 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic species; 5.3 obligately anaerobic species) were isolated from these cultures. Staphylococcus epidermidis (21), diphtheroids (20), bacteroides (19), peptococci (19), peptostreptococci (14), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14) were most prevalent organisms.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic cervical flora of healthy Thai women.
AB  - The bacteriologic study of the cervical flora in 50 healthy women revealed that 70% harbored mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 15 women (30%). Polymicrobial organisms were found in all but five women (in these only one aerobe was isolated per patient). The majority of patients had 1-2 anaerobes, with more than two aerobes. The common aerobes were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis and lactobacilli. The most common anaerobes were Peptococcus asaccharolyticus isolated in 21 women (42%), P prevotii in 13 (26%) and Bacteroides in 10 (20%). These organisms are frequently found in pelvic infection, suggesting the pathogenic potential of the normal flora of the cervix.
TI  - Immunohistochemical localization of a choriogonadotropin-like protein in bacteria isolated from cancer patients.
AB  - By the use of specific antibody to human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) as well as to its beta-subunit, and the application of the indirect fluorescein-labeled and peroxidase-labeled antibody techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of a membrane (wall)-associated CG-similar immunoreactive protein in 15 strains of bacteria isolated from tissues of patients bearing malignant neoplasms. These microorganisms were classified as S. epidermidis, (12) E. coli (2), and a single strain of P. maltophilia (ATCC 13637). The absence of the CG-like antigen in other "cancer associated bacteria", Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 12818) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from patient with cancer of colon), demonstrated that not every "cancer associated bacteria" has the capability to synthesize the trophoblastic-like protein. The negative results obtained with a number of "noncancer control" bacteria of known origin, obtained from ATCC and from clinical samples, strongly supported the idea that the existance of these CG-like protein producing microorganisms is not a ubiquitous finding. The demonstration of a de novo bacterial biosynthesis of a protein having similar antigenic and biophysical properties to those of the human trophoblastic hormone, has great biological implications, especially if its biosynthesis is proven only in bacterial strains growing in the presence of cancer cells in which we have already demonstrated the presence of a similar antigen. The explanation of the phenomenon is unknown. Because of their origin, the potential of "genetic exchange" with subsequent expression of the mammalian gene by the bacterial cells becomes a possibility. It is also possible that the gene coding for the CG-like protein is normally present but inactive or repressed in all bacteria.
TI  - The effect of subclinical Staphylococcus epidermidis infection of the lactating bovine udder on its susceptibility to infection with Streptococcus agalactiae or Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of five nitrofurans.
AB  - Five nitrofurans- nitrofurantoin, nifuratel, nitrofurazone, furazolidone and and  SQ 18,506--have been tested against 201 microbial strains. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, micrococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis were sensitive to all five compounds; furazolidone and SQ 18,506 were the most active against these species. Klebsiella aerogenes was less sensitive, and Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant. Nifuratel was inhibitory for some Candida albicans strains, and SQ 18,506 was highly active against this species. Nifuratel was judged overall to have superior in vitro antimicrobial properties to nitrofurantoin.
TI  - Survey of conjunctival flora in dogs with clinical signs of external eye disease.
AB  - Bacteria were isolated 68% of the time from the conjunctival sacs of 120 dogs with conjunctivitis, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, or corneal ulcerations. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated organism (68%); when both eyes were affected, S aureus was recovered from 29% of the dogs; and in dogs with 1 eye affected, S aureus was isolated from 23% of the affected eyes and in 18% of the nonaffected eyes. Other organisms recovered from eyes were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis (27%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (19%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (17%), Escherichia coli (10%), Bacillus spp (11%), and Proteus spp (7%). It was concluded that S aureus may appear as a primary pathogen in ocular disease. When 1 eye is clinically affected, S aureus can be a potential invader of the normal eye.
TI  - Iron requirement and chelator production of staphylococci, Streptococcus faecalis and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The effect of iron deprivation on growth of 101 aerobic strains of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria was studied on agar media in the presence of various concentrations of the synthetic iron chelator ethylene diamine diorthohydroxyphenyl acetic acid (EDDA) and the iron binding protein transferrin. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited by 15 mM EDDA and 1.5 mM transferrin. Staphylococcus aureus was only inhibited by 44 mM EDDA and not by transferrin. None of the strains of S. faecalis was inhibited. The majority of the enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Salmonella spp, Klebsiella spp) was inhibited by 44 mM EDDA and 1.5 mM transferrin. The relation between susceptibility and concentration of EDDA and transferrin was expressed as S-value for each species. Iron supply with various iron compounds could restore the effects of inhibition. In all species except in S. faecalis iron chelator production could be demonstrated, using indicator plates of media containing EDDA and flooded with 10(4)--10(5) colony forming units of indicator organisms. The iron chelator of both S. epidermidis and S. aureus could stimulate growth of S. epidermidis, but not that of enterobacteriaceae. Iron chelators from all gram-negative bacteria were functionally interchangeable, but did not stimulate growth of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial stimulation and granulocyte inhibition of granulopoietic factor production.
AB  - We attempted to determine the effect of live bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis) on granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (monocytes and lymphocytes) in vitro. Addition of bacteria to mononuclear-cell cultures enhanced colony-stimulating-factor production by these cells, as assayed on both human and mouse bone marrow. Addition of peripheral blood granulocytes to parallel cultures eliminated this enhancement effect, presumably by bacterial removal or inactivation. These data suggest that micro-organisms may have a pivotal role in granulocyte production and maturation by serving as a stimulus to increase colony-stimulating-factor production and also as negative control through their removal by the newly formed granulocytes.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  - Inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis. Lipid secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. This novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: S. sanguis (group H), S. pyogenes (group A), And S. pneumoniae. The secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating with resumption of culture growth. All cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. It is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.
TI  - Neonatal scalp abscess and fetal monitoring: factors associated with infection.
AB  - Forty-two of 929 (4.5 per cent) newborn infants prospectively studied following continuous, direct fetal heart rate monitoring during labor developed a scalp abscess at the site of electrode application during the neonatal period. Factors associated with infection with the use of a multivariate analysis were duration of monitoring (p less than 0.01) and high-risk indications for monitoring (p less than 0.01). Of the 42 infected neonates, 33 had complete bacteriologic studies. Microorganisms were isolated from all the infection tended to be polymicrobial, most commonly containing both aerobes and anaerobes. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Peptococcus were the predominant isolates. These data indicate that scalp abscess complicating intrapartum fetal monitoring may be nosocomial importance, and infants monitored should be closely observed in order to prevent more serious infectious complications.
TI  - Effect of warfarin on the induction and course of experimental Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis.
AB  - The effect of warfarin treatment on an experimental Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis was studied. Warfarin was found to affect both the induction and course of the infection of catheter-induced endocardial vegetations. In warfarin-treated rabbits, larger bacterial inocula were needed to induce an infection, and the degree of infection of the vegetations was also significantly lower, eventually resulting in the total elimination of the bacteria from the vegetations. Thus, warfarin treatment seems to have an inhibitory effect on the induction and development of an S. epidermidis infection of the endocardium. The results differ from previous findings in studies done with Streptococcus anguis, where warfarin was found to have no effect on the induction or course of the infection of endocardial vegetations, which suggests that different mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of endocarditis caused by these two species of bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of the vaginal flora.
AB  - Quantitative bacteriology was performed on vaginal secretions from healthy adult  women. The analysis included a single sample from 17 college students and 35 samples from five volunteers collected at intervals of three to five days throughout the menstrual cycle. Mean concentrations in all 52 specimens were 10(8.1) aerobic bacteria/g and 10(9.1) anaerobic bacteria/g. The rank of predominant organisms, according to rates of recovery in concentrations of greater than 10(5) colony-forming units/g, was anaerobic and facultative Lacrobacillus species, Peptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium species, Peotostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Sequential samples collected throughout the menstrual cycle showed relatively consistent mean levels of anaerobes and a significant decrease in concentrations of aerobes in premenstrual specimens compared with those in the specimens collected in the week following onset of menses. Analysis of sequential specimens from each of the five individuals showed considerable variation in species recovered. These data indicate that the vaginal flora in healthy adult women is a dynamic ecosystem in which anaerobes are usually the numerically dominant bacteria.
TI  - Lower urinary tract pathogens in the dog and their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - Ninety-six urine samples were collected by a sterile technique from 75 dogs affected with urinary tract disease (cystitis, urolithiasis, prostatitis, etc) involving bacteruria. The infecting organisms were isolated and tested against sensitivity discs (penicillin G, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulphamethoxazole/trimethaprin and Sulphatriad). The commonest isolate was Escherichia coli, which was generally sensitive to several agents, though in eight cases it was resistant to all drugs. Next in order were Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus spp. A double infection was present in 11 cases. Further data give a breakdown for sex and the clinical diagnosis, neither of which was related to any particular organism.
TI  - Lung bacterial clearance in murine pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - We studied the bactericidal capacity of the rat lung during the development of pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumonia was produced in a lower lobe by the intrabronchial instillation of 10(4)Streptococcus pneumoniae cells in buffer. Lung bacterial counts progressively increased, reaching 10(7) per lung within 48 h, and the increase was associated with localized atelectasis and consolidation. Bacterial multiplication was inhibited with tetracycline at various intervals after infection, and the subsequent clearance of pneumococci was determined. Viable pneumococci were rapidly killed by lung defenses if bacterial multiplication was inhibited within 12 h of the onset of infection. No change occurred in the bacterial populationif tetracycline was delayed until 24 h after infection, indicating that pneumococcal killing by lung defenses had ceased. This effect could be reproduced with the addition of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide to the inoculum, which produced a dose-related inhibition of pneumococcal clearance. The clearance of S. epidermidis was not impaired in the presence of pneumococcal pneumonia or by administration of exogenous capsular polysaccharide. These data indicate that pneumococcal pneumonia causes a marked impairment in lung antipneumococcal defenses within 24 h of the onset of infection. This acquired defect in antibacterial defenses may be due to the accumulation of pneumococcal capsular material in the lungs of infected animals.
TI  - Bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  - During 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. Blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. The mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. Sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). Twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: Streptococcus (5 species), Lactobacillus sp, Veillonella alcalescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Corynebacterium acnes, and Bacillus subtilis. Seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. There was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. A follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.
TI  - Antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. II. Detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  - Human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against E coli. Blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against S epidermidis, and early growth of Streptococcus fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. The concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.
TI  - Dermatitis gangrenosa infantum.
AB  - A case of a 4-month-old girl with dermatitis gangrenosa infantum is reported. The lesions were seen on the cheeks and later at the site of blood examination on the earlobes. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotics and then by skin grafting.
TI  - A simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the Caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  - An efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of Caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. The Caesarean-derived infant Dutch or Japanese-White rabbits and their hybrids (F1; Japanese-White female x Dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, A and B, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (Esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (Table 2) and administered intragastrically once a day through a Nelaton's catheter. Bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. On the third day, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. The weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (Table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of Esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. There was, however, no significant difference milk diet A and B on the weaning rate.
TI  - [Bacterial endocarditis: clinical and bacteriological aspects and prognostic factors].
AB  - The microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the Hopital cantonal, Geneva, between August 1970 and October 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. The pathogenic role of S. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. When defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. Many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. An unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main therapeutic problem. Thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. Finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. This clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.
TI  - Nonlactating-cow therapy with a formulation of penicillin and novobiocin: therapeutic and prophylactic effects.
AB  - An experimental product incorporating 500,000 IU of procaine penicillin G and 600 mg of sodium novobiocin in 2% aluminum monostearate-peanut oil gel (10-ml dose) was used to treat all quarters of 56 cows which were infected in at least 1 quarter at time of final mild-out at end of lactation. Treatment was withheld from 89 cows uninfected in all quarters. Quarter infection was determined by bacteriologic culturing of milk samples collected at the last regular milking, at intervals up to final milk-out (7 or 12 days later), at calving, and 1 week later. Clearance rates against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, and coliform bacteria in treated quarters were 83, 94, 88, and 71%, respectively. Subtraction of the spontaneous clearance rate of about 50% in untreated quarters resulted in values of 35 to 45% for drug efficacy against existing staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. Prophylactic efficacy was examined. In cows entering the true nonlactating period with 1 or more quarters infected, new infection rates across the period aming quarters uninfected at the beginning were 36.0% among untreated cows and 6.3% among treated cows (P less than 0.005). The comparable rates for cows entering the nonlactating period uninfected in all quarters were 5.7 and 0%. Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, which comprised 38.5% of new period infections among untreated cows, were completely lacking among treated cows (P less than 0.025). Within the treated group of cows, 83.1% of infected quarters were cleared, and new infection rate in the non-lactating period was 50% less than the rate among untreated cows. Because the frequency of intramammary infection in this herd was quite low at "drying-off" (10.5% of quarters), the net effect on herd health of selective therapy of cows infected at end of lactation was a reduction in total quarter infection from 19.8 to 13.6%.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of N. gonorrhoeae by bacterial interference.
AB  - Observations made in our laboratory during the past 3 years showed that the growth of some Neisseria gonorrhoeae cultures was inhibited in the presence of various bacterial contaminants of urogenital specimens. A total of 647 cultures confirmed as containing N. gonorrhoeae were examined in this study. The first part of the study was carried out on 520 N. gonorrhoeae cultures. Of these 520 cultures, 110 (21.1%) showed contamination on purity plates (GC medium, antibiotic-free). When further subcultured, 96 (87.3%) of the N. gonorrhoeae strains grew in pure culture, but 14 (12.7%) failed to grow. Subsequently, experiments were carried out on 127 pure N. gonorrhoeae cultures. The bacterial species that inhibited the growth of N. gonorrhoeae are listed in order of frequency: Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group A, and Neisseria subflava.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.

TI  - [Quantitative study and typization of aerobic bacteria in the conjunctival sacs of healthy eyes].
AB  - We carried out a qualitative and quantitative bacteriological research into the conjunctives of 220 subjects in good health mostly women (180) exempt from recent or previous eyes diseases. In order to gather conjunctival bacteria we employed with a few variations Hadley's et al. (1973 [12]) method. Among the calculated bacterial flora we found as the most numerous ones Staphylococcus epidermidis (mean valor 1960/ml), then Streptococci (480/ml), Micrococci (465/ml), Diphteroides (360/ml), Enterococci (77/ml) and numerous (700/ml) Gram-positives Cocci like Sarcina, Micrococcus tetragenes, Diplococcus, and very rarely bacterial genera Gram-negatives or Iphomycetes, also numerically inferior as regards the researches of other Authors, because owen study is carried by into eyes exempt from diseases.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - In vitro activity of josamycin against aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.
AB  - Josamycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, was compared with ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin in vitro against 25 isolates each of pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and nonenterococcal hemolytic streptococci and against 25 anaerobes including 10 Bacteroides fragilis. Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration data were obtained for the aerobic organisms, using serial twofold tube dilutions in Mueller-Hinton broth. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for the anaerobes by the agar dilution technique. Josamycin was comparable to erythromycin and clindamycin in activity against the pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci and was more active than clindamycin against enterococci. It was somewhat less active than ampicillin against enterococci and S. epidermidis and showed its greatest in vitro activity against anaerobes, being comparable to clindamycin.
TI  - The fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  - Units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, Seratia marcesens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Paracolabacterum aerogenoides (Enterobacter hafriae), Mima polymorpha or Acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. When inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. When inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 C. Three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. These data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may be unnecessarily restrictive.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the female rat genital tract.
AB  - A study of the genital microflora in virgin female rats of reproductive age has demonstrated that alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella pneumotropica, diphtheroid bacilli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis are the predominant genital organisms. The pH of the rat vagina was demonstrated to be near neutrality. It is suggested that the higher pH in the rat vagina as compared to the human vagina may account for some of the differences between human and rat genital microflora.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - [Clinical experience with amoxicillin in otorhinolaryngology (author's transl)].
AB  - This paper reports the clinical trial of amoxicillin. (1) A daily dose of 750 approximately 1,000 mg of amoxicillin was orally administered for 3 approximately 12 days to 20 patients, 7 of which were with acute suppurative tympanitis, 3 with furuncle of the ear, 2 with furuncle of the nose and 8 with acute amygdalitis. As a result, amoxicillin proved remarkably effective or effective in 17 patients (85.0%). (2) Amoxicillin was effective against: Staphylococcus aureus in 10 of 11 patients (90.9%) Staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 of 2 patients (100%) Streptococcus hemolyticus in 3 of 4 patients (75%) Streptococcus viridans in 1 of 1 patient (100%) Diplococcus pneumoniae in 1 of 1 patient (100%) (3) Although one patient developed drug eruption, there were no side effects that necessitated cessation of administration. From the above results, it is concluded that amoxicillin can be used in the treatment of otorhinolaryngologic infections.
TI  - Meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  - Colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. Among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Since the microcontour of the canine distal urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina. The normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. It consisted principally of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. Estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-Streptococcus and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. A normal canine transient, Escherichia coli, and a normal resident, Corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. In contrast, human Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus (8.5 days). The commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. Thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the susceptibility to colonization.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the conjunctival sac of the horse].
AB  - The AA. report the results of taxonomic research conducted on the conjunctival sac of 59 horses for identification of the present bacterial flora. In the controlled animals, it was observed, at the level of the considered niche, a community constituted of normal bacterial populations, but not autochtonous in the significance they attributed from DUBOS et al., relative to the characterization of the indigenous microbiota of the intestine. The isolated normal bacterial flora seems to be constituted of: Micrococcus (subgroup 6 of Baird-Parker, M. luteus, Micrococcus spp.) isolated in 49,15% of the samples; Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis (18,64%); Moraxella osloensis, M. phenylpiruvica, M. equi and Moraxella spp. (11,86%); Bacillus cereus (11,86%); Neisseria catarrhalis (8,47%); Streptococcus equi and Str. zooepidemicus (6,77%); Corynebacterium spp. (6,77%) and Acinetobacter lwoffi (5,08%). The AA. have found, besides, a particular group of bacteria of uncertain classification, attributed to the coryneforms and found in 30,50% of the examined horses. So-called transient bacteria taxa have been considered are Streptomyces spp., isolated in the 10,16% of the controlled subjects, Aerococcus viridans and Bacillus spp. found in only one equine.
TI  - [Development and resistance of staphylococci in Bulgaricus milk].
AB  - Studied was the dynamics of development of 9 strains of staphilococci isolated from humans and animals, kept in heat-treated milk, and their resistance in Bulgarian sour milk. It was established that the pathogenic Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis develop will in fresh milk kept up to 7 days at 2--6degreesC and 18--22degreesC. In the production of Bulgarian sour milk Staph, aureus was shown to be viable, remaining active for seven days at 2 to 6degreesC. At room temperature (18--22degreesC) the survival rate has been dependent on the dynamics of accumulating metabolite products in connection with the development of Lactobac. bulgaricum and Streptococcus thermophilus. When the total acidity value reaches 160degreesT the pathogenic staphylococci are destroyed. Staphylococcus epidermidis finds no favourable medium to develop in Bulgarian sour milk, and it perishes when the total acidity is 120degreesT and pH -- 3.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in materials from patients with nonspecific odontogenic infections].
AB  - The results of bacteriological studies made between 1964 and 1971 by workers at the Varia Laboratory, Institute of Medical Microbiology on 767 patients treated at the Clinic of Gnathofacial Surgery, Department of Medicine, Friedrich Schiller University at Jena, are evaluated. The testees (x=275) were included in groups with specific diagnoses, and a breakdown was made according to the detection of aerobic pus-forming germs. Gram-positive cocci were detected in 92% of the cases and their pathogenetic representatives, 76,5% of the cases. Rodshaped germs (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas) were observed only in 37,9% of the cases. Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 62,5%, was the most frequently observed species. It was followed, in order of frequency of detection, by greening streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Monoinfection was far more frequently observed than multi-infection. Also, the problems associated with the differentiation of streptococci are pointed out since other investigators found streptococci to be the most frequent agents producing odontogenic infections.
TI  - Partial characterisation of an inhibitor of streptolysin O produced by bacterial  growth in serum.
AB  - An inhibitor of streptolysin O is generated in human and animal sera by the growth of certain organisms. The ability to do this occurs most often in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (in 90% and 86% of strains respectively), but in only 32% of Staph. epidermidis strains. The inhibitor is not formed in broth. The effect appears slowly on incubation, with maximum activity after 4-7 days. Evidence suggests that two enzymes are involved, an esterase which splits ester-bound cholesterol and a proteolytic enzyme which partially hydrolyses lipoprotein, resulting in cholesterol remaining attached to protein or polypeptide fractions but with some alteration of its spatial configuration such that it is now capable of attaching to streptolysin O. The inhibitory factor appears to prevent streptolysin becoming attached to cholesterol receptor sites on the erythrocyte membrane. Removal of the precursor from serum with magnesium carbonate suggests that low-density lipoproteins may be the precursor of the inhibitor.
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (BB-K8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)Antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, various groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) Amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) On many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large MIC against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small MIC against amikacin.
TI  - Relationship of bacterial infection in urine and calculi to canine urolithiasis.
AB  - In 26 dogs treated surgically for urolithiasis, bacteriological examination of the urine and the interior of calculi showed that infection was present in both materials in 14 cases. Infection with phosphate calculi, present in 13 of these 14 dogs, was associated with a variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. In a follow-up examination of 16 dogs, organisms different from the original isolates were recovered from some cases. The significance of the persistence of viable bacteria within canine bladder calculi is discussed.
TI  - Interaction of peptidoglycans with anti-IgGs and with complement.
AB  - This report describes the interaction of peptidoglycan (Streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus lysodeikticus) with 2 serum mediator systems, namely with the anti-IgG system and with complement. The observation that the majority of rabbits hyperimmunized with A-variant streptococcal vaccine produced anti-group carbohydrate antisera containing anti-IgGs and antibodies directed to peptidoglycan suggested that the production of these 2 latter antibodies was related. This view was supported by the finding of a monoclonal 7S anti-IgG with antibody specificity for the pentapeptide of peptidoglycan as evidenced by inhibition of the coprecipitation of 7S anti-IgG with antigen-antibody complexes by the pentapeptide. Inhibition of the anti-idiotype reaction by the pentapeptide provided further evidence for the antibody specificity of 7S anti-IgG for peptidoglycan. When added to normal human sera all peptidoglycan preparations inhibited the hemolytic activity of the sera. Consumption of C3 in C2 deficient serum and consumption of C2 in normal serum indicated the activation of both known complement pathways. Activation of the classical pathway of complement was more efficient since 50 mug of peptidoglycan consumed approximately 70% of C2 per ml normal serum whereas more than 2 mg of the same preparations was required to inactivate 17-24% of C3 in C2 deficient sera. Each of the different peptidoglycan preparations consumed similar amounts of complement in all 20 sera tested. This finding suggested that activation of the classical complement pathway by peptidoglycan was not mediated by anti-peptidoglycan antibodies present in only 20-40% of normal human sera.
TI  - Migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group A and B streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. In the present studies peptidoglycans from S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group A streptococcal peptidoglycan. In contrast, HSA-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. Sensitization of animals with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; HSA-pentapeptide again showed no activity. However, when HSA-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was evident. Skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to HSA-pentapeptide.
TI  - Endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. The pyrogenic response of rabbit to group A streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or TCA is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. The pyrogenicity can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of the material by lysozyme. Peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group B and L streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group A streptococcus peptidoglycan. Spirillum serpens and Escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. Repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. Cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. Rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to S. aureus and group A streptococcus peptidoglycans. Intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages of the degenerative and necrotic process. Local Shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. The results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. Non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. These properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. The data presented suggest the role of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  - Sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin S by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the N-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. In concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Eschierichia coli but not of Streptococcus faecalis. Viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by cyanate; however, production of [14-C] carbon dioxide from [1-14-C] glucose and the iodination of 125-I during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. Cyanate is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of H-2-O-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). Since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they are due to amino carbamylation.
TI  - The survival and growth of microorganisms in mascara during use.
AB  - Over 150 mascaras representing eight popular brands were examined for their susceptibility to microbial contamination during their use by study group members. Additional mascaras from patients with symptoms and clinical findings of long-term blepharitis also were investigated. Early in the study, two brands without preservatives supported reproducing populations of microorganisms, including potential eye pathogens. These products, as currently manufactured, were recalcitrant to microbial attack. Microbes associated with the facial skin and fingers of the study group users were typically isolated from mascaras after use. Initial microorganisms isolated from mascaras were usually transients. Establishment of reproducing populations within the cosmetics appeared related to the number of uses, personal habits of the user, and the formulation of the product. Four patients with staphylococcal blepharitis and cosmetics heavily laden with Staphylococcus epidermidis showed marked clinical improvement when they stopped using the contaminated cosmetics. The application of used eye area makeup prior to and following ocular surgery should be avoided.
TI  - Intramammary infections in the sow during the peripartum period.
AB  - The incidence and ype of aerobic bacteria causing intramammary infection (IMI) in two groups of peripartum sows were determined. The incidence of IMI in 24 sows near farrowing was 30.2 percent; the incidence in 16 machine-milked sows was 81.0 percent. Numerous mixed IMI were detected. The bacterium causing most IMI was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by beta hemolytic streptococci, aslpha hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids. The beta hemolytic streptococci and E. coli cultures were studied in detail. The relationship of bacterial IMI to agalactiae toxemia is discussed.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
TI  - Natural history of impetigo. II. Etiologic agents and bacterial interactions.
AB  - Intensive observations on 37 children in a population with endemic skin infections provided an opportunity to study the interrelationships between and the significance of the bacterial genera commonly associated with impetigo. Cultures of the respiratory tract, three normal skin sites, and lesions, when present, were taken three times weekly from July to October 1969. Impetigo developed in all 37 children. Group A streptococci alone were recovered from 21% of 361 lesions, Staphylococcus aureus alone from 8%, Staphylococcus epidermidis alone from 5% and mixtures of streptococci and staphylococci from 61%. Vesicular or pustular lesions were more often pure streptococcal than pure staphylococcal. Streptococci alone were more often recovered from early stage lesions rather than from later ones. The pure staphylococcal lesions characteristically occurred early in the season whereas streptococcal or mixed lesions had later peaks.Serial observations on 74 lesions revealed longer persistence of streptococci than staphylococci in mixed lesions. In 85% of the instances the same streptococcal serotype was recovered repeatedly from an individual lesion, whereas staphylococcal types changed in 57% of instances. Phage type 75 accounted for the majority of staphylococcal isolates from all sites, whereas phage type 54 was recovered only from skin lesions. In contrast to streptococci, the site sequence of staphylococcal spread was from the nose to normal skin to skin lesions. These studies reveal important differences in the migration of staphylococci (as compared with streptococci) to various body sites and suggest a subsidiary role for staphylococci in nonbullous impetiginous lesions yielding both organisms.
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  - Agar medium for the selective enumeration of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus from the rat alimentary tract.
AB  - A selective agar medium (medium J(1)) is proposed for the quantitative enumeration of egg yolk-positive (EYP) and egg yolk-negative (EYN) Staphylococcus pyogenes from the digestive tract and feces of the rat. This medium, buffered at pH 5.0, is composed of acid casein hydrolysate and yeast extract with 7.5% sodium chloride, 1.6% sodium pyruvate, 0.0008% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), and 6% egg yolk emulsion. Inoculation is by the pour-plate method and incubation is at 38 C in a water-jacketed incubator for 36 hr. Colonies of S. pyogenes reduce TTC; EYP strains are surrounded by a halo of opacity; and EYN strains may be surrounded by a red halo, but no opacity. Small, white colonies of S. epidermidis may develop, but Micrococcus, and all other groups of Staphylococcus recognized in the rat intestinal flora, are inhibited. Other bacterial genera, notably Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Proteus, and Streptococcus, are also inhibited.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
