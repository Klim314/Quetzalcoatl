TI  == cloning and dna sequence analysis of an immunogenic glucose-galactose mglb lipoprotein homologue from brachyspira pilosicoli, the agent of colonic spirochetosis.
AB  == colonic spirochetosis (cs) is a newly emerging infectious disease of humans and animals caused by the pathogenic spirochete brachyspira (formerly serpulina) pilosicoli. the purpose of this study was to characterize an antigen that was recognized by antibodies present in sera of challenge-exposed pigs. the gene encoding the antigen was identified by screening a plasmid library of human b. pilosicoli strain sp16 (atcc 49776) genomic dna with hyperimmune and convalescent swine sera. the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cloned b. pilosicoli gene had a high degree of similarity and identity to glucose-galactose mglb lipoprotein. located 106 bp downstream of the putative mglb gene was a 3'-truncated open reading frame with 73.8% similarity and 66.3% identity to mgla  of escherichia coli, suggesting a gene arrangement within an operon which is similar to those of other bacteria. a single copy of the gene was present in b. pilosicoli, and homologous sequences were widely conserved among porcine intestinal spirochetes serpulina intermedia, brachyspira innocens, brachyspira murdochii, and the avian brachyspira alvinipulli, but not in porcine brachyspira  hyodysenteriae, human brachyspira aalborgi, and porcine treponema succinifaciens. the deduced molecular weight of the mature mglb lipoprotein was consistent with expression by the cloned gene of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight  of 36,000, as determined by western blot analysis and [(3)h]palmitate labeling. because mucin is the principal constituent of the colonic mucus gel and consists  of glycoproteins that can serve as the substrate for growth and chemotaxis of b.  pilosicoli in vitro, a role for mglb in mucosal localization of the spirochete appears consistent with the pathogenesis of cs. however, the presence of homologous sequences in closely related but nonpathogenic commensal spirochetes suggests that other virulence determinants may be required for pathogenesis.

TI  == outer membrane-associated serine protease of intestinal spirochetes.
AB  == pathogenic intestinal spirochetes cause damage to the intestinal mucosa of humans and animals by an unknown mechanism. the purpose of this study was to assess the  pathogenic intestinal spirochetes serpulina hyodysenteriae, serpulina pilosicoli, and brachyspira aalborgi and the non-pathogenic commensal intestinal spirochetes  serpulina innocens and treponema succinifaciens for protease activity. a partially heat stable, subtilisin-like, serine protease was identified in the outer membrane of all spirochetes and thus may be essential for survival in the intestinal environment. the outer membrane protease may indirectly contribute to  intestinal damage caused by pathogenic spirochetes during association with the mucosal surface of the host.
