TI  == production of xylooligosaccharides from corncob xylan by fungal xylanase and their utilization by probiotics.
AB  == the selective production of xylooligosaccharides (xos) was carried out using partially purified xylanase from aspergillus foetidus mtcc 4898. corncob xylan was extracted using a mild alkali treatment which yielded 178.73+/-5.8 g of xylan/kg of corncobs. partially purified beta-xylosidase free xylanase was found  efficient in releasing xylooligosaccharides from corncob xylan. maximum yield of  xylooligosaccharides was 6.73+/-0.23 mg/ml after 8 h of reaction time using 20 u  of xylanase at 45 degrees c. purification of xos was done using activated charcoal column chromatography. the purified xos preparation contained mainly xylobiose and xylotriose. xos mixture was found suitable for food industry looking at its high thermal stability at low ph. prebiotic effect of xos was evaluated by in vitro fermentation of xos using known probiotic strains viz. bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus. the results of this study revealed better growth of bifidobacterium spp. on xos than lactobacillus spp.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.

TI  == distribution of salivary lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == we surveyed the distribution of salivary lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in periodontitis patients and healthy subjects. approximately 700 lactobacilli and 300 bifidobacterial isolates were obtained from 16 young, orally healthy subjects (mean age +/- standard deviation: 21.0+/-2.0 y), 16 periodontitis patients (51.6+/-13.8 y), and 14 well-maintained former periodontitis patients (60.2+/-9.6 y). among eleven lactobacillus species detected in saliva, l. salivarius, l. gasseri, and l. fermentum were prevalent, but no species was specifically associated with periodontal health. in contrast,  of four bifidobacterium species, b. adolescentis was specifically (p<0.05) prevalent in young healthy subjects compared with the other two groups. furthermore, the bifidobacterial count of the well-maintained subjects was the highest (p<0.05) among the groups. these results suggest that bifidobacterial count and species might be associated with periodontal health status and/or age.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).
