TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of gv129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == in vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam ly127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == hr 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  == hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus spp. (indole positive), enterobacter spp., salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, and staphylococcus aureus. in every comparison, except that with the last organism, hr 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. all three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, hr 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. hr 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of streptococcus pyogenes,  lancefield group d streptococci, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against bacteriodes fragilis.  hr 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of  these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. hr 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against s. pyogenes; against lancefield group d,  penicillin was 32 times as active as hr 756. hr 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (p. aeruginosa and group d streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. a series of seven transfers of selected strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp., s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa through medium containing hr 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. resistance to hr 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.
