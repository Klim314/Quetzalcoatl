TI  == particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children.
AB  == infectious endocarditis (ie) represents a rare pathology in children, but with lethal potential. the goal of the therapy is fast and total eradication of the infection. aims: to study particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children. material and methods: children with infectious endocarditis hospitalized between january 2007 - february 2012 in the  cardiology department of the ,,sfanta maria" children emergency hospital of lasi  have been included in the study. results: the patients are aged between 23 days and 16 years, the average age being 4 years old. at approximately 88% of the patients (14 cases), the endocardial damage appeared in the pre-existent valvular lesions, specially mitral and aortal. as associated congenital malformations, the patients prevailingly presented ventricular septal defect, mitral valve prolapse, arterial canal persistence, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta. blood cultures were collected and the most frequent identified etiological agents were: staphylococcus coagulase-positive, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus speciae coagulase-negative, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus bovis, escherichia coli, for which the antibiogram showed sensitivity for beta-lactam, cephalosporins, glycopeptides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, quinolone, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, and thus specific treatment was set up according to the antibiogram. conclusions: the infectious endocarditis is a serious disease that affects young age too, leading towards exitus in some cases. diagnostic imaging and early blood cultures are of relevance in order to intervene promptly. the treatment must be targeted and applied as fast as possible.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of gram-positive cocci. quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/l, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/l, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/l and enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/l.

TI  == [the use of teicoplanin in neutropenic patients: values and limits].
AB  == the efficacy and the safety of teicoplanin were evaluated for the treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. a total of 18 patients received teicoplanin once daily as an intravenous injection of 200 mg in 6 patients (after a loading dose of 400 mg) or 400 mg in 12 patients (loading dose: 800 mg). the mean duration of therapy was 15.9 days (range 9 to 39 days). in all patients teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic usually a beta-lactam. thirteen  of 18 patients were successfully treated. three febrile episodes proved to be microbiologically documented infections and were cured by teicoplanin: one streptococcus mitis and two methicillin-resistant (methi-r) staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremias. neither toxicity nor side effects were observed in the reported group. six patients experiencing reactions to vancomycin (2 cases of cutaneous allergy) or to vancomycin and amphotericin b combination (4 cases of nephrotoxicity) were subsequently treated with teicoplanin without any evidence of cross-sensitivity. we observed emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 3 patients receiving teicoplanin: 20, 18 and 8 days after a first febrile episode cured by teicoplanin and a beta-lactam, they developed fever while receiving the same antibiotic regimen. methi-r staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood cultures in the first patient  and methi-r staphylococcus haemolyticus in the two other patients. in one patient, successfully treated by teicoplanin for a first febrile episode related  to a methi-r staphylococcus epidermidis, emergence of staphylococcus haemolyticus occurred 8 days later while the patient was on teicoplanin therapy (6 mg/kg). mics of teicoplanin were 16 mg/l for the two staphylococcus strains isolated in this patient.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
