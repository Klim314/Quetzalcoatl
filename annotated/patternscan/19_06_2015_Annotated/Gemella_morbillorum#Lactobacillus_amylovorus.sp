TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.
