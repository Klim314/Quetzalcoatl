TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 DNA probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDDH) technique. METHODS: Eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. Each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. After 30 days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by CDDH. Data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). Forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +Treponema socranskii," and the cluster of Actinomyces) were assessed. RESULTS: Most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for Streptococcus constellatus, Campylobacter rectus, Tannerella forsythia, T socranskii, and Lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), Propionibacterium acnes I and Eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and Treponema denticola (77.8%). Among the cariogenic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than L acidophillus and Lactobacillus casei (P <0.001). The periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +T socranskii" (P <0.0001). Among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, Veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (P <0.0001). The numbers of yellow and green complex bacteria and the cluster of Actinomyces were similar (P >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.
TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - Prevention of 5-fluorouracil-induced infection with indigenous Escherichia coli in tumor-bearing mice by nonspecific immunostimulation.
AB  - We have previously reported that the lethal toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in  specific-pathogen-free mice is due to an indigenous infection with Escherichia coli (K. Nomoto, T. Yokokura, Y. Yoshikai, et al. Can. J. Microbiol. 37:244-247, 1991). In the present study, we demonstrate that nonspecific immunostimulation augments host resistance against the lethal toxicity of 5-FU in tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous administration of a preparation of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (LC 9018), a nonspecific immunostimulant, at a dose of 20 mg/kg to BALB/c mice augmented their resistance against the lethal toxicity of 5-FU if the preparation was injected into the mice 10-40 days before administration of 5-FU. Injection of LC 9018 into BALB/c mice bearing Meth A fibrosarcoma also enhanced their resistance against the lethality of 5-FU. Systemic infection with E. coli was induced in all of the 5-FU-treated tumor-bearing mice 10 days or more after administration of the drug at a lethal dose of 500 mg/kg, and it was accompanied by an overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestine. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with LC 9018 resulted in decreased rates of occurrence of systemic infection with E. coli and inhibition of overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestine after administration of 5-FU. A single administration of either LC 9018 or 5-FU significantly inhibited the growth of Meth A cells in vivo, and a combined antitumor effect was shown in the mice treated with both 5-FU and LC 9018.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo release of cytostatic factors from Lactobacillus casei-elicited peritoneal macrophages after stimulation with tumor cells and immunostimulants.
AB  - The effect of tumor cells and immunostimulants on the release of cytostatic factors (CF) from Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC)-, Corynebacterium parvum (CP)- or peptone-elicited peritoneal macrophages (PM) was investigated in vitro and in vivo. Significant release of CF into the culture medium from PM elicited with LC was induced by seven of eight mitomycin C-pretreated tumor cell lines and not by normal spleen cells, while no CF was released extracellularly from peptone-elicited PM given the same stimulus. CF were released from LC-elicited PM (LCEPM) after stimulation with LC, bacille Calmette-Guerin, streptococcal preparation OK-432, fucoidan or lipopolysaccharide, and LC but not CP induced CF production in the peritoneal cavities of LC- or CP-primed mice. The release of CF from LCEPM after stimulation with mitomycin C-pretreated 3T12-3 cells was inhibited by D-mannose and not by L-fucose. L-Rhamnose and mannose 6-phosphate, but not D-mannose or L-fucose, caused the release of CF from the PM. It was suggested that the release of CF from activated PM is caused by stimulation by some tumor cells, sugars, or bacterial immunostimulants, D-Mannose and L-rhamnose on the surface of tumor cells or bacteria, respectively, may plan an important role in the release of CF from activated macrophages.
TI  - The role of superoxide anion and lysosomal enzymes in anti-listerial activity of  elicited peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - The in vitro effect of superoxide anion and lysosomal enzyme activity on the killing of Listeria monocytogenes EGD (listeria) by peritoneal macrophages (PM) was investigated. Generation of superoxide anion by PM stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was significantly increased by intraperitoneal injection of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018) or Corynebacterium parvum (CP), but not by injection of peptone. However, superoxide anion generation by LC9018-elicited PM stimulated with listeria was not increased any more than that by peptone-elicited PM, and generation of superoxide anion by the PM was affected by the difference in stimuli. The killing of listeria by LC9018- or CP-elicited PM in vitro was significantly less than that by peptone-elicited PM or resident PM. Significant correlation was observed between the anti-listerial activity of PM and the intracellular killing of listeria by PM. On the other hand, beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase activities of LC9018-elicited, CP-elicited, or resident PM were significantly weaker than those of peptone-elicited PM, and no significant correlation was observed between the increase in beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase activities and the increase in anti-listerial activity. These results suggest that increase in the activity of lysosomal enzymes such as beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase is not correlated with the anti-listerial activity of PM, and that superoxide anion has very little effect on the anti-listerial activity of PM in vitro.
TI  - Enhancement of hematopoietic response of mice by subcutaneous administration of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Mice that had received heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (LC 9018) subcutaneously (s.c.) showed enhanced resistance to systemic (i.e., intravenous) infection with Listeria monocytogenes, but the antilisterial resistance of mice was less augmented by s.c. administration of Propionibacterium acnes ("Corynebacterium parvum"). Though there was little change in the total number of splenic leukocytes after s.c. administration of LC 9018, the monocyte-macrophage ratio increased after treatment, reaching its peak on day 5 to 7 after injection. The number of progenitor cells that form macrophage colonies under the stimulus of L-cell-conditioned medium in a semisolid agar culture system increased in the spleens of mice pretreated s.c. with LC 9018, showing a peak response on day 5 after injection. The increase corresponded to the increase in the dose administered, and increased numbers were detected even 10 days after treatment. The number of macrophage colonies in the femurs of mice pretreated s.c. with LC 9018 showed a temporary increase on day 3 after injection but then a decrease until day 10. Colony-stimulating activity was detected in the sera of mice administered LC 9018 s.c. 18 h previously, and the colonies produced were of three types: granulocyte (8%), macrophage (56%), and granulocyte-macrophage (36%). Administration of C. parvum s.c. had little effect on these hematopoietic responses of mice.
TI  - Protection of mice against herpes simplex virus infection by a Lactobacillus casei preparation (LC 9018) in combination with inactivated viral antigen.
AB  - Heat-killed Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC 9018) cells enhanced the resistance  to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in adult mice, but not significantly. The protection of mice against HSV-1 infection and the production of neutralizing antibodies were significantly enhanced by the administration of LC 9018 in combination with inactivated HSV-1 antigen. The optimal enhancement of resistance was seen in mice 14 days after the simultaneous administration of these substances. The resistance to HSV-1 infection in mice could be transferred with peritoneal exudate cells from syngeneic mice previously treated with LC 9018 alone and LC 9018 in combination with inactivated HSV-1 antigen or with thioglycollate broth, whereas the transfer of peritoneal exudate cells induced by thioglycollate broth alone and of spleen cells induced by LC 9018 in combination with thioglycollate broth or by thioglycollate broth alone was not effective. These results suggest that mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by the administration of LC 9018 in combination with inactivated HSV-1 antigen may play an important role in host defense mechanisms against HSV-1 infection.
TI  - Protective effect of Lactobacillus casei on Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice.
AB  - The protective effect of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei YIT9018 (LC 9018) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice was compared with that of Corynebacterium parvum. Survival of mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with P. aeruginosa was augmented in mice that had been pretreated i.p. with LC 9018 5 days previously. Similar treatment of mice with C. parvum, however, was not effective at all. Moreover, mice became more susceptible to infection with P. aeruginosa after such treatment. Growth of P. aeruginosa in the peritoneal cavity and spleen was markedly inhibited in LC 9018-pretreated mice, whereas such inhibition of bacterial growth was not observed in C. parvum-treated mice. The protective effect of LC 9018 was observed in mice subjected to 800 rads of whole body irradiation but was abrogated when mice were treated with carrageenan. These results suggest that augmentation of the resistance of mice to P. aeruginosa was caused by the induction of activated macrophages. The number of macrophages detectable in the peritoneal cavity was almost the same in LC 9018- and C. parvum-treated mice. Growth of Listeria monocytogenes was inhibited by pretreatment with LC 9018. Inhibition of L. monocytogenes was also observed after the same pretreatment with C. parvum. It was suggested that macrophages activated with LC 9018 were involved in the protective immunity to P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cytotoxic factor production by Kupffer cells elicited with Lactobacillus casei and Corynebacterium parvum.
AB  - The ability of Kupffer cells, spleen macrophages, pulmonary macrophages, and peritoneal macrophages (PM) to produce cytotoxic factor (CTF) was investigated in vitro. The production of CTF by Kupffer cells elicited with Corynebacterium parvum (CP) or Lactobacillus casei YIT9018 (LC9018) was higher than that of spleen, pulmonary macrophages, or PM. In addition, oxygen radical (OR) production by Kupffer cells or PM was measured. The production of OR by Kupffer cells or PM was significantly augmented by i.v. or i.p. injection of LC9018 or CP. No significant correlation was observed between the increase in OR production by Kupffer cells or PM and CTF production by Kupffer cells or PM elicited with either organism. It was suggested that activated Kupffer cells may be one important source of CTF production in serum and that the CTF-producing macrophages may be different from the OR-producing macrophages.
TI  - Reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  - Germfree (GF) F344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis (BCG). Specific pathogene-free (SPF) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. The rats colonized with Escherichia coli or Bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in SPF rats. The rats colonized with Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus casei, L. fermentum, L. murini, and L. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in GF rats. Furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of E. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in SPF rats. These results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of SPF rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, P. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and E. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.
TI  - [Influence of Corynebacterium parvum, BCG, OK-432 and Lactobacillus casei on the  hepatic drug-metabolizing systems and on the oxygen radical production by fixed macrophages in liver of BALB/c mouse].
AB  
TI  - Oxygen radical production by peritoneal macrophages and Kupffer cells elicited with Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v.) with Lactobacillus casei YIT9018 (LC 9018). The i.p. injected LC 9018 augmented oxygen radical (OR) production by peritoneal macrophages (PM) and suppressed the production of prostaglandin E2 by PM. The growth of i.p. inoculated Meth A fibrosarcoma was also inhibited by an i.p. injection of LC 9018. i.v. injection of LC 9018 stimulated OR production by fixed macrophages and inhibited the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in the liver. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the liver was significantly increased (10 to 20 times) by LC 9018 i.v. injection. A significant correlation was observed between the augmentation of OR production by PM or fixed macrophages in the liver and inhibition of growth of Meth A or L. monocytogenes. The augmentation of OR production by LC 9018 was more marked and was maintained for a longer period of time than that by other bacterial immunostimulants.
TI  - Comparison of antitumor activity of Lactobacillus casei with other bacterial immunopotentiators.
AB  - Antitumor activity of Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018) was demonstrated by intralesional (i.l.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration into tumor-bearing mice which were inoculated with methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma (Meth A) or Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed tumor (K234) cells. Its activity was significantly superior to the activity of two other species of lactobacilli but was nearly the same as that of Corynebacterium parvum or Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). I.l. or i.v. administration of LC9018 into the tumor bearers caused local transient swelling or hepatosplenomegaly but did not cause other pronounced lesions. There was no significant difference in the degree of hepatosplenomegaly in LC9018 and that in other immunopotentiators. In mice whose tumors had regressed as a result of administration of LC9018 or the other immunopotentiators, the phytohemagglutinin P (PHA-P) response of the spleen cells was less than that of mice whose tumors progressed, and approached the normal level. The PHA-P response of popliteal lymph node cells proximal to the tumor lesion was fairly low compared with the splenic PHA-P response and there was no difference between the lymphocytes from mice whose tumors had regressed or progressed. Adjuvant activity of LC9018 in inducing tumor immunity was demonstrated by administering a mixture of LC9018 and Meth A cells to mice. This adjuvant activity was of the same efficiency as that of C. parvum and BCG. The presence of the antitumor activity of LC9018 in cell wall components was deduced from fact that removal of its cell wall by endo-N-acetylmuramidase (M-1 enzyme) abolished the activity. The possible availability of LC9018 for immunotherapy of tumors is discussed.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Immunological cross-reactivity of oral non-streptococcal bacteria with mammalian  tissue.
AB  - The presence of cross-reacting antigens between oral non-steptococcal bacteria and human and monkey tissue was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence. Rabbit antisera, prepared against 22 oral bacteria, were incubated with cryostatcut sections of heart, skeletal muscle, brain cord, liver, kidney, and skin. A cell wall antigen of Lactobacillus casei was shared with neuroglial brain cells, and an antigenic component of Propionibacterium acnes was shared with kidney glomeruli. Tissue-reactive antibodies were absorbed from the sera with preparations of both the homologous bacterium and tissue fractions.
