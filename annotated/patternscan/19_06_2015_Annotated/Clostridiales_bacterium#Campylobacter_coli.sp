TI  == susceptibility to campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural campylobacter infection in exposed  poultry abattoir workers. the gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16s amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of campylobacter infection in sweden. the gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for campylobacter and those who remained negative. individuals who became campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.007) and escherichia (p = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.017) and streptococcus (p = 0.034) sequences than the campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of clostridiales (p = 0.017), unclassified lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), and anaerovorax (p = 0.015) sequences. intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the campylobacter-positive group (p < 0.005). the results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to campylobacter colonization in humans and that campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. importance: studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. the relative abundances of escherichia coli and bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to gram-negative pathogens in general and campylobacter infection in particular. in this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for campylobacter. as their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of bacteroides spp. and e. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance  also in humans.

TI  == campylobacter colonization of the turkey intestine in the context of microbial community development.
AB  == patterns of microbial community dynamics in the turkey intestine were examined. every week of the 18-week production cycle, cecal bacterial communities and campylobacter loads were examined from five birds for each of two flocks. molecular fingerprinting via the automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (arisa) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) of the cecal samples revealed that microbial communities changed in a time-dependent manner, and during both trials they developed via transition through three phases during the production cycle. a core component of the microbiota consisting of 11  bacteroidetes types was present throughout both trials. in contrast, constant succession was detected in the clostridiales populations until week 10 or 11, with few shared sequences between the flocks. changes in campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli loads were correlated to, but not dependent on, the two acute  transitions delimiting the three developmental phases.
