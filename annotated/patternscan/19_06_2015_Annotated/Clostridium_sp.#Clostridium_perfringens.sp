TI  == phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  == phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. in total, 400 one-day-old female ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. the dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (pc) or insufficient calcium (ca) and digestible phosphor  (dp)(nc) and with or without 5000 phytase units (ftu)/kg of escherichia coli 6-phytase. the gastrointestinal tract ph values, ileal microbial communities and  short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly affected ph in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the nc resulted in a ph increase in the ileum.  the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. the addition of phytase increased lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp. whereas in case  of clostridium leptum subgroup, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, bifidobacterium sp. and streptococcus/lactococcus counts, a significant  ca and dp level x phytase interaction was found. however, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and ca and dp levels were not  consistent. furthermore, the reduction of ca and dp level lowered clostridium perfringens and enterobacteriaceae counts. the analysis of fermentation products  showed that reducing the ca and dp content in the diet reduced total scfa, dl-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the nc group. this suggests that p is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. it may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of p and ca in a diet.

TI  == characteristics of metroxylon sagu resistant starch type iii as prebiotic substance.
AB  == resistant starch type iii (rs3 ) was produced from sago (metroxylon sagu) and evaluated for its characteristics as a prebiotic. two rs3 samples designated sago rs and hcl-sago rs contained 35.71% and 68.30% rs, respectively, were subjected to hydrolyses by gastric juice and digestive enzymes and to absorption. both sago rs and hcl-sago rs were resistant to 180 min hydrolysis by gastric acidity at ph  1 to 4 with less than 0.85% hydrolyzed. both samples were also resistant toward hydrolysis by gastrointestinal tract enzymes and intestinal absorption with 96.75% and 98.69% of rs3 were recovered respectively after 3.5 h digestion and overnight dialysis at 37 degrees c. sago rs3 supported the growth of both beneficial (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) and pathogenic microbes (escherichia coli, campylobacter coli, and clostridium perfringens) in the range of 2.60 to 3.91 log10 cfu/ml. hence, prebiotic activity score was applied to describe the extent to which sago rs3 supports selective growth of the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains over pathogenic bacteria. the highest scores were obtained from bifidobacterium sp. ftdc8943 grown on sago rs (+0.26) and hcl-sago rs (+0.24) followed by l. bulgaricus ftdc1511 grown on sago rs (+0.21). the findings had suggested that sago rs3 has the prebiotic partial characteristics and it is suggested to further assess the suitability of sago rs3 as a prebiotic material.

TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == at high altitude (ha) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (gi) disorder are very  common phenomena. to explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the gi functions, were subjected following  simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. for this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. it was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the population density of strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (gdi). in relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of iga and igg increased in duration dependent manner. the activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered gsh/gssg pool in the intestinal epithelia. histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. it can be concluded that hypoxia at ha modified gi microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small  intestinal dysfunction at ha.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == investigation on antibacterial and antioxidant activities, phenolic and flavonoid contents of some thai edible plants as an alternative for antibiotics.
AB  == this study was aimed to examine the antibacterial and antioxidative properties of seven edible plants from thailand to develop alternative antibiotics as feed additives. the plants include citrus aurantifolia swingle (lime) fruits and its leaves, sesbania grandiflora l. (agati sesbania) leaves, piper sarmentosum roxb (wild betal) leaves, curcuma domestica valeton (turmeric) roots, morinda citrifolia l. (beach mulberry) leaves, cassia siamea britt (siamea cassia) leaves, and cocos nucifera l. (coconut) peels. the plants were extracted by methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. antibacterial activities with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined by agar diffusion assay against escherichia coli, burkholderia sp., haemopilus somnus, haemopilus parasuis, and clostridium perfringens that were considered pathogenic  strains in livestock infection. methanol extracts of c. aurantifolia swingle fruits and leaves showed the broadest spectrum of antibacterial activities except for c. perfringens. butanol extract of s. grandiflora l. leaves showed the strongest activity against burkholderia sp. with mic, 135 mug/ml. p. sarmentosum  roxb leaves showed antibacterial activities against e. coli, burkholderia sp. and h. parasuis. ethyl acetate and water extracts from c. domesitca valeton roots showed mic of 306 mug/ml and 183 mug/ml, respectively against only c. perfringens. antioxidative activity was determined by 2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl photometric assay. the methanol extracts of c. aurantifolia swingle fruits and p. sarmentosum roxb leaves showed the highest antioxidant activity among all the extracts with 3.46 mg/ml and 2.70 mg/ml effective concentration 50% (ec50) values, respectively. total contents of phenolics and flavonoids were measured from the plant extracts. methanol extracts of s. grandiflora l. and chloroform extracts of c. domestica valeton were found to have the highest amount of total phenolics, 41.7 and 47.8 mug/ml, respectively. flavonoid content of methanol extracts in s. grandiflora l. t was 22.5 mug/ml and the highest among plant extracts tested. these results indicated that c. aurantifolia swingle, s. grandiflora l., p. sarmentosum roxb, and c. domestica valeton have antibacterial  and antioxidant activities and can be used as alternative antibiotics or potential feed additives for the control of animal pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == porcine group a rotaviruses with heterogeneous vp7 and vp4 genotype combinations  can be found together with enteric bacteria on belgian swine farms.
AB  == group a rotaviruses (rva) are an important cause of diarrhea in young piglets, resulting in significant economic losses. however, the role of rva in the etiology of piglet diarrhea on belgian swine farms was previously unreported. in  the present study, different techniques, including fast antigen detection tests,  virus isolation, rt-pcr and rt-qpcr have been applied for detection of rva in diarrheic (n=28) and asymptomatic (n=6) fecal samples collected on belgian pig farms. rt-qpcr was shown to be most sensitive. routine bacteriological analysis of the fecal samples showed that most diarrheic rva positive samples were also co-infected with one or more bacterial species, such as escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, salmonella sp. and/or brachyspira sp. further genetic characterization of the vp7 and vp4 genes of 26 rva strains resulted in the detection of six different g-genotypes (g2, g3, g4, g5, g9 and g11), and five different p-genotypes (p[6], p[7], p[13], p[23], p[27]), in a total of 12 different g/p combinations. a large intra-genotypic diversity was also apparent.  in conclusion, results of the present study help us better understand the role of rva in the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea, and provide better insights into the  vast genetic diversity present among circulating porcine group a rotaviruses.

TI  == 'core species' in three sources of indoor air belonging to the human micro-environment to the exclusion of outdoor air.
AB  == although we spend the majority of our lives indoors, the airborne microbial content of enclosed spaces still remains inadequately described. the objective of this study was to characterize the bacterial diversity of indoor air in three different enclosed spaces with three levels of occupancy, and, in particular, to  highlight the 'core' species, the opportunistic pathogens and their origins. our  findings provide an overall description of bacterial diversity in these indoor environments. data gathered from the three enclosed spaces revealed the presence  of a common indoor signature (60% of total sequences in common). this work will provide a clearer understanding of the dominant groups of bacteria encountered in enclosed spaces: actinobacteria, proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroidetes. thus, certain evidence revealed a connection between 'core' species and the human micro-environment (20% of phylotypes and 12% of sequences of human origin). overall pca analysis showed that the indoor environment is influenced mainly by the microbial diversity from nose and skin. among the 'core species' found during this study, a large number (72% of all pathogen-related sequences were concentrated in 'core species') of genera and species are known to be responsible for opportunistic or nosocomial diseases or to include human commensal bacteria such as mycobacterium sp., acinetobacter baumanii, aerococcus viridians, thermoactinomyces vulgaris or clostridium perfringens.

TI  == a gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == clostridium difficile infection in horses: a review.
AB  == clostridium difficile is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea  and enterocolitis in horses. foals and adult horses are equally susceptible to the infection. the highly resistant spore of c. difficile is the infectious unit  of transmission, which occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, with sources of infection including equine feces, contaminated soil, animal hospitals, and feces  of other animals. two major risk factors for the development of c. difficile associated disease (cdad) in adult horses are hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment, although sporadically, cases of cdad can occur in horses that have not received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. the most common antibiotics associated with cdad in horses are erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfonamides, beta-lactam antimicrobials, clindamycin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. clinical signs and intestinal lesions of cdad infection are not specific and they cannot be used to distinguish infections by c. difficile from infections by other agents, such as clostridium perfringens or salmonella sp. the distribution of lesions throughout the intestinal tract seems to be age-dependent. small intestine is invariably affected, and colon and cecum may or may not have lesions in foals<1-month old. naturally acquired disease in older foals and adult horses  has a more aboral distribution, affecting colon and sometimes cecum, but rarely the small intestine. detection of toxin a, toxin b or both in intestinal contents or feces is considered the most reliable diagnostic criterion for cdad in horses. isolation of toxigenic strains of c. difficile from horses with intestinal disease is highly suggestive of cdad. a better understanding of pathogenesis, reservoirs of infection, and vaccines and other methods of control is needed. also further studies are recommended to investigate other possible predisposing factors and/or etiological agents of enteric diseases of horses.

TI  == the pathology of enterotoxemia by clostridium perfringens type c in calves.
AB  == the pathology of clostridium perfringens type c infection has been described with detail only in foals and piglets. the current report describes the diagnostic workup and detailed pathology of 3 cases of c. perfringens type c infection in calves. a 2-day-old jersey calf and fresh and fixed tissues from a 4-week-old angus calf and from a 1-week-old jersey calf were received at the california animal health and food safety laboratory system with a history of digestive disease and death. the gross changes in the gastrointestinal tract of 1 calf consisted of multifocal subserosal hemorrhages of the rumen, diffuse congestion and multifocal hemorrhages of the small intestinal mucosa, and dilated cecum with bloody liquid contents. in a second calf, a large segment of small intestine was  hemorrhagic. the small intestine of the third calf was dilated and filled with abundant yellow fluid content. microscopically, all 3 calves had diffuse coagulation necrosis of the intestinal mucosa. clostridium perfringens type a was isolated from the intestinal content of 2 calves. in addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for bovine rotavirus was positive on colonic content of 1 calf. small numbers of cryptosporidia were seen in smears of colonic content of 2 calves, and salmonella sp. group e was detected in the small intestinal content of another calf. clostridium perfringens beta toxin was detected in the intestinal content of the 3 animals. a diagnosis of c. perfringens type c infection was confirmed based on pathological findings and detection of beta toxin in the intestinal content of the 3 animals.

TI  == dynamics of predominant microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract and change in luminal enzymes and immunoglobulin profile during high-altitude adaptation.
AB  == high-altitude (ha) visitors like pilgrims, trackers, scientists and military personnel face a group of nonspecific gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia. in order to investigate the alteration of indigenous gastrointestinal microbiota in the development of such gi symptoms, an experiment was conducted for the enumeration of dominant cultivable faecal microbiota of 15 soldiers at base level (delhi) and during their 15-day acclimatization at 3,505 m ha (leh). at ha, faecal microbiota analysis revealed that total aerobes decreased significantly with increase of total and facultative anaerobes. the strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroidetes sp. and lactobacillus sp. exhibited positive growth direction index (gdi) like other predominant obligate anaerobes clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. different enzymes like amylase, proteinase and polyphenol hydrolase produced by different bacterial populations showed positive gdi, whereas phosphatase producers exhibited negative gdi. the levels of microbe-originated enzymes like amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated during ha acclimatization. in addition, in vitro gas production ability  was enhanced with increase of faecal immunoglobulins iga and igg. we demonstrated that hypoxic environment at ha had the potential to alter the gut microbial composition and its activities that may cause gi dysfunctions.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of the cspb protease required for clostridium  spore germination.
AB  == spores are the major transmissive form of the nosocomial pathogen clostridium difficile, a leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea worldwide. successful transmission of c. difficile requires that its hardy, resistant spores germinate into vegetative cells in the gastrointestinal tract. a critical step during this process is the degradation of the spore cortex, a thick layer of peptidoglycan surrounding the spore core. in clostridium sp., cortex degradation  depends on the proteolytic activation of the cortex hydrolase, slec. previous studies have implicated csps as being necessary for slec cleavage during germination; however, their mechanism of action has remained poorly characterized. in this study, we demonstrate that cspb is a subtilisin-like serine protease whose activity is essential for efficient slec cleavage and c. difficile spore germination. by solving the first crystal structure of a csp family member, cspb, to 1.6 a, we identify key structural domains within cspb. in contrast with all previously solved structures of prokaryotic subtilases, the cspb prodomain remains tightly bound to the wildtype subtilase domain and sterically occludes a catalytically competent active site. the structure, combined with biochemical and genetic analyses, reveals that csp proteases contain a unique jellyroll domain insertion critical for stabilizing the protease in vitro and in c. difficile. collectively, our study provides the first molecular insight into cspb activity and function. these studies may inform the development of inhibitors that can prevent clostridial spore germination and thus disease transmission.

TI  == enzymatic depolymerization of gum tragacanth: bifidogenic potential of low molecular weight oligosaccharides.
AB  == gum tragacanth derived from the plant "goat's horn" (astragalus sp.) has a long history of use as a stabilizing, viscosity-enhancing agent in food emulsions. the gum contains pectinaceous arabinogalactans and fucose-substituted xylogalacturonans. in this work, gum tragacanth from astragalus gossypinus was enzymatically depolymerized using aspergillus niger pectinases (pectinex be color). the enzymatically degraded products were divided into three molecular weight fractions via membrane separation: hag1 < 2 kda; 2 kda < hag2 < 10 kda; hag3 > 10 kda. compositional and linkage analyses showed that these three fractions also varied with respect to composition and structural elements: hag1 and hag2 were enriched in arabinose, galactose, and galacturonic acid, but low in fucose and xylose, whereas hag3 was high in (terminal) xylose, fucose, and 1,4-bonded galacturonic acid, but low in arabinose and galactose content. the growth-stimulating potential of the three enzymatically produced gum tragacanth fractions was evaluated via growth assessment on seven different probiotic strains in single-culture fermentations on bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (two strains), b. longum subsp. infantis (three strains), lactobacillus acidophilus , b. lactis, and on one pathogenic strain of clostridium perfringens  . the fractions hag1 and hag2 consistently promoted higher growth of the probiotic strains than hag3, especially of the three b. longum subsp. infantis strains, and the growth promotion on hag1 and hag2 was better than that on galactan (control). hag3 completely inhibited the growth of the c. perfringens strain. tragacanth gum is thus a potential source of prebiotic carbohydrates that exert no viscosity effects and which may find use as natural functional food ingredients.

AB  == clostridial myositis is an acute, generally fatal toxemia that is considered to be rare in pet animals. the present report describes an unusual canine clostridial myositis that was diagnosed by a new multiplex-pcr (mpcr) designed for simultaneous identification of clostridium sordellii, clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens type a, clostridium chauvoei, and clostridium novyi type  a. a ten-month-old male rottweiler dog, that had displayed lameness and swelling  of the left limb for 12 h, was admitted to a veterinary hospital. the animal was  weak, dyspneic and hyperthermic, and a clinical examination indicated the presence of gas and edema in the limb. despite emergency treatment, the animal died in only a few minutes. samples of muscular tissue from the necrotic area were aseptically collected and plated onto defibrinated sheep blood agar (5%) in  anaerobic conditions. colonies suggestive of clostridium spp. were submitted to testing by multiplex-pcr. impression smears of the tissues, visualized with gram  and also with panoptic stains, revealed long rod-shaped organisms, and specimens  also tested positive using the fluorescent antibody technique (fat). the fat and  mpcr tests enabled a diagnosis of c. septicum myonecrosis in the dog.

TI  == testing of veterinary clostridial vaccines: from mouse to microtitre plate.
AB  == vaccines to protect against clostridial diseases are among the most common veterinary biologicals. each batch of these materials is subjected to a variety of toxicity and antigenicity tests. the potency of the final vaccine is then assessed by toxin neutralisation test (tnt). all of these tests use mice and have lethal endpoints. development of alternatives for potency testing was based on elisas able to measure antibody levels to the specific toxins relative to a standard serum with a defined unitage. these alternative assays were shown to correlate with the relevant tnts and have been accepted by european regulatory authorities as batch release potency tests. recently we have developed in vitro cell line alternatives for the toxicity and antigenicity tests for cl. septicum using the vero cell line. with this cell line it has been possible to develop in  vitro assays which, when compared with the in vivo tests, gave correlations of 87% to 100%. having shown proof of principle, similar cell line assays have been  developed for cl. novyi and cl. perfringens types c and d.

TI  == bacterial contamination of tile drainage water and shallow groundwater under different application methods of liquid swine manure.
AB  == a 2 year field experiment evaluated liquid manure application methods on the movement of manure-borne pathogens (salmonella sp.) and indicator bacteria (escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens) to subsurface water. a combination of application methods including surface application, pre-application tillage, and post-application incorporation were applied in a randomized complete block design on an instrumented field site in spring 2007 and 2008. tile and shallow groundwater were sampled immediately after manure application and after rainfall  events. bacterial enumeration from water samples showed that the surface-applied  manure resulted in the highest concentration of e. coli in tile drainage water. pre-tillage significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the movement of manure-based e. coli and c. perfringens to tile water and to shallow groundwater within 3 days after manure application (dam) in 2008 and within 10 dam in 2007. pre-tillage also decreased the occurrence of salmonella sp. in tile water samples. indicator bacteria and pathogens reached nondetectable levels within 50 dam. the results suggest that tillage before application of liquid swine manure can minimize the movement of bacteria to tile and groundwater, but is effective only for the drainage events immediately after manure application or initial rainfall-associated drainage flows. furthermore, the study highlights the strong  association between bacterial concentrations in subsurface waters and rainfall timing and volume after manure application.

TI  == comparison of methods for the enumeration of clostridium perfringens spores in water.
AB  == four methods for enumerating clostridium perfringens spores in water were evaluated: (1) the imm (iron milk medium) method (mpn); (2) the ls (lactose sulfite broth) method (mpn); (3) the m-cp (membrane filtration clostridium perfringens agar) method (membrane filtration); and (4) the tsc (tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar) method (membrane filtration). the performance of these methods  was compared with that of the drcm (differential reinforced clostridium medium) method (mpn) as adopted by cetesb (brazil's environmental sanitation technology company) for the analysis of c. perfringens spores in water. statistical analysis was performed according to iso 17994:2004 (water quality - criteria for establishing equivalence between microbiological methods). the ls, m-cp, and tsc  methods were considered not equivalent to the drcm method, as they gave significantly lower results. the imm showed inconclusive results and, according to iso 17994:2004, analysis of a greater number of samples is needed to draw definitive conclusions comparing imm and drcm.

TI  == microbial community analysis and identification of alternative host-specific fecal indicators in fecal and river water samples using pyrosequencing.
AB  == it is important to know the comprehensive microbial communities of fecal pollution sources and receiving water bodies for microbial source tracking. pyrosequencing targeting the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene was used to investigate the characteristics of bacterial and bacteroidales communities in major fecal sources and river waters. diversity analysis indicated that cow feces had the highest diversities in the bacterial and bacteroidales group followed by the pig sample, with human feces having the lowest value. the bacteroidales, one of the potential fecal indicators, totally dominated in the fecal samples accounting for 31%-52% of bacterial sequences, but much less (0.6%) in the river water. clustering and venn diagram analyses showed that the human sample had a greater similarity to the pig sample in the bacterial and bacteroidales communities than to samples from other hosts. traditional fecal indicators, i.e., escherichia coli, were detected in the human and river water samples at very low rates and clostridium perfringens and enterococci were not detected in any samples. besides the bacteroidales group, some microorganisms detected in the specific hosts, i.e., parasutterella excrementihominis, veillonella sp., dialister invisus, megamonas funiformis, and ruminococcus lactaris for the human and lactobacillus amylovorus and atopostipes sp. for the pig, could be used as potential host-specific fecal indicators. these microorganisms could be used as multiple fecal indicators that are not dependent  on the absence or presence of a single indicator. monitoring for multiple indicators that are highly abundant and host-specific would greatly enhance the effectiveness of fecal pollution source tracking.

TI  == functional insight into the c-terminal extension of halolysin spta from haloarchaeon natrinema sp. j7.
AB  == halolysin spta from haloarchaeon natrinema sp. j7 consists of a subtilisin-like catalytic domain and a c-terminal extension (cte) containing two cysteine residues. in this report, we have investigated the function of the cte using recombinant enzymes expressed in haloferax volcanii wfd11. deletion of the cte greatly reduced but did not abolish protease activity, which suggests that the cte is not essential for enzyme folding. mutational analysis suggests that residues cys303 and cys338 within the cte form a disulfide bond that make this domain resistant to autocleavage and proteolysis under hypotonic conditions. characterization of full-length and cte-truncation enzymes indicates the cte not  only confers extra stability to the enzyme but also assists enzyme activity on protein substrates by facilitating binding at high salinities. interestingly, homology modeling of the cte yields a beta-jelly roll-like structure similar to those seen in claudin-binding domain of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (clostridial c-cpe) and collagen binding domain (cbd), and the cte also possesses collagen-binding activity, making it a potential candidate as an anchoring unit in drug delivery systems.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

AB  == the aim of this study was to describe parasitological, microbiological, and pathological findings associated with the isolation of aspergillus species in 94  clinically diseased captive falcons from dubai. concomitant agents and/or diseases were identified in 64 cases, causing either single (n = 36) or multiple  coinfections (n = 28). diagnoses found more often in association with aspergillosis were chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (cfids) (n = 29), caryospora sp. (n = 16), serratospiculum seurati infestation (n = 14), cestodiasis (n = 6), bumblefoot (n = 5), trematodosis due to strigea falconispalumbi (n = 5), trichomoniasis (n = 4), babesia shortti (n = 4), mannheimia (pastorella) haemolytica (n = 4), interstitial hepatitis (n = 4), escherichia coli (n = 3), and clostridium perfringens enterotoxemia (n = 2). compared with a control group of 2000 diseased falcons without evidence of aspergillosis, the prevalence of babesia shortti, cfids, mannheimia (pastorella)  haemolytica, escherichia coli, and falcon herpes virus infection was conspicuously higher in association with aspergillosis. these entities may be considered suitable candidates as predisposing factors for the mycosis.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == quality of water sources used as drinking water in a brazilian peri-urban area.
AB  == the objective of this paper was to assess bacteriological quality of drinking water in a peri-urban area located in the metropolitan region of sao paulo, brazil. a total of 89 water samples were collected from community plastic tanks and 177 water samples from wells were collected bimonthly, from september 2007 to november 2008, for evaluating bacteriological parameters including: escherichia coli, enterococcus and heterotrophic plate count (hpc). clostridium perfringens was investigated in a subsample (40 samples from community plastic tank and 40 from wells). e. coli was present in 5 (5.6%) samples from community plastic tanks (2.0 - 5.1x10(4) mpn/100ml) and in 70 (39.5%) well samples (2.0 - 8.6x10(4) mpn/100ml). thus, these samples were not in accordance with the brazilian regulation. enterococcus was detected in 20 (22.5%) samples of the community plastic tanks (1 to 79 nc/100ml) and in 142 (80.2%) well samples (1 to >200 nc/100ml). c. perfringens was detected in 5 (12.5%) community plastic tanks samples and in 35 (87.5%) wells samples (2.2 to >16 mpn/100ml). hpc were above 500 cfu/ml in 5 (5.6%) waters from community plastic tanks. in wells samples, the hpc ranged from <1 to 1.6x10(4) cfu/ml. the residual chlorine did not attend the  standard established in the drinking water legislation (0.2 mg/l), except in 20 (22.5%) samples. these results confirm the vulnerability of the water supply systems in this peri-urban area what is clearly a public health concern.

TI  == safety and efficacy of a maternal vaccine for the passive protection of broiler chicks against necrotic enteritis.
AB  == necrotic enteritis is a potentially fatal multifactorial disease of chickens, which under commercial conditions is often associated with increased levels of mortality and reduced bird performance. the safety and efficacy of a clostridium  perfringens type a alpha-toxoid (netvax) formulated as an oil emulsion was investigated, following maternal immunization of broiler breeder hens, housed under commercial conditions, by the intramuscular route. a total of 11,234 hens were vaccinated across two integrated poultry sites. the vaccine was safe with no systemic reactions or adverse effects on bird performance detected. vaccination resulted in a significant increase in anti-alpha toxin antibody in the hen that was maintained throughout the study, and subsequently transferred to their progeny throughout the laying period via egg yolk. chicks hatched from eggs produced from vaccinated hens were shown to have reduced mortality specifically related to progeny flocks where gross gut lesions associated with necrotic enteritis were observed in control chicks. further, whilst c. perfringens was isolated from control chicks with necrotic enteritis lesions, no such isolations  were made at these time points from chicks from vaccinated hens. these results indicate that, under commercial conditions, maternal vaccination with netvax can  help to control losses related to necrotic enteritis.

AB  == strain nrrl b-23883(t) was isolated from retail ground beef as part of a study on the genetic diversity of clostridium perfringens. the strain was found to be a strictly anaerobic, gram-positive coccus that was able to utilize peptone as a sole carbon source. analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed that the strain was closely related to species within the genera peptoniphilus and anaerosphaera, but it was substantially different from the closest recognized species by nearly 10 % sequence divergence. the strain was also found to be closely related (>99 % sequence similarity) to an uncultured bacterial strain that was sequenced from a 16s rrna gene clone library constructed to characterize the bacterial community of faeces from a captive spotted hyena. strain nrrl b-23883(t) shared the peptidoglycan type a4beta, l-orn-d-glu with members of the  genus peptoniphilus. further phenotypic analysis revealed that strain nrrl b-23883(t) was able to utilize glycyl l-methionine as a sole carbon source, in contrast to other species of the genus peptoniphilus. therefore, it is proposed that the isolate represents a novel species, peptoniphilus methioninivorax sp. nov.; the type strain is nrrl b-23883(t) ( = dsm 22461(t)).

TI  == noncollagenous region of the streptococcal collagen-like protein is a trimerization domain that supports refolding of adjacent homologous and heterologous collagenous domains.
AB  == proper folding of the (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence of animal collagens requires adjacent n- or c-terminal noncollagenous trimerization domains which often contain coiled-coil or beta sheet structure. collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. the scl2 collagen-like protein from streptococcus pyogenes has an n-terminal globular domain, designated v(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. the v(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the scl2 protein in  vitro. here, recombinant v(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of t(m) = 45 degrees c. examination of a new construct shows that the v(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located n-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when c-terminal to the triple-helix domain. fusion of the v(sp) domain n-terminal to a heterologous (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence from clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on  its own. these results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous gly-xaa-yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases but also shows specificity in the relative location  of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. this information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.

TI  == expanding the family of collagen proteins: recombinant bacterial collagens of varying composition form triple-helices of similar stability.
AB  == the presence of the (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) open reading frames in different bacteria predicts the existence of an expanded family of collagen-like proteins. to further explore the triple-helix motif and stabilization mechanisms in the absence of hydroxyproline (hyp), predicted novel collagen-like proteins from gram-positive and -negative bacteria were expressed in escherichia coli and characterized. soluble proteins capable of successful folding and in vitro refolding were observed for collagen proteins from methylobacterium sp 4-46, rhodopseudomonas palustris and solibacter usitatus . in contrast, all protein constructs from clostridium perfringens were found predominantly in inclusion bodies. however, attachment of a heterologous n-terminal or c-terminal noncollagenous folding domain induced the clostridium perfringens collagen domain to fold and become soluble. the soluble constructs from different bacteria had typical collagen triple-helical features and showed surprisingly similar thermal  stabilities despite diverse amino acid compositions. these collagen-like proteins provide a resource for the development of biomaterials with new properties.

TI  == case of clostridium perfringens bacteremia after routine colonoscopy and polypectomy.
AB  == bacteremia is an uncommon complication after polypectomy and colonoscopy. we report one of the first cases of clostridium perfringens bacteremia after polypectomy. our patient was a four years old boy with congenital polyposis, who  underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy without complication. approximately 12h later he developed a fever and tachycardia with no other clinical symptoms. his blood cultures grew out penicillin susceptible c. perfringens and enterococcus faecalis. he responded to antibiotic therapy and remained clinically asymptomatic for the duration of his course. there are a few reports of bacteremia after routine polypectomy, but no reported cases of c. perfringens bacteremia in the pediatric population. clostridial sp. bacteremia can be fatal with devastating consequences if appropriate antibiotics and/or surgical debridement are delayed.  polymicrobial infection, as illustrated in our patient, is also common and can be a poor prognostic risk factor. therefore, for patients with a history of polypectomy and new onset fever, anaerobic infections should be considered and empiric antibiotic therapy should include coverage for these organisms.

AB  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is one of the primary etiologic agents for diarrhea in neonatal calves. immunization of dams can provide passive protection  in neonatal calves; antibodies transferred through colostrum block colonization of bacteria, thereby preventing disease. in this study, healthy pregnant heifers  were vaccinated at approximately 3 months of gestation with either a polyvalent oil-adjuvanted vaccine containing inactivated coronavirus, rotavirus, e. coli k99 subunit antigen, and clostridium perfringens b and e toxoid or normal saline as a placebo. calves were allowed to nurse immediately after birth, were orally challenged with virulent heterologous enterotoxigenic e. coli at 1 day of age, and were observed for clinical signs of scours for 10 days. signs of severe scours were noted in 75% of control calves and 28.6% of vaccinates, and the severity of scours was significantly higher (p = .0382) in the control group. the mortality rate was significantly higher (p = .0007) in the control group (80%) than in the vaccinate group (14%). these findings indicate that the vaccination of pregnant heifers at as early as 3 months of gestation (6 months before calving) provides passive protection in neonatal calves against colibacillosis.

TI  == regional differences in bacterial flora in harbour porpoises from the north atlantic: environmental effects?
AB  == aims: microbiological findings in harbour porpoises from different regions of the north atlantic were compared. results in animals from the north and baltic seas were evaluated over a period of 18 years for changes in the microbiological flora. methods and results: microbiological investigations were performed on 1429 organ samples from the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes from harbour porpoises of the german north and baltic seas, greenlandic, icelandic and norwegian waters. a large variety of bacteria, including potentially pathogenic bacteria like brucella sp., clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, beta-haemolytic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated. those bacteria were associated with bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis, myocarditis and septicemia. conclusions: organs from animals originating from greenlandic and icelandic waters showed clearly less bacterial growth and fewer associated pathological lesions compared to animals from the german north and baltic seas and norwegian waters. significance and impact of the study: differences in bacterial findings and associated lesions between harbour porpoises from the german north and baltic seas and animals from greenlandic, norwegian and icelandic waters may result from higher stress due to anthropogenic activities such as chemical pollutants in the north and baltic seas.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == assessment of faecal contamination and the relationship between pathogens and faecal bacterial indicators in an estuarine environment (seine, france).
AB  == the seine estuary, one of the largest estuaries of the european northwest continental shelf, is subjected to numerous anthropogenic influences. here we present an assessment of the microbial faecal contamination of the estuary water. the most vulnerable areas were defined on the basis of the fluxes of indicator organisms and the occurrence of salmonella and cryptosporidium sp. and giardia sp. (oo)cysts. the microbial quality of the water changes from upstream to downstream: in the upstream area, contamination by faecal-indicator bacteria and  salmonella occurs during periods of high flow; in the urbanized area, mid-way between the uppermost areas of the estuary and its mouth, discharge from a wastewater treatment plant and a tributary degrade water quality; at the estuary  mouth, the accumulation of microorganisms attached to particles in the maximum turbidity zone, particularly clostridium perfringens spores and oocysts of cryptosporidium, is accompanied by inputs of thc and escherichia coli from tributaries. in some areas, significant strong relations are observed between salmonella, (oo)cysts of protozoan, and levels of faecal indicators.

AB  == in order to reduce the toxicity of clostridium perfringens fermentation broths used in vaccine preparation, we developed two-phase aqueous systems for removal of toxin-activating proteases. removal of the proteases inhibits the conversion of protoxin to active toxin. in order to establish the conditions under which the phase separation occurs, binodal curves, formed by poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) and sodium citrate, were investigated at different values of ph and peg molar mass. a 2(4)-experimental design was used to evaluate the influence of peg molar  mass and concentration, citrate concentration and ph on protease partition coefficient, removal.factor and protease removal yield. it has been found that simultaneous increase in peg molar mass and decrease in citrate concentration remarkably improved the removal factor, whereas the protease removal yield showed an opposite trend. the best conditions for the system under consideration (removal factor of 2.69 and yield of 116%) were obtained at ph 8.0 using peg molar mass of 8000 g mol(-1) and concentrations of peg and citrate of 24 and 15%, respectively.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == congener specific polychlorinated biphenyl metabolism by human intestinal microbe species: comparison with human liver cell line-hepg2.
AB  == polychlorobiphenyls (pcbs), which adversely affect human fetal and infant development, are endocrine disrupter and cause neurological disorders. they may also be carcinogenic. it is not known whether these effects are due to whole pcbs or to its metabolites, produced by the human gastrointestinal system primarily the liver and/or by intestinal microbes such as clostridium sp. the available data show that clostridium perfringens, the most prominent species of clostridium occurs in the human gut. c. beijerinckii is a special type of clostridium present in the gut of autistic children with late onset autism. since mixed cultures are  better pcb metabolizers than single cultures, mixed cultures of clostridium were  used in this work. the first step in pcb degradation is the removal of the chlorine atoms and then the breaking open of the phenyl ring leading to the final degradation product: co2. in this study, gc-ms analyses were done to examine the  effect of clostridium sp. on pcb-153 and pcb-77 and the metabolites obtained with clostridium sp. therein. in this paper, we report that the unlike human liver cells which cannot produce any pcb metabolites. mixed clostridium spp. can degrade these pcbs. clostridium spp. and were able to dechlorinate pcb 153 (hexachlorobiphenyl) to pentachlorobiphenyl and pcb 77 (tetrachlorobiphenyl) to trichlorobiphenyl. despite considerable absorption of pcb 153 (40%) and pcb 77 (50%) in 30 minutes and 1.5 hours respectively by human liver (hepg2) cells, they can not dechlorinate pcbs. it has been observed that slight differences in chemical structures of pcbs such as coplanar (pcb-77) vs. non-coplanar (pcb-153)  has significant metabolic effects.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == giardia and cryptosporidium in source waters of sao paulo state, brazil.
AB  == giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium parvum are two protozoan intestinal parasites responsible for many drinking-water-related disease outbreaks in recent years. they are very resistant to conventional water treatment processes, can persist for long times in the environment and are, therefore, of great concern for public health. this work aimed to evaluate the presence of giardia and cryptosporidium in water sources from sao paulo state, brazil, as part of the "evaluation of inland waters from sao paulo state" project from cetesb. over a period of 19 months, 278 water samples from 28 sites located in 10 watersheds were analysed. the immunofluorescence assay was used after concentration of the samples by the calcium carbonate flocculation technique. thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms, faecal streptococci and clostridium perfringens were also determined in order to  verify the existence of correlation between these bacterial indicators and the protozoa. giardia and cryptosporidium were detected in 27% and 2.5% of the samples, respectively, a lower figure compared with the results reported by other authors, especially for cryptosporidium. a spearman rank correlation test demonstrated a significant correlation between giardia and faecal indicator concentrations. according to the american regulation of monitoring (icr), treated water from 16 of these 28 collection sites should also be analysed to evaluate whether the treatment process could remove the parasites. some technical deficiencies of these methods still limit the utilisation of the monitoring results for public health decisions, but the data here reported will help to improve the quality of drinking water in sao paulo state.

AB  == two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of a beta-mannanase feed enzyme on the performance of broiler chicks subject to a necrotic enteritis disease challenge model involving oral inoculation of eimeria sp. and clostridium pefringens. beta-mannanase is known to improve productive performance when added  to poultry and swine diets. in both experiments, disease challenge in the absence of feed additives demonstrated significant reductions in performance as measured  by weight gain, feed conversion, and the incidence of coccidial lesion scores. significant mortality was also observed in challenged groups in experiment 1. the disease challenge model was therefore judged as highly effective. additions of a  commonly used antibiotic, bacitracin methylene disalicilate (bmd), and coccidiostat, salinomycin, were highly effective in partially counteracting negative effects of the disease challenge. in both experiments, addition of beta-mannanase significantly improved performance and reduced lesion scores in disease-challenged groups. the degree of improvement was somewhat less than that  afforded by a combination of bmd and salinomycin in experiment 1 but was not different from that afforded by bmd alone in experiment 2. we conclude that the beta-mannanase enzyme can play a role in circumstances where the use of antibiotics is not desired.

TI  == involvement of tachykinin receptors in clostridium perfringens beta-toxin-induced plasma extravasation.
AB  == 1 clostridium perfringens beta-toxin causes dermonecrosis and oedema in the dorsal skin of animals. in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of oedema induced by the toxin. 2 the toxin induced plasma extravasation in the dorsal skin of balb/c mice. 3 the extravasation was significantly inhibited by diphenhydramine, a histamine 1 receptor antagonist. however, the toxin did not cause the release of histamine from mouse mastocytoma cells. 4 tachykinin nk(1) receptor antagonists, [d-pro(2), d-trp(7,9)]-sp, [d-pro(4), d-trp(7,9)]-sp and spantide, inhibited the toxin-induced leakage in a dose-dependent manner. furthermore, the non-peptide tachykinin nk(1) receptor antagonist, sr140333, markedly inhibited the toxin-induced leakage. 5 the leakage induced by the toxin  was markedly reduced in capsaicin-pretreated mouse skin but the leakage was not affected by systemic pretreatment with a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist (cgrp(8-37)). 6 the toxin-induced leakage was significantly inhibited  by the n-type ca(2+) channel blocker, omega-conotoxin mviia, and the bradykinin b(2) receptor antagonist, hoe140 (d-arg-[hyp(3), thi(5), d-tic(7), oic(8)]-bradykinin), but was not affected by the selective l-type ca(2+) channel  blocker, verapamil, the p-type ca(2+) channel blocker, omega-agatoxin iva, tetrodotoxin (ttx), the ttx-resistant na(+) channel blocker, carbamazepine, or the sensory nerve conduction blocker, lignocaine. 7 these results suggest that plasma extravasation induced by beta-toxin in mouse skin is mediated via a mechanism involving tachykinin nk(1) receptors.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == regrowth and survival of indicator microorganisms on the surfaces of household containers used for the storage of drinking water in rural communities of south africa.
AB  == the present study covered two rural communities of south africa: ncera and ntselamanzi villages. raw water from ncera river is used by the community of ncera village for drinking, while the community of ntselamanzi receives their drinking water from alice purification system. treated water is supplied to the community by a public standpipe system. in rural communities of south africa, many households use polyethylene (pe) and galvanized steel (gs) containers for the storage of their drinking water. to investigate the regrowth and survival of  indicator microorganisms on the surface of household containers during the storage of drinking water, pe and gs slides were suspended in the appropriate household containers for a period of 48 h. this period of 48 h was chosen as the  study period because results from the questionnaire indicated that the largest percentage (62%) of households store their water for that length of time. the experiment was performed to test drinking water as it is collected and stored by  rural communities. no disinfection of household containers or slides was done during the study period. attached coliphages (f-rna (fp) and somatic phage (sp),  coliform bacteria (total coliform (tc), presumptive escherichia coli (ec), salmonella (sal) and clostridium perfringens (cp) were measured during the study  period. with the exception of cp, attached indicator microorganisms consisted of  tc, presumptive e. coli and salmonella, somatic and f-rna coliphages, although the yield (average count) for the last four groups (ec: < 1-3 cfu cm(-2), sal: <  1-15 cfu cm(-2), fp: < 1-7 pfu cm(-2), sp: < 1-7pfu cm(-2)) was lower than that of tc (3-183 cfu cm(-2)). however, the lowest yield of indicator microorganisms was noted for presumptive e. coli. whereas the occurrence and survival of tc was  noted on the surface of household containers during the entire period of the experimental study, other indicator microorganisms occurred from time to time. the regrowth of indicator microorganisms occurred 48 h after the exposure of slides to both types of test waters. this length of time mostly resulted in the regrowth of tc (with an increase in bacterial counts) while the persistence of other indicator organism groups on the surface of the slides was apparent. a comparison between pe and gs containers showed that more tc (average count) regrew on pe than on gs containers (for river water, pe: from 36 to 55 cfu cm(-2), gs: from 25 to 26 cfu cm(-2); for standpipe water, pe: from 147 to 183 cfu cm(-2), gs from 3 to 4 cfu cm(-2)). this study revealed that both types of household containers supported the growth and survival of indicator microorganisms due to the bad quality of the intake water before storage. the storage of drinking water for 48 h mainly resulted in the regrowth of tc. nevertheless, the persistence of other indicator microorganisms was observed on the surface of household containers.

TI  == sulfate-reducing bacteria colonize pouches formed for ulcerative colitis but not  for familial adenomatous polyposis.
AB  == purpose: ileal pouch-anal anastomosis remains the "gold standard" in surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. pouchitis occurs mainly in patients with a background of ulcerative colitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. the aim of this study was to characterize differences in pouch bacterial populations between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous pouches. methods: after ethical approval was obtained, fresh stool samples were collected from patients with ulcerative colitis pouches (n = 10), familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 7) pouches, and ulcerative colitis ileostomies (n = 8). quantitative measurements of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  were performed. results: sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from 80 percent  (n = 8) of ulcerative colitis pouches. sulfate-reducing bacteria were absent from familial adenomatous polyposis pouches and also from ulcerative colitis ileostomy effluent. pouch lactobacilli, bifidobacterium, bacteroides sp, and clostridium perfringens counts were increased relative to ileostomy counts in patients with ulcerative colitis. total pouch enterococci and coliform counts were also increased relative to ileostomy levels. there were no significant quantitative or qualitative differences between pouch types when these bacteria were evaluated. conclusions: sulfate-reducing bacteria are exclusive to patients with a background of ulcerative colitis. not all ulcerative colitis pouches harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria because two ulcerative colitis pouches in this study were free of the latter. they are not present in familial adenomatous polyposis pouches or in ileostomy effluent collected from patients with ulcerative colitis. total bacterial counts increase in ulcerative colitis pouches after stoma closure. levels of lactobacilli, bifidobacterium, bacteroides sp, clostridium perfringens, enterococci, and coliforms were similar in both pouch groups. because sulfate-reducing bacteria are specific to ulcerative colitis pouches, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.

TI  == co-processing of organic fraction of municipal solid waste and primary sludge--stabilization and disinfection.
AB  == batch mesophilic digesters were fed a mixture of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (of-msw) and primary sludge (ps), and operated under non-mixing condition at a 30-day influent mass retention time. the reactors were  started in a slurry mode and brought to the target level of 26-30% total solids in about 3 months from start. two feed characteristics, the level of ps solids in the feed, and the particle size of the of-msw, were the variables used to determine their effect on methane production during digester operation. higher biodegradable volatile solid reductions and methane yields matched increased fractions of primary sludge in the feed (5%, 10%, and 15% as dry solids). incomplete digestion, limited to fermentation, took place in reactors that did not receive primary sludge. the particle size did not have any effect on specific weight of the feed but the amount of primary sludge did. addition of vitamins and micronutrients to the inhibited reactors did not stimulate methane production, which narrowed the range of possible causes to the lack of available macronutrients, namely nitrogen. on the other hand, possible un-ionized ammonia (nh3) inhibition of reactors fed with the highest primary sludge-amended feed hindered organic conversion rates. elimination of pathogenic microorganisms from  the high-solids residue via long-term storage, followed by low-dose lime disinfection, was also investigated. storage alone reduced fecal coliform and salmonella sp. bacteria to below detection, but bacterial spores of anaerobic clostridium perfringens survived. subsequent liming of the residue caused irreversible inactivation of the spores because of high ph and, possibly, free ammonia (nh3) inherent to sludge.

TI  == expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. this process is attributed to  enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the presence of clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56  intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. methods: a total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. these 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-d glucuronide as substrate. results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. results: c. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for e coli, staphylococcus, corynebacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., streptococcus sp., and klebsiella sp. conclusion: c. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than e coli and klebsiella sp.

TI  == differentiation of clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum from non-toxigenic clostridia, isolated from prepared and frozen foods by pcr-dan based methods.
AB  == during the elaboration process of prepared and frozen foods, clostridium sp. have been reported. from those microorganisms, c. perfringens and c. botulinum may pose a high risk for the consumers. to avoid these pathogenic organisms an haccp  program should be implemented, but in addition sensitive and moderately time consuming microbiological methods for monitoring c. perfringens and c. boulinum should be established. in this work, an rflp analysis of the 16s rdna will be developed to differentiate c. perfringens from other clostridium sp. in addition, a pcr protocol, will be assayed to detect c. botulinum. both two methods will be  compared with biochemical characterization by api system. the restriction analysis of the 16s rdna with taq i and rsa i showed at least the same sensitivity to differentiate c. perfringens from clostridial isolates as biochemical identification. however, the former method takes only 8-10 h of analysis as compared with 24-48 h required for biochemical characterization. with the specific pcr protocol to detect c. botulinum a band of 1.1 kbp was obtained derived from the specific amplification of bont genes, taking 6-8 h for analysis. both two molecular dna based methods should be considered as verification techniques of pathogenic clostridia in the haccp program.

TI  == spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == sequence analysis of bacterial dna in the colon and stomach of the tyrolean iceman.
AB  == the male human body found in an alpine glacier on september 19, 1991 ("tyrolean iceman") has, for the first time in history, given scientists a chance to perform detailed anatomical, histological, and molecular investigations on the organs of  a person from the neolithic age (5350-5100 b.p.). in the present study, tissue samples aseptically taken from the stomach and the colon of the mummy were utilized for dna extraction, and the dna was pcr-amplified, using primer pairs designed to bind to fragments of the 16s ribosomal rna gene (16s rdna) of a broad range of bacteria. the pcr products were cloned in plasmid vectors, and the recombinant clones (amplicons) were sequenced. the sequence data were finally used for scanning data libraries containing the corresponding sequences of present-day bacteria, to infer the putative ecophysiology of the ancient ones. the same procedure was repeated on some fragments of grass from the clothing found near the corpse. these fragments were taken as a control of the microbiological situation of the glacier. the results show that the flora of the  iceman's stomach is entirely composed of burkholderia pickettii, an organism commonly found in aquatic habitats. the colon, on the other hand, contains several members of the fecal flora of humans, such as clostridium perfringens, c. ghonii, c. sordellii, eubacterium tenue, and bacteroides sp. the iceman's colon,  however, was found to contain, rather unexpectedly, also some members of the genus vibrio. the results are discussed in light of what is known about the preservation of microbial dna at the iceman's site and of previous parasitological studies performed on the iceman himself and on human coprolites.

AB  == the extent of reduction in selected microorganisms was tested during both aerobic wastewater treatment and anaerobic digestion of sludge at the wastewater treatment plant in ottawa to compare the removal of two encysted pathogenic protozoa with that of microbial indicators. samples collected included the raw wastewater, the primary effluent, the treated wastewater, the mixed sludge, the decanted liquor, and the cake. all of the raw sewage samples were positive for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts, as well as for the other microorganisms tested. during aerobic wastewater treatment (excluding the anaerobic sludge digestion), cryptosporidium and giardia were reduced by 2.96 log10 and 1.40 log10, respectively. clostridium perfringens spores, clostridium perfringens total counts, somatic coliphages, and heterotrophic bacteria were reduced by approximately 0.89 log10, 0.96 log10, 1.58 log10, and 2.02 log10, respectively. all of the other microorganisms were reduced by at least 3.53 log10. sludge samples from the plant were found to contain variable densities of  microorganisms. variability in microbial concentrations was sometimes great between samples, stressing the importance of collecting a large number of samples over a long period of time. in all cases, the bacterial concentrations in the cake (dewatered biosolids) samples were high even if reductions in numbers were observed with some bacteria. during anaerobic sludge digestion, no statistically  significant reduction was observed for clostridium perfringens, enterococcus sp., cryptosporidium oocysts, and giardia cysts. a 1-2 log10 reduction was observed with fecal coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria. however, the method utilized to  detect the protozoan parasites does not differentiate between viable and nonviable organisms. on the other hand, total coliforms and somatic coliphages were reduced by 0.35 log10 and 0.09 log10, respectively. these results demonstrate the relative persistence of the protozoa in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment.

TI  == characterization, production, and purification of leucocin h, a two-peptide bacteriocin from leuconostoc mf215b.
AB  == leuconostoc mf215b was found to produce a two-peptide bacteriocin referred to as  leucocin h. the two peptides were termed leucocin halpha and leucocin hbeta. when acting together, they inhibit, among others, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens. production of leucocin h in growth medium takes place at temperatures down to 6 degrees c and at ph below 7. the highest activity of leucocin h in growth medium was demonstrated in the late exponential  growth phase. the bacteriocin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange (sp sepharose) and reverse phase chromatography. upon purification, specific activity increased 10(5)-fold, and the final specific activity was 2 x 10(7) bu/od280. amino acid composition analyses of leucocin halpha and leucocin hbeta indicated that both peptides consisted of around 40 amino acid residues. their n-termini were blocked for edman degradation, and the  methionin residues of leucocin hbeta did not respond to cyanogen bromide (cnbr) cleavage. absorbance at 280 nm indicated the presence of tryptophan residues and  tryptophan-fracturing opened for partial sequencing by edman degradation. from leucocin halpha, the sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained; from leucocin hbeta the sequence of 28 amino acid residues was obtained. no sequence homology to other known bacteriocins could be demonstrated. it also appeared that the two peptides themselves shared little or no sequence homology. the presence of soy oil did not affect the activity of leucocin h in agar.

AB  == a genomic library of clostridium perfringens atcc 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the c. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. a positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb dna fragment insert was selected  and purified. lytic and lysogenic escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. the 3.8 kb dna fragment was amplified by pcr and found to hybridize with one band from c. perfringens dna digested with ecor1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. the fragment also hybridized with dna from other azoreductase-producing clostridium species, a eubacterium sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter amalonaticus and e. coli, but  not with dna from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. the data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of c. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in  others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.

AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

AB  == five spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants (one each of clostridium leptum, clostridium paraputrificum, two other clostridium spp. strains from the human intestinal microflora, and clostridium perfringens atcc 3626) were selected by growth on a nitrofurantoin-containing medium. all of the clostridium wild-type and mutant strains produced nitroreductase, as was shown by the conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to 4-aminobenzoic acid. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of the mutants during incubation with 50 microg of nitrofurantoin per ml showed the gradual disappearance of the nitrofurantoin peak. the nitrofurantoin peak also disappeared when cell-free supernatants instead of cultures of each of the resistant and wild-type bacteria were used, but it persisted if the cell-free supernatants had been inactivated by heat. at least two of the mutants converted nitrofurantoin to metabolites without antibacterial activity, as was shown by a bioassay with a nitrofurantoin-susceptible bacillus sp. strain. nitrofurantoin at a high concentration (50 microg/ml) continued to exert some toxicity, even on the resistant strains, as was evident from the longer lag phases. this study indicates that clostridium strains can develop resistance to nitrofurantoin while retaining the ability to produce nitroreductase; the mutants metabolized nitrofurantoin to compounds without antibacterial activity.

AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == the helicobacter pylori urec gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  == the function of urec, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureab) of helicobacter pylori, was investigated. we present data showing that the urec gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. d. mengin-lecreulx and j. van heijenoort (j. biol. chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that urec is similar (43% identity) to the glmm protein of escherichia coli. those authors showed that glmm is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into udp-n-acetylglucosamine. the latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. the present paper reports that, like its e. coli homolog glmm, the h. pylori urec gene is essential for cell growth. it was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmm mutant of e. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the urec gene. we showed that complete complementation of the  glmm mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing urec. the peptidoglycan  content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the urec gene  product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. homologs of the urec and glmm proteins were identified in haemophilus influenzae, mycobacterium leprae, clostridium perfringens, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, and methanococcus jannaschii. significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. we propose renaming the h. pylori urec gene the glmm gene.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == culture of intraluminal thrombus during abdominal aortic aneurysm resection: significant contamination is rare.
AB  == the significance of positive bacterial cultures from intraluminal thrombus in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains controversial. over the last 4 years, thrombus was cultured during aneurysm repair in 116 patients. all patients received cephalosporin antibiotic before and for 48 h after operation. although none of the aneurysms appeared to be clinically infected, six patients (5.2%) had positive cultures. four groups were identified  based on the bacteria cultured: group i, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light  growth (three patients); group ii, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth and 'streptococcus viridans' (one patient); group iii, bacillus sp., heavy growth (gram-negative stain) (one patient); group iv, clostridium perfringens, occasional growth (one patient). one of the six patients died during resection; the other five are alive without graft infection at 5-24 (mean 12) months after operation. the absence of graft infection suggests that positive cultures were not clinically significant or were adequately covered by the antibiotic prophylaxis. the incidence of positive cultures was lower than previously reported. routine culture of aneurysm thrombus in the absence of clinical infection is probably not cost-effective.

AB  == to study increase of the salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. inhibition of s typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (d-mannose, d-galactose, l-fucose, alpha-methyl-d-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. only d-mannose had inhibitory effects. whereas, d-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of s typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose inhibited adherence of s typhimurium. d-mannose significantly (p < 0.05) increased adherence of bacteroides sp. in infected and uninfected chickens, d-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of clostridium perfringens and bifidobacterium thermophilum. under microscopic observation, only concanavalin a and lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. in e tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. these results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the  intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.

TI  == apparition of clostridium sp. and bacteroides in the intestine of the newborn delivered by cesarian section.
AB  == anaerobic flora plays a key role in preventing intestinal colonization with potential pathogens. nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the colonization resistance provided by the anaerobic microflora are to be clarified. numerous factors seem to intervene in the regulation of the intestinal flora. the purpose  of the present study was to correlate the presence or relative absence of clostridium sp. and bacteroides with the colonization by c. perfringens, which is involved in lethal infections in an immunologically compromised host. the intestinal bacterial colonization of 20 newborns delivered by cesarian section was assessed sequentially over the first 14 days of life. c. perifringens is a strongly reducing microorganism and undoubtedly causes a decrease in the oxidoreduction potential of the newborn feces favouring the subsequent colonization by other putrefactive bacteria. c. perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of putrefractive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp.

TI  == raw beef, pork and chicken in japan contaminated with salmonella sp., campylobacter sp., yersinia enterocolitica, and clostridium perfringens--a comparative study.
AB  == one hundred and twenty samples each of raw ground beef, pork and chicken from ten local grocery stores in shimane prefecture, japan, were examined for the presence of salmonella sp. (sal), campylobacter jejuni (cj), campylobacter coli (cc), yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and clostridium perfringens (cp) from april 1984 to march 1985. a total of 205 isolates of sal (112 strains), cj (64 strains), cc (one strain), ye (7 strains) and cp (21 strains) were recovered from 17 beef (14.2%), 31 pork (25.8%) and 94 chicken (78.3%) of 120 samples each. sal biogroup 1 was found in 8.3% of beef, 13.3% of pork and 35.0% of chicken, sal biogroup 2 in 0.8% of beef, 4.2% of pork and 14.2% of chicken, cj in 1.7% of beef and pork and 50.0% of chicken, cc in 0.8% of pork, ye serotype 03 was found in 5.0% of pork, and cp in 1.7% of beef and pork and 10.8% of chicken. these enteropathogens were recovered concomitantly from two pork and 31 chicken samples, especially sal and cj. sal was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/100 g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(3)/100 g of chicken, cj was counted at less than or equal to 10(1)/g of beef and pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of chicken, ye serotype 03 was counted at less than or equal to 10(3)/g of pork, cp  was counted at less than or equal to 10(2)/g of pork and at less than or equal to 10(2)g of chicken, and cc from pork and cp from beef were recovered by using enrichment culture. this investigation showed that a second-contamination of sal  and cj from chicken to beef and pork frequently occurred during the warm months of the year. it was suggested that chicken may become a source of infection with  plural organisms of enteric pathogens, especially sal and cj, at the same time all the year round, and that pork may be an important source of infection with ye during the cold months.

TI  == antagonistic effect exerted by three strictly anaerobic strains against various strains of clostridium perfringens in gnotobiotic rodent intestines.
AB  == our purpose was to study bacterial antagonism between a limited number of strictly anaerobic strains and clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic rodents. gnotobiotic mice harboring a bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a fusobacterium necrogenes, and a clostridium sp. strain were protected against pathogenic b, c, and d c. perfringens serotypes. a drastic antagonistic effect of this three-strain association was also observed against a nonpathogenic c. perfringens serotype a (cpa). it was less efficient in gnotobiotic rats than in mice and less efficient in gnotobiotic mice fed an autoclaved diet than in mice fed the same diet sterilized by irradiation. no diffusible inhibitory substances  against cpa were detected in feces of gnotobiotic mice harboring the three antagonistic strains, and no nutrient depletion was demonstrated in filtrates prepared from 10-fold diluted feces of these mice. in vitro mixed cultures of the three antagonistic strains failed to inhibit growth of cpa, whereas cpa did not multiply in a 10-fold diluted feces from gnotobiotic mice. a reverse correlation  between the initial number of antagonistic strains and the division number of cpa was determined using serially diluted fecal suspensions. thus, large numbers of viable cells of both antagonistic strains were required to inhibit the target strain in fecal suspensions as was also found in gnotobiotic mice intestines. however, no diffusible inhibitory substance was detectable nor could depletion of growth factors be identified as causing antagonism. whatever factors that may be  responsible for antagonism were found to be influenced by the host and its diet.

AB  == the "in vitro" susceptibility to roxithromycin and three other macrolides of 236  anaerobes isolated from clinical samples in 1984/1985 was determined by an agar-dilution method on wilkins chalgren medium. 90% of gram positive cocci were  susceptible to both roxithromycin and josamycin (mic less than 1 mg/l, whereas 1  mg/l erythromycin and 2 mg/l spiramycin were able to inhibit respectively 46 and  86% of the same tested strains. no resistance to the four macrolides was observed among eubacterium, propionibacterium and bifidobacterium. two c. perfringens strains and one c. difficile strain were resistant to all four macrolides, while  97% of clostridium sp. strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l erythromycin, josamycin or roxithromycin. against gram positive anaerobes, roxithromycin was equal or superior to erythromycin and spiramycin. at a concentration of 4 mg/l, roxithromycin inhibited 82% of b. fragilis strains. roxithromycin and josamycin were more active against gram negative bacilli that erythromycin and spiramycin.  macrolides had no effect on fusobacterium strains. in this study, 4 mg/l roxithromycin inhibited 217 of the 236 anaerobic strains investigated (92%).

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.

TI  == competitive effects of intestinal microflora on vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.

TI  == sporulation and enterotoxin production by mutants of clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the ability of clostridium perfringens type a to produce an enterotoxin active in human food poisoning has been shown to be directly related to the ability of the  organism to sporulate. enterotoxin was produced only in a sporulation medium and  not in a growth medium in which sporulation was repressed. mutants with an altered ability to sporulate were isolated from an sp(+) ent(+) strain either as  spontaneous mutants or after mutagenesis with acridine orange or nitrosoguanidine. all sp(0) (-) mutants were ent(-). except for one isolate, these mutants were not disturbed in other toxic functions characteristic of the wild type and unrelated to sporulation. a total of four of seven osp(0) mutants retained the ability to produce detectable levels of enterotoxin. none of the ent(-) mutants produced gene products serologically homologous to enterotoxin. a  total of three sp(-) mutants, blocked at intermediate stages of sporulation, produced enterotoxin. of these mutants, one was blocked at stage iii, one probably at late stage iv, and one probably at stage v. a total of three sp(+) revertants isolated from an sp(-) ent(-) mutant regained not only the ability to  sporulate but also the ability to produce enterotoxin. the enterotoxin appears to be a sporulation-specific gene product; however, the function of the enterotoxin  in sporulation is unknown.

TI  == numerical data concerning the sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.
AB  == upon comparison of results obtained from growing eight different species of anaerobic bacteria in deep agar under two and three atm of pure oxygen with results of growing them in air under atomospheric pressure, it appears possible that the old terms of "microaerophobic," "very strict anaerobe," and "microaerophilic" can be replaced by precise values corresponding to the size of  the inhibition zone produced by oxygen under various pressures when the bacteria  are grown in a solid medium. the simultaneous effect of the dilution of the inoculum and the pressure of oxygen used was determined with the help of an electronic computer according to the standard multiple regression method. two indices have been worked out which express the sensitivity of the species at different oxygen pressures when varying numbers of anaerobic bacteria are used: x sp, which is the size in millimeters of the inhibition zone when 1:10 dilutions of the culture are grown under pure oxygen at atmospheric pressure (lp=0), and b  sp, which is the result of multiplying by 1.43 the difference in size of inhibition zone when 1:10 dilutions of the culture are grown under atmospheric air (lp = -0.7) and under pure oxygen at 1 atm absolute.
