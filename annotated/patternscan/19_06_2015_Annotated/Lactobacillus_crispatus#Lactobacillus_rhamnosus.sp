TI  == rapid species-level identification of vaginal and oral lactobacilli using maldi-tof ms analysis and 16s rdna sequencing.
AB  == background: lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host. specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection. the presence of lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries. despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods. this study evaluated rapid maldi-tof  ms analysis of vaginal and oral lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16s rdna  analysis. results: both methods were used to analyze 77 vaginal and 21 oral lactobacillus isolates. the concordance of both methods was at 96% with five samples discordantly identified. fifteen different lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily l. iners, l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. in the oral samples 11 different species were identified, mostly l. salivarius, l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei. overall, the species found belonged to six different phylogenetic groups. for several samples, maldi-tof ms  analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification. however, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16s rdna analysis result. conclusion: maldi-tof ms analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level. even though some results were ambiguous while 16s rdna sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases. thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant  lactobacillus species.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with  commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  == background: vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. objectives: the current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy  and bacterial vaginosis (bv) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects  with commercial vaginal probiotics. patients and methods: one hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and bv infected women. lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood bhi and mrs medias and genetically defined by 16s rrna sequencing. differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and bv infected were carried out by ison and hey grading protocol. identification of lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by multiplex pcr. the inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on hela (tumoral cervical cells) and hncf-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by mtt and trypan blue assays. results: l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy iranian women. l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the bv infected groups.  also the cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. conclusions: as l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in bv infected women and the  cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.

TI  == lactobacillus decelerates cervical epithelial cell cycle progression.
AB  == we investigated cell cycle progression in epithelial cervical me-180 cells during colonization of three different lactobacillus species utilizing live cell microscopy, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays, and flow cytometry. the colonization of these me-180 cells by l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri, originating from human gastric epithelia and saliva, respectively, was shown to reduce cell cycle progression and to cause host cells to accumulate in the g1 phase of the cell cycle. the g1 phase accumulation in l. rhamnosus-colonized cells was accompanied by the up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of p21. by contrast, the vaginal isolate l. crispatus did not affect cell cycle progression. furthermore, both the supernatants from the lactic acid-producing l. rhamnosus colonies and lactic acid added to cell culture media were able to reduce the proliferation of me-180 cells. in this study, we reveal the diversity of the lactobacillus species to affect host cell cycle progression and demonstrate that  l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exert anti-proliferative effects on human cervical carcinoma cells.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == inhibition of hiv and hsv infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == background and the purpose of the study: the cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. methods: the in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle hiv-1 replication and hsv-2 plaque reduction assays. the xtt proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. the in vivo anti-hsv-1 activity was evaluated in balb/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. results and major conclusion: dmem culture supernatant of l. gasseri and l. fermentum (ph 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of hiv replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. co-culture of l. gasseri  (1000 cfu/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of hiv replication. the supernatant of l. crispatus inhibited 50% of hsv replication at  4% and also co-culture of l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. crispatus revokes almost all of the hsv multiplication. culture supernatants of l. gasseri and l. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the hiv and hsv and inhibited  hsv infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. alive l. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting hsv-1 infection in vivo condition. current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with  neutralizing activity against hiv and hsv and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == bile stimulates cell surface hydrophobicity, congo red binding and biofilm formation of lactobacillus strains.
AB  == seventeen lactobacillus strains were tested for cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) using the salt aggregation test (sat) and congo red binding (crb) assay. crb was  dependent on ph and ionic strength and was protease-sensitive. in the presence of 100 mug ml(-1) cholesterol, the crb was significantly reduced. autoaggregating (aa) lactobacillus crispatus strains showed 50% more crb than the reference strain, the curli-producing escherichia coli mc4 100. crb of l. crispatus 12005,  l. paracasei f8, l. plantarum f44 and l. paracasei f19 were enhanced when grown in man rogosa sharpe (mrs) broth with 0.5% taurocholic acid (ta) or 5% porcine bile (pb) (p < 0.05). csh was also enhanced for the non-aa strains l. plantarum f44, l. paracasei f19 and l. rhamnosus gg when grown in mrs broth with 0.5% ta, 5% pb or 0.25% mucin, with enhanced biofilm formation in mrs broth with bile (p < 0.05). two aa strains, l. crispatus 12005 and l. paracasei f8, developed biofilm  independent of bile or mucin. in summary, under bile-stressed growth conditions,  early (24-h cultures) biofilm formation is associated with an increase in hydrophobic cell surface proteins and high crb. late mature (72-h culture) biofilm contained more carbohydrates, as shown by crystal violet staining.

TI  == commensal bacteria modulate innate immune responses of vaginal epithelial cell multilayer cultures.
AB  == the human vaginal microbiome plays a critical but poorly defined role in reproductive health. vaginal microbiome alterations are associated with increased susceptibility to sexually-transmitted infections (sti) possibly due to related changes in innate defense responses from epithelial cells. study of the impact of commensal bacteria on the vaginal mucosal surface has been hindered by current vaginal epithelial cell (vec) culture systems that lack an appropriate interface  between the apical surface of stratified squamous epithelium and the air-filled vaginal lumen. therefore we developed a reproducible multilayer vec culture system with an apical (luminal) air-interface that supported colonization with selected commensal bacteria. multilayer vec developed tight-junctions and other hallmarks of the vaginal mucosa including predictable proinflammatory cytokine secretion following tlr stimulation. colonization of multilayers by common vaginal commensals including lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. rhamnosus led to intimate associations with the vec exclusively on the apical surface. vaginal commensals did not trigger cytokine secretion but staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal, was inflammatory. lactobacilli reduced cytokine secretion in an isolate-specific fashion following tlr stimulation. this tempering of inflammation offers a potential explanation for increased susceptibility to sti in the absence of common commensals and has implications for testing of potential sti preventatives.

TI  == glutamine synthetase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase are adhesive moonlighting  proteins of lactobacillus crispatus released by epithelial cathelicidin ll-37.
AB  == glutamine synthetase (gs) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (gpi) were identified as novel adhesive moonlighting proteins of lactobacillus crispatus st1. both proteins were bound onto the bacterial surface at acidic phs, whereas a suspension of the cells to ph 8 caused their release into the buffer, a pattern previously observed with surface-bound enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) of l. crispatus. the ph shift was associated with a rapid and transient increase in cell wall permeability, as measured by cell staining with propidium iodide. a gradual increase in the release of the four moonlighting proteins was also observed after the treatment of l. crispatus st1 cells with increasing concentrations of the antimicrobial cationic peptide ll-37, which kills bacteria by disturbing membrane integrity and was here observed to increase the cell wall permeability of l. crispatus st1. at ph 4, the fusion proteins his(6)-gs, his(6)-gpi, his(6)-enolase, and his(6)-gapdh showed localized binding  to cell division septa and poles of l. crispatus st1 cells, whereas no binding to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg was detected. strain st1 showed a ph-dependent adherence to the basement membrane preparation matrigel. purified his(6)-gs and his(6)-gpi proteins bound to type i collagen, and his(6)-gs also bound to laminin, and their level of binding was higher at ph 5.5 than at ph 6.5. his(6)-gs also expressed a plasminogen receptor function. the results show the strain-dependent surface association of moonlighting proteins in lactobacilli and that these proteins are released from the l. crispatus surface after cell trauma, under conditions of alkaline stress, or in the presence of the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 produced by human cells.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == anti-allergic effects of lactobacillus crispatus kt-11 strain on ovalbumin-sensitized balb/c mice.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the effects of oral ingestion of lactobacillus crispatus kt-11 strain (kt-11) on the immune response in an allergic rhinitis mouse model, ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized balb/c mice. sneezing activity in mice that were administered a kt-11-supplemented diet was significantly lower than that in mice administered a kt-11-free diet (control diet) at age 11 weeks. we found that serum ova-specific immunoglobulin e (ige) levels and total number of interleukin (il)-4(+) cd4(+) spleen cells in mice that were administered a kt-11-supplemented diet were significantly lower than in mice administered a control diet. the ratio of spleen interferon-gamma(+) cd4(+) /il-4(+) cd4(+) cells was higher in the mice administered the kt-11-supplemented diet compared to that in mice administered the control or l. rhamnosus gg-supplemented diet. in contrast, the number of cd11b(+) cd80(+) and fcepsilonrialpha(+) cd117(+) cells was significantly lower in mice administered the kt-11-supplemented diet. these results suggested that kt-11 reduced ova-induced allergic symptoms in balb/c mice via the adjustment of the t helper type 1/t helper type 2 balance, and a decrease in the number of antigen-presenting cells and high affinity ige receptor-positive mast cells.

TI  == adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human specific pathogenic bacterium that colonises the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhoea. in this study we  analysed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. we show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between lactobacillus species. lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence while lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached  to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. hence, gonococci bind to colonised lactobacilli  and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting  in reduced bacterial colonisation. also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of  removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus vaginal microbiota of women attending a reproductive health care service in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine whether lactobacillus species found in african women differ substantially to those of white decent, described in previous studies. the vaginal microbiota play an important role in female health, and when the naturally dominant lactobacilli are displaced resulting in bacterial vaginosis (bv), the host is more at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including hiv. methods: vaginal samples were collected from 241 healthy, premenopausal nigerian women, which were then gram-stained for nugent scoring. microbial dna was extracted, amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and lactobacillus primers, and processed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). lactobacillus species were identified by dna sequencing and blast algorithm. results: of the samples, 207 (85.8%) had pcr products for lactobacilli, whereas 34 (14.2%) showed absence of lactobacilli, which correlated to the bv nugent scores. on sequencing of amplicons, 149 subjects (72%) had sequence homologies to lactobacilli. most women (64%) were colonized by l. iners as the predominant strain, similar to previous findings in canadian and swedish women. l. gasseri was found in 7.3% samples, followed by l. plantarum, l. suntoryeus, l. crispatus, l. rhamnosus, and other species. conclusion: the findings indicate that even with geographic, racial, and other differences, the predominant vaginal lactobacillus species is similar to species in women from northern countries.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == quality control lactobacillus strains for use with the api 50ch and api zym systems at 37 degrees c.
AB  == the api 50ch and api zym systems fulfil an important role in the polyphasic taxonomic identification of lactobacilli. when the api 50ch fermentation profile  of the quality control lactobacillus casei var. alactosus (lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) strain ncfb 206 was determined at 37 degrees c, it was found to differ from that determined at 30 degrees c by biomereiux sa (montalieu vercieu, france) and the national collection of food bacteria (aberdeen, scotland). in addition, the api 50ch fermentation and api zym profiles of lb. casei strain atcc 334t determined at 37 degrees c differed from those determined at 30 degrees c by lee  and simard (1984). strains ncfb 206 and atcc 334t were thus assumed to exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile, a phenomenon recently described by nigatu et al. (2000). in contrast, lb. rhamnosus strain atcc 243t did not exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile. moreover, the fermentation profile obtained at 37 degrees c differed in only one  respect (positive beta-gentiobiose utilisation) from that published by collins et al. (1989). in addition, lactobacillus strain gg produced a stable and reproducible api zym profile at 37 degrees c, although some variation in the level of enzyme activity was evident. thus, strain ncfb 206 was replaced by strain atcc 243t as the quality control strain of choice for use with the api 50ch fermentation system, and lactobacillus strain gg adopted for use as a quality control strain with the api zym system for strain identification of lactobacilli at 37 degrees c. the api 50ch and api zym profiles of the commercially important lactobacillus strains ncfb 1748, gg, kld, f19, and aca-dc  212.3 were determined at 37 degrees c after anaerobic growth in mrs broth. the fermentation and enzyme profiles of strain ncfb 1748 were almost identical to those of lb. crispatus atcc 33820t, those of strain gg were found to be more similar to those of lb. rhamnosus strain 243t than lb. zeae strain atcc 15820t, those of strain kld were most similar to those of lb. fermentum dsm 20052t, while those of strains f19 and aca-dc 212.3 were similar to those of lb. casei strain atcc 334t.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == identification of lactobacillus species of human origin by a commercial kit, api50chl.
AB  == the efficacy of a biochemical kit, api50chl kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results  of dna-dna hybridization assay. the results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. especially all strains of some species, such as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. however, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. this suggests that the exact identification of lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by api50chl kit is  difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.

TI  == isolation and identification of lactobacilli from novel-type probiotic and mild yoghurts and their stability during refrigerated storage.
AB  == a total of 26 lactobacillus strains were isolated from various mild yoghurts and  novel-type probiotic dairy products and from a starter culture preparation and were identified by using dna-dna hybridization technique. the species present in  those products were found to be lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. dna homology analysis revealed that some strains had been misclassified by their investigators. three strains designated as l. acidophilus (l. acidophilus la-1, l. acidophilus atcc 43121 and the lactobacillus strain from biogarde culture) were found to belong to l. johnsonii and l. acidophilus l1 to be l. crispatus. strains designated as l. casei were found to be members of three separate species: l. casei, l. paracasei  and l. rhamnosus. viable numbers of lactobacilli in mild and probiotic yoghurts varied greatly including some products with very low lactobacillus counts. the majority of the probiotic yoghurts, however, contained viable counts above 10(5)  per g even at the end of the best before use period.

TI  == lactobacillus species identification, h2o2 production, and antibiotic resistance  and correlation with human clinical status.
AB  == lactobacilli recovered from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory tract, and gut of 20 hospitalized immunocompromised septic patients were analyzed. biochemical carbohydrate fermentation and total soluble cell protein profiles were used to identify the species. hydrogen peroxide production was measured. susceptibility to 19 antibiotics was tested by a diffusion method, and the mics of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, and levofloxacin were determined. a small number of species produced h2o2, and antibiotic susceptibilities were species related. eighteen (90%) of the isolates  were l. rhamnosus, one was l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, and one was l. crispatus. l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, and the type strains were neither h2o2 producers nor vancomycin susceptible (mics, >/=256 microgram/ml). l. crispatus, as well as most of the type strains of lactobacilli  which belong to the l. acidophilus group, was an h2o2 producer and vancomycin susceptible (mics, <4 microgram/ml).

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
