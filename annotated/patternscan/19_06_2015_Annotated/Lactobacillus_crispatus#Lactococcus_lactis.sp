TI  == heterologous expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in lactococcus lactis via lcsb-mediated surface displaying system for oral vaccine development.
AB  == background/purpose: carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) is an attractive target for immunotherapy because it is expressed minimally in normal tissue, but is overexpressed in a wide variety of malignant epithelial tissues. lactic acid bacteria (labs), widely used in food processes, are attractive candidates for oral vaccination. thus, we examined whether labs could be used as a live vaccine  vector to deliver cea antigen. methods: cea was cloned into an escherichia coli/lactococcus lactis shuttle vector psec:leiss under the control of a nisin promoter. for displaying the cea on the cell surface of the l. lactis strain, the anchor motif lcsb from the s-layer protein of lactobacillus crispatus was fused with cea. intracellular and cell surface expression of the cea-lcsb fusion was confirmed by western blot analysis. results: significantly higher levels of cea-specific secretory immunoglobulin a in the sera of mice were observed upon oral administration of strain cultures containing the cea-lcsb fused protein. in  addition, the cea-lcsb antigen group showed a higher spleen index compared to the cea antigen alone or negative control, demonstrating that surface-displayed cea antigen could induce a higher immune response. conclusion: these results provided the first evidence for displaying cea antigen on the cell surfaces of labs as oral vaccines against cancer or infectious diseases.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
AB  == growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased  for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional  packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.

TI  == heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
AB  == background: previous studies have revealed that the c-terminal region of the s-layer protein from lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the c-terminal region of s-layer protein slpb of lactobacillus crispatus k2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. results: multiple sequence alignment revealed that the c-terminal region (lcsb) of lb. crispatus k2-4-3 slpb had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains sa and cbsa of lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. crispatus. to evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) or beta-galactosidase (gal) was fused to the n-terminus of the lcsb region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in escherichia coli, respectively. after mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused gfp-lcsb and gal-lcsb were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. in addition, the binding capacity could be improved by sds pretreatment. moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. furthermore,  when the fused dna fragment of gfp:lcsb was inserted into the lactococcus lactis  expression vector psec:leiss:nuc, the gfp could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisa promoter. western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay,  immunofluorescence microscopy and sds sensitivity analysis confirmed that the gfp was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of l. lactis with the aid of the lcsb anchor. conclusion: the lcsb region can be used as a functional scaffold to  target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in  vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus,  known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
