TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of fk-037, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk-037, a novel parenteral oxime-type cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefepime, cefpirome, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin  against a total of 668 recent clinical isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) colony forming units). fk-037 inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas species, and haemophilus influenzae at < or = 1 microgram/ml. fk-037 was less active against enterobacter species, acinetobacter  species, and pseudomonas species, requiring 16 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and was inactive against xanthomonas maltophilia. fk-037 inhibited 90%  of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at < or = 1 microgram/ml and 90% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus at < or = 8 micrograms/ml.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, b0-1165.
AB  == b0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. it inhibited the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and salmonella and shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the mics for individual isolates. enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime had mics that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. b0-1165 had activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. pseudomonas maltophilia and other pseudomonas species were resistant or had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, as did acinetobacter species. b0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as clostridium and bacteroides species. b0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally richmond-sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. it inhibited the enterobacter cloacae p99 and inducible pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. b0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing e. cloacae and c. freundii to b0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. overall, b0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of  other monobactams currently available or under investigation.

TI  == [in vitro bacteriostatic activity of cefmenoxime (sce 1365), cefotaxime and moxalactam].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing enterobacteriaceae. cefmenoxime was the most active against serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, salmonella, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica with a mean mic at least twice lower. several strains of the species hafnia alvei, providencia stuartii and proteus vulgaris were more resistant. against haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with  a mean mic between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. against staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean mic of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean mic of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
