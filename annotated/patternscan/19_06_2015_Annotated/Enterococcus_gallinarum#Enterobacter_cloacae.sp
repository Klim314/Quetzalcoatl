TI  == analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  == the diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. the dgge profiles targeted the bacterial 16s rdna and revealed the presence of citrobacter farmeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter  hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pantoea agglomerans, salmonella enterica, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus sciuri and weissella confusa. the bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. the bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; brachybacterium rhamnosum, e.  hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, kurthia gibsonii, pantoea dispersa, staphylococcus gallinarum, staphylococcus kloosii and s. sciuri were identified. koji collected  during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and e. hormaechei, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and enterobacter pulveris were identified.  in brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 bacillus species, but 4 staphylococcus species and delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. this study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and  provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.
