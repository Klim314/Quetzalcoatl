TI  - Structural and physiochemical characterization of rhamnolipids produced by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter asburiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in single strain and mixed cultures.
AB  - Rhamnolipids are naturally occurring biosurfactants with a wide range of potential commercial applications. As naturally derived products they present an ecological alternative to synthetic surfactants. The majority of described rhamnolipid productions are single strain Pseudomonas spp. cultivations. Here we report rhamnolipids producing bacteria Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter asburiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were cultivated separately and as mixed populations. The ratio and composition of rhamnolipid congeners was determined by tandem mass spectrometry with negative electrospray ionization. Mono-rhamnolipid and di-rhamnolipid homologues containing one or two saturated or monounsaturated 3-hydroxy fatty acids were found in all strains. Physiochemical characterization of rhamnolipids was evaluated by the critical micelle concentration determination, the emulsification test, oil displacement test and phenanthrene solubilization. Critical micelle concentrations of rhamnolipids produced by both single strain and mixed cultures were found to be very low (10-63 mg/l) and to correspond with saturated/unsaturated fatty acid content of rhamnolipid homologues. The rhamnolipids produced by all strains effectively emulsified crude petroleum in comparison with synthetic surfactants Tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Good performance of phenanthrene solubilization was exhibited by rhamnolipids from E. asburiae. The single strain and co-cultures cultivations were proposed as a possible way to produce rhamnolipid mixtures with a specific composition and different physiochemical properties, which could be exploited in bioremediation of various hydrophobic contaminants.
TI  - Quorum quenching activity in cell-free lysate of endophytic bacteria isolated from Pterocarpus santalinus Linn., and its effect on quorum sensing regulated biofilm in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - Quorum sensing mechanism allows the microorganisms to resist the antibiotic treatment by forming biofilms. Quorum quenching is one of the mechanisms to control the development of drug resistance in microbes. Endophyte bacteria are beneficial to plant growth as they support the immune system against the pathogen attack. The endophytic bacteria present in Pterocarpus santalinus were screened for the presence of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) degrading bacteria using biosensor strains and further confirmed by quantifying the violacein production. Cell-free lysate of endophytic bacteria, Bacillus firmus PT18 and Enterobacter asburiae PT39 exhibited potent AHL degrading ability by inhibiting about 80% violacein production in biosensor strain. Furthermore, when the cell-free lysate was applied to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and PAO1-JP2 biofilm it resulted in significant (p<0.01) inhibition of biofilm formation. The biofilm inhibition was confirmed by visualization of biofilm slides under fluorescence microscopy, which showed decrease in total biomass formation in treated slides. Isolation and amplification of the gene (aiiA) indicated that the presence of AHL lactonase in cell-free lysate and sequence alignment indicated that AiiA contains a "HXHXDH" zinc-binding motif that is being conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. Therefore, the study shows the potential of AHLs degradation by AHL lactonase present in cell-free lysate of isolated endophytic bacteria and inhibition of quorum sensing regulated biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1.
TI  - Characterization of rhamnolipids produced by non-pathogenic Acinetobacter and Enterobacter bacteria.
AB  - Rhamnolipid production by two non-pathogenic bacterial strains Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Enterobacter asburiae, and established rhamnolipid producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Rhamnolipids were separated from supernatant and further purified by thin-layer chromatography. Mass spectrometry with negative electrospray ionization revealed rhamnolipid homologues varying in chain length and unsaturation. Tandem mass spectrometry identified mono-rhamnolipid and di-rhamnolipid homologues containing one or two 3-hydroxy fatty acids. Several media differing in carbon (sunflower oil, glycerol and sodium citrate), nitrogen (ammonium ions, nitrate) and phosphorus (total content) source, respectively, were tested to obtain enhanced rhamnolipid production. The best production (0.56g/l) was obtained when nitrate was used as a nitrogen source. Both strains produced rhamnolipids that exhibited excellent emulsification activity with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons and several plant oils. Unlike P. aeruginosa the two strains, i.e. Acinetobacter and Enterobacter, are not pathogenic to humans.
TI  - Comparison of microbial diversity of edible flowers and basil grown with organic  versus conventional methods.
AB  - The consumption and use of edible flowers as food is growing; however, no study has been conducted to evaluate their role in the cause of food-borne illness or in food safety. Recent food-borne outbreaks traced to fresh herbs have raised concern about their processing and handling. Basil, one of the most commonly used fresh herbs, has been identified as a source of food-borne illness. Baseline assessments of microflora were performed, and the microbial diversity between growing methods (organic vs. conventional) was compared. DNA sequencing was used to identify the microbial flora present on fresh edible flower and basil samples. The most predominant species identified were Enterobacter hormaechei (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10%), Enterobacter ludwigii (10%), Enterobacter asburiae (6%), and Enterobacter cowanii (6%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), Salmonella enterica (6%), and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (2%) were also isolated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most species of isolated bacteria belonged to the phyla Gammaproteobacteria (81.2%) and Firmicutes (18.8%). Statistical analysis, diversity index for species richness, and lineage-per-time plots showed that for basil, organically grown samples had a higher microbial diversity than conventionally grown samples. Edible flowers and basil are often grown using organic methods and are commonly consumed raw without any washing or cooking, to preserve aesthetic value, but these practices may pose a potential risk for food-borne illness. The baseline assessment, together with phylogenetic and statistical analyses, indicated possible microbial contamination in edible flowers and basil. The use of statistical estimation of molecular diversity based on the 16S rRNA sequences and lineage-per-time plots with phylogenetic analysis well served as a means for comparing microbial diversity in food samples between the growing methods (organic vs. conventional).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of rhamnolipid-producing bacterial strains from a  biodiesel facility.
AB  - Novel strains of rhamnolipid-producing bacteria were isolated from soils at a biodiesel facility on the basis of their ability to grow on glycerol as a sole carbon source. Strains were identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Pantoea stewartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The strains of the former five species were found to produce rhamnolipids in quantities the same as, or similar to, coisolated strains of P. aeruginosa. Measurements of surface tension revealed that that emulsifying properties of these strains were similar to levels displayed by rhamnolipids produced by P. aeruginosa. Results of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS analyses revealed that the predominant compounds made by all strains were C10-C10 mono- and dirhamnolipids. Notably, E. hormaechei and one strain of A. calcoaceticus produced rhamnolipids in amounts similar to the pseudomonads. As all strains examined were from the same taxonomic class of Proteobacteria, further examination of this group may reveal many additional species not previously known to produce rhamnolipids in addition to novel strains of species currently known to produce rhamnolipids.
