TI  == molecular methods for diagnosis of odontogenic infections.
AB  == purpose: historically, the identification of microorganisms has been limited to species that could be cultured in the microbiology laboratory. the purpose of the present study was to apply molecular techniques to identify microorganisms in orofacial odontogenic infections (ois). materials and methods: specimens were obtained from subjects with clinical evidence of oi. to identify the microorganisms involved, 16s rrna sequencing methods were used on clinical specimens. the name and number of the clones of each species identified and the combinations of species present were recorded for each subject. descriptive statistics were computed for the study variables. results: specimens of pus or wound fluid were obtained from 9 subjects. a mean of 7.4 +/- 3.7 (standard deviation) species per case were identified. the predominant species detected in  the present study that have previously been associated with ois were fusobacterium spp, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella oris. the predominant species detected in our study that have not been previously associated with ois were dialister pneumosintes and eubacterium brachy. unculturable phylotypes accounted for 24% of the species identified in our study. all species detected were obligate or facultative anaerobes. streptococci were not detected. conclusions: molecular methods have enabled us to detect previously cultivated and not-yet-cultivated species in ois; these methods could change our  understanding of the pathogenic flora of orofacial ois.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == multivariate analyses of fatty acid data from whole-cell methanolysates of prevotella, bacteroides and porphyromonas spp.
AB  == the genus bacteroides contains a number of biochemically and physiologically heterogeneous groups of organisms and needs taxonomic revision. in this study cellular fatty acids from a number of bacteroides spp. were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the chemical data were then subjected to principal components analysis. in b. fragilis, which is the type species of the genus bacteroides, c3-oh-iso17 was the predominant fatty acid (38.0%) and cante15 was present in higher amounts (32.7%)  than ciso15 (14.6%). b. fragilis thus differed from all the other species examined: prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, p. (b.) oralis, p. (b.) oris, p. (b.)  disiens, p. (b.) veroralis, p. (b.) heparinolytica and porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis. principal components analysis also enabled the closely related p. buccae, p. oralis and p. oris to be differentiated.

TI  == multivariate analyses of cellular fatty acids in bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp.
AB  == the genera bacteroides, wolinella, and campylobacter contain several similar species that require taxonomic revision. fatty acid profiles of whole bacterial cells have proven useful for taxonomy. in this study, cellular fatty acids from bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp. were identified and quantitated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the data were subjected to principal component analyses. bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides, was distinct from the other organisms. while bacteroides gracilis, wolinella succinogenes, wolinella curva, wolinella recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis were  close to each other, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella oris, prevotella disiens, prevotella veroralis, prevotella heparinolyticus, porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis, and bacteroides ureolyticus could be distinguished. b. fragilis was characterized by the presence of c3oh-i-1-, ca-15, and ci-15 and the absence of c12:0 and unsaturated fatty acids. for comparison, b. gracilis, b. ureolyticus, w. succinogenes, w. curva, w. recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis contained c12:0, c16:1, c18:1, and c3-oh-14 acids but lacked branched hydroxy and branched nonhydroxy acids. b.  gracilis and b. ureolyticus are not "true" bacteroides.
