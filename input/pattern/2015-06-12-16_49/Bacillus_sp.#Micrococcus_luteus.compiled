TI  - Functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the South China Sea.
AB  - Phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. In this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different marine sponge species in the South China Sea using five different culture media. Eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and grouped into 13 genera, including Actinoalloteichus, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Nocardiopsis, Prauserella, Rhodococcus, Saccharopolyspora, Salinispora, Serinicoccus, and Streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Based on the screening of phzE genes, ten strains, including five Streptomyces, two Nocardiopsis, one Salinispora, one Micrococcus, and one Serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. The level of phzE gene expression was highly expressed in Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and Serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. Finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on ESI-MS and NMR analysis. The compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus mycoides SJ14, Staphylococcus aureus SJ51, Escherichia coli SJ42, and Micrococcus luteus SJ47. This study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Bacterial constituents of indoor air in a high throughput building in the tropics.
AB  - Airborne bacteria are significant biotic constituents of bioaerosol. Bacteria at  high concentrations in the air can compromise indoor air quality (IAQ) and result in many diseases. In tropical environments like Malaysia that extensively utilize air-conditioning systems, this is particularly significant due to continuous recirculation of indoor air and the potential implications for human health. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of airborne bacteria on IAQ in Malaysia. This study was prompted by a need for reliable baseline data on airborne bacteria in the indoor environment of tropical equatorial Malaysia, that may be used as a reference for further investigations on the potential role played by airborne bacteria as an agent of disease in this region. It was further necessitated due to the threat of bioterrorism with the potentiality of release of exotic pathogenic microorganisms into indoor or outdoor air. Before scientists can detect the latter, a gauge of the common microorganisms in indoor (as well as outdoor) air needs to be ascertained, hence the expediency of this study. Bacterial counts from the broad-based and targeted study were generally in the order of 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per m(3) of air. The most prevalent airborne bacteria found in the broad-based study that encompassed all five levels of the building were Gram-positive cocci (67.73%), followed by Gram-positive rods (24.26%) and Gram-negative rods (7.10%). Gram-negative cocci were rarely detected (0.71%). Amongst the genera identified, Kytococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Leifsonia sp., Bacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. predominated in indoor air. The most dominant bacterial species were Kytococcus sedentarius, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus. The opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also discovered at a high percentage in the cafeteria. The bacteria isolated in this study have been increasingly documented to cause opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised patients, sometimes with fatal outcomes. Furthermore, some of them are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Hence, we propose that indoor reservoirs of these bacteria and their associated clinical and more subtle health effects, if any, be investigated further.
TI  - Inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of Red Palm Weevil (Insecta).
AB  - Insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. In this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. We investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. The antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. OX1, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus). In addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial wall. This study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. However, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.
TI  - Agelamadins A and B, dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from a marine sponge Agelas sp.
AB  - Two structurally unique dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, agelamadins A (1) and B (2), were isolated from a marine sponge Agelas sp. Agelamadins A (1) and B (2) have a structure consisting of an agelastatin-like tetracyclic moiety and an oroidin-like linear moiety in common. The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. The antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of agelamadins A (1) and B (2) were evaluated.
TI  - [Phylogenetic analysis of bacteria of extreme ecosystems].
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of aerobic chemoorganotrophic bacteria of the two extreme regions (Dead Sea and West Antarctic) was performed on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene. Thermotolerant and halotolerant spore-forming bacteria 7t1 and 7t3 of terrestrial ecosystems Dead Sea identified as Bacillus licheniformis and B. subtilis subsp. subtilis, respectively. Taking into account remote location of thermotolerant strain 6t1 from closely related strains in the cluster Staphylococcus, 6t1 strain can be regarded as Staphylococcus sp. In terrestrial ecosystems, Galindez Island (Antarctic) detected taxonomically diverse psychrotolerant bacteria. From ornithogenic soil were isolated Micrococcus luteus O-1 and Microbacterium trichothecenolyticum O-3. Strains 4r5, 5r5 and 40r5, isolated from grass and lichens, can be referred to the genus Frondihabitans. These strains are taxonomically and ecologically isolated and on the tree diagram form the joint cluster with three isolates Frondihabitans sp., isolated from the lichen Austrian Alps, and psychrotolerant associated with plants F. cladoniiphilus CafT13(T). Isolates from black lichen in the different stationary observation points on the south side of a vertical cliff identified as: Rhodococcus fascians 181n3, Sporosarcina aquimarina O-7, Staphylococcus sp. 0-10. From orange biofilm of fouling on top of the vertical cliff isolated Arthrobacter sp. 28r5g1, from the moss-- Serratia sp. 6r1g. According to the results, Frondihabitans strains most frequently encountered among chemoorganotrophic aerobic bacteria in the Antarctic phytocenoses.
TI  - Antiparasitic chaiyaphumines from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus sp. PB61.4.
AB  - A new class of four depsipentapeptides called chaiyaphumines A-D (1-4) was isolated from Xenorhabdus sp. PB61.4. Their structures were elucidated by detailed 1D and 2D NMR experiments and by a Marfey's analysis following flash hydrolysis of the peptide. Verification of the structure was achieved by three-dimensional modeling using NOE-derived distance constraints, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization. Chaiyaphumine A (1) showed good activity against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 of 0.61 muM), the causative agent of malaria, and was active against other protozoal tropical disease causing agents.
TI  - Campechic acids A and B: anti-invasive polyether polyketides from a soil-derived  Streptomyces.
AB  - Campechic acids A (1) and B (2), two new polyketides, were isolated from the culture extract of Streptomyces sp., and their structures were determined by NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis. Campechic acids are polyether-polyketides functionalized by two tetrahydrofuran rings, an enolized 1,3-diketone, and multiple methyl substitutions. Absolute configuration of nine stereogenic centers in 1, except for four chiral centers in the cyclic ether moieties, was determined by the 1H NMR anisotropy method in combination with chemical degradation. Campechic acids exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC50 values in the nanomolar to submicromolar range.
TI  - Harvestman phenols and benzoquinones: characterisation and biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - Benzoquinones are usually present in arthropod defence exudates. Here, we describe the chemical profiles of 12 harvestman species belonging to the neotropical family Gonyleptidae. Nine of the studied species produced benzoquinones, while three produced alkyl phenols. Two benzoquinones and one phenol exhibited biological activity against bacteria and fungi. We also studied the biosynthesis of 2-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone by feeding Magnispina neptunus individuals with (1)(3)C-labelled precursors; the benzoquinones were biosynthesised through a polyketide pathway using acetate and propionate building blocks.
TI  - Production of peptide antibiotics by Bacillus sp. GU 057 indigenously isolated from saline soil.
AB  - A total of 112 soil samples were taken from differents areas of district D.I.Khan and Kohat (KPK) Pakistan and screened for production of antibiotics against the Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. Widest zone of inhibition (18mm) was produced by microorganism isolated from saline soil. The strain was later identified as Bacillus GU057 by standard biochemical assays. Maximum activity (18mm inhibition zone) was observed against Staphylococcus aureus after 48 hours of incubation at pH 8 and 4% concentration of glucose. The antibiotic was identified by autobiography as bacitracin. The Bacillus strain GU057 was confirmed as good peptide antibiotic producer and can effectively be indulged as biocontrol agent.
TI  - cgMolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.
AB  - A 5.5 kDa antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgMolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgMolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [MECs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ([MECs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/mL), without hemolytic activity. However, cgMolluscidin did not show any significant activity against Candida albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cgMolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (E value = 0) with only the unknown ESTs sequenced by C. gigas EST project. Tissue distribution of the cgMolluscidin mRNA suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. The cgMolluscidin mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with Vibrio sp. This peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including Lysine-Lysine or Lysine-Arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. These results suggest that cgMolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - Nurses' uniforms: How many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  - This pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. To achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in Washington State at the beginning of their shift. Worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. Each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. The results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. After 48 h, MRSA positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. Additional bacteria identified include: Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus roseus. The significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - A newly isolated Streptomyces sp. CS392 producing three antimicrobial compounds.
AB  - With the aim of isolating new microbes capable of producing strong antimicrobial  substances, strain CS392 was screened from 700 soil isolates preserved in our laboratory. The strain was related to genus Streptomyces based on various characteristics. Three highly active antimicrobial compounds, C1, C2 and C3, produced by the strain were purified by solvent extraction followed by silica gel column chromatography. These compounds were highly active against various Gram-positive resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among three, C3 was the most active against MRSA and VRSA with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/ml while C2 and C3 had MIC values of 4 mug/ml for the strains. In case of Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633, C1 and C3 were more effective with MIC values of 0.5 mug/ml than C2 with MIC of 2 mug/ml. Those antibiotics were variably active (MIC of 4-32 mug/ml) against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341 and VRE.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of aerobic culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria from surfacewater and groundwater of Rautahat District, Nepal.
AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater is a serious Environmental Health Management issue of drinking water sources especially in Terai region of Nepal. Many studies have reported that due to natural abundance of arsenic in the environment, various bacteria have developed different resistance mechanisms for arsenic compound. In this study, the culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria indigenous to surfacewater as well as groundwater from Rautahat District of Nepal were randomly isolated by standard plate count method on the basis of viable growth on plate count agar amended with arsenate ranging from 0, 0.5, 10, 40, 80 to 160 milligram per liter (mg/l). With respect to the morphological and biochemical tests, nine morphologically distinct potent arsenate tolerant bacteria showed relatedness with Micrococcus varians, Micrococcus roseus, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas sp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus smithii 1 and Bacillus smithii 2. The isolates were capable of tolerating more than 1000 mg/l of arsenate and 749 mg/l of arsenite. Likewise, bioaccumulation capability was highest with M. roseus (85.61%) and the least with B. smithii (47.88%) indicating the potential of the organisms in arsenic resistance and most probably in bioremediation.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Identification of Streptomyces sp. KH29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The Actinomycete strain KH29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KH29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. By way of its noted 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences, KH29 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces cinnamonensis. The production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (PY) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees C. The antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including MS and NMR as a cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). Cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp), from the PY cultures of KH29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, cyclo(LTrp- L-Trp) had antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans, However, it was ineffective against Streptomyces murinus.
TI  - Abyssomicin I, a modified polycyclic polyketide from Streptomyces sp. CHI39.
AB  - Abyssomicin I (1), a new modified polycyclic polyketide, was isolated from the culture extract of a soil-derived Streptomyces sp. The structure of 1 was elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data. The stereochemistry of the new compound was assigned by NOE analysis, chemical derivatization, and application of the modified Mosher method. While 1 was inactive against bacteria and yeasts, the oxidized derivative 7 showed weak activities against gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 1 and 7 exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC(50) values of 11 and 0.21 muM, respectively.
TI  - Streptomyces caeruleatus sp. nov., with dark blue diffusible pigment.
AB  - An actinomycete, designated strain GIMN4.002(T), was isolated from a tomato rhizosphere soil sample in Guangzhou, China. The strain produces white aerial mycelium and dark blue diffusible pigment on Gause's synthetic agar, and microscopic observation revealed that it produces looped chains of spiny spores. Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the strain are typical of the genus Streptomyces. Melanin was produced and antibacterial activity was detected against Gram-positive micro-organisms, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GIMN4.002(T) had highest similarity (99.4 %) to Streptomyces lincolnensis B91; however, DNA-DNA relatedness between strain GIMN4.002(T) and S. lincolnensis NBRC 13054(T) was only 32.17 %. Further, the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain GIMN4.002(T) are distinct from S. lincolnensis and other species of the genus Streptomyces with which this strain has high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98-99 %). On the basis of the physiological and molecular properties observed, it is proposed that strain GIMN4.002(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces caeruleatus sp. nov. is proposed, with GIMN4.002(T) (=CCTCC M 208213(T) =NRRL B-24802(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Effect of plant age on endophytic bacterial diversity of balloon flower (Platycodon grandiflorum) root and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Balloon flower (Platycodon grandiflorum) is widely cultivated vegetable and used  as a remedy for asthma in East Asia. Experiments were conducted to isolate endophytic bacteria from 1-, 3-, and 6-year-old balloon flower roots and to analyze the enzymatic, antifungal, and anti-human pathogenic activities of the potential endophytic biocontrol agents obtained. Total 120 bacterial colonies were isolated from the interior of all balloon flower roots samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the population of 'low G + C gram-positive bacteria' (LGCGPB) gradually increased 60.0-80.0% from 1 to 6 years balloon flower sample. On the other hand, maximum hydrolytic enzyme activity showing endophytic bacteria was under LGCGPB, among the bacterial strains, Bacillus sp. (BF1-1 and BF3-8), Bacillus sp. (BF1-2 and BF3-5), and Bacillus sp. (BF1-3, BF3-6, and BF6-4) showed maximum enzyme activities. Besides, Bacillus licheniformis (BF3-5 and BF6-6) and Bacillus pumilus (BF6-1) showed maximum antifungal activity against Phytophthora capsici, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Pythium ultimum. Moreover, Bacillus licheniformis was found in 3 and 6 years balloon flower roots, but Bacillus pumilus was found only in 6 years sample. It is presumed that older balloon flower plants invite more potential antifungal endophytes for there protection from plant diseases. In addition, Bacillus sp. (BF1-2 and BF3-5) showed maximum anti-human pathogenic activity. So, plant age is presumed to influence diversity of balloon flower endophytic bacteria.
TI  - Discorhabdins from the Korean marine sponge Sceptrella sp.
AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Nagelamides Q and R, novel dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from sponges Agelas sp.
AB  - Two new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides Q (1) and R (2), have been isolated from Okinawan marine sponges of the genus Agelas (SS-1134 and SS-956, respectively), and the structures and stereochemistry were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamide Q (1) is a rare dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloid possessing a pyrrolidine ring, while nagelamide R (2) is the first bromopyrrole alkaloid having an oxazoline ring. Nagelamides Q (1) and R (2) showed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D-alanine, L-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15N and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  - We have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (R)-(-)-2-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. First, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. Second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. We applied the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of D- and L-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria; Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus staphylolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (Bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (Methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15N ( per thousand vs air) in Staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and L-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in Bacillus subtilis for D-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and L-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). These results suggest that enzymatic reaction pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15N-depleted D-alanine. This method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Twenty-five Campylobacter isolates were screened for production of antimicrobial  substances using a deferred antagonism assay. Sixteen isolates showed activity against either Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Candida albicans. The inhibitory activity was sensitive to treatment with pronase E, trypsin and pepsin, suggesting that the antimicrobial compound(s) are proteinaceous. Activity spectra of isolates included S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, a drug-resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and one isolate of C. albicans. Producing isolates showed cross-immunity and inhibitory activity was only observed on solid media. The findings of this study suggest that Campylobacter produces proteinaceous inhibitory substances.
TI  - Bacterial, fungal and yeast contamination in six brands of irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials.
AB  - This study assessed the level of contamination of six commercially available irreversible hydrocolloids (two containing chlorhexidine) and identified the contamination present in the materials. Petri dishes containing selective and enriched culture media were inoculated with alginate powder (0.06 g), in triplicate. After incubation (37 degrees C/7 days), the colony-forming units (CFU) were counted and Gram stained. Biochemical identification of the different morphotypes was also performed. The contamination levels for the materials were: Jeltrate--389 CFU/g; Jeltrate Plus--516 CFU/g; Jeltrate Chromatic--135 CFU/g; Hydrogum--1,455 CFU/g; Kromopan--840 CFU/g; and Greengel--59 CFU/g. Gram staining revealed the presence of Gram-positive bacillus and Gram-positive cocci. The bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus sp., Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, and Nocardia sp.; the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizopus sp., Neurospora sp.; and the yeast Candida sp. were isolated. The contamination detected in the impression materials points out the need for adopting measures to improve the microbiological quality of these materials. The use of contaminated materials in the oral cavity goes against the basic principles for controlling cross-contamination and may represent a risk for debilitated or immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in the common seawhip, Leptogorgia virgulata (Cnidaria: Gorgonaceae).
AB  - Antimicrobial activity was examined in the gorgonian Leptogorgia virgulata (common seawhip) from South Carolina waters. Extraction and assay protocols were developed to identify antimicrobial activity in crude extracts of L. virgulata. Detection was determined by liquid growth inhibition assays using Escherichia coli BL21, Vibrio harveyii, Micrococcus luteus, and a Bacillus sp. isolate. This represents the first report of antimicrobial activity in L. virgulata, a temperate/sub-tropical coral of the western Atlantic Ocean. Results from growth inhibition assays guided a fractionation scheme to identify active compounds. Reverse-phase HPLC, HPLC-mass spectrometry, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to isolate, purify, and characterize metabolites in antimicrobial fractions of L. virgulata. Corroborative HPLC-MS/NMR evidence validated the presence of homarine and a homarine analog, well-known emetic metabolites previously isolated from L. virgulata, in coral extracts. In subsequent assays, partially-purified L. virgulata fractions collected from HPLC-MS fractionation were shown to contain antimicrobial activity using M. luteus and V. harveyii. This study provides evidence that homarine is an active constituent of the innate immune system in L. virgulata. We speculate it may act synergistically with cofactors and/or congeners in this octocoral to mount a response to microbial invasion and disease.
TI  - Microbiological changes in naturally fermented cassava fish (Pseudotolithus sp.)  for lanhouin production.
AB  - Cassava fish (Pseudotolithus sp.) was naturally fermented on three different occasions at room temperature (28-30 degrees C) for 3 to 8 days and the microbial population and the occurrence of various bacterial species were monitored. In general, after a slight increase during the early stages of fermentation, the microbial population decreased as the fermentation progressed. A total of 224 isolates belonging to the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterim, Pseudomonas, Achromobacter and Alcaligenes were isolated from the fermenting fish samples and the predominant ones were identified at the species level. Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were the predominant genera and accounted for 48.7% and 27.3% of the total number of isolates respectively. Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus lentus and Staphylococcus xylosus and Micrococcus luteus were the representative strains isolated during the fermentation. Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Micrococcus spp. initiated the fermentation but Micrococcus spp. were few in numbers and died off after four (4) days of fermentation while Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. persisted up to the end of fermentation. Enterobacteriaceae were fewer in numbers at the start of fermentation (10(2) cfu/g) and their numbers decreased to less than 10 cfu/g after two days of fermentation. Bacillus spp. as well as Staphylococcus spp. isolated possessed moderate proteolytic and lipolytic activities. Micrococcus spp. showed weak proteolytic activity and no lipolytic activity.
TI  - Identification of diazotrophs in the culturable bacterial community associated with roots of Lasiurus sindicus, a perennial grass of Thar Desert, India.
AB  - Lasiurus sindicus is a highly nutritive, drought-tolerant, perennial grass that is endemic to the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, India. Analysis of 16S rRNA coding genes of the bacterial isolates enriched in nitrogen-free semisolid medium, from the surface-sterilized roots of L. sindicus, showed predominance of Gram-negative over Gram-positive bacteria. According to comparative sequence analysis of 16S rDNA sequence data, Gram-positive bacteria with low GC content (Staphylococcus warneri and Bacillus sp.) and high GC content (Micrococcus luteus, Microbacterium sp.) were identified. Gram-negative bacteria included Azospirillum sp., Rhizobium sp., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Inquilinus limosus (alpha-proteobacteria); Ralstonia sp., Variovorax paradoxus, and Bordetella petrii (beta-proteobacteria); and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Stenotrophomonas sp. (gamma-proteobacteria). The occurrence of nifH sequences in Azospirillum sp., Rhizobium sp., and P. pseudoalcaligenes showed the possibility of supplying biologically fixed nitrogen by the root-associated diazotrophs to the host plant.
TI  - The lantibiotic mersacidin is an autoinducing peptide.
AB  - The lantibiotic (lanthionine-containing antibiotic) mersacidin is an antimicrobial peptide consisting of 20 amino acids and is produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728. The structural gene (mrsA) and the genes for producer self-protection, modification enzymes, transport proteins, and regulator proteins are organized in a 12.3-kb biosynthetic gene cluster on the chromosome of the producer strain. Mersacidin is produced in stationary phase in a synthetic medium (K. Altena, A. Guder, C. Cramer, and G. Bierbaum, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66:2565-2571, 2000). To investigate the influence of the alternative sigma factor H on mersacidin biosynthesis, a SigH knockout was constructed. The knockout mutant was asporogenous, and a comparison to the wild-type strain indicated no significant differences concerning mersacidin production and immunity. Characterization of the mrsA promoter showed that the gene is transcribed by the housekeeping sigma factor A. The biosynthesis of some lantibiotic peptides like nisin or subtilin is regulated in a cell-density-dependent manner (M. Kleerebezem, Peptides 25:1405-1414, 2004). When mersacidin was added at a concentration of 2 mg/liter to an exponentially growing culture, an earlier production of antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698 in comparison to that of the control culture was observed, suggesting that mersacidin itself functions as an autoinducer. In real-time PCR experiments, the expression of mrsA was remarkably increased in the induced culture compared to the control. In conclusion, mersacidin is yet another lantibiotic peptide whose biosynthesis can be regulated by an autoinducing mechanism.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Selection and identification of bacteria isolated from waste crude oil with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons removal capacities.
AB  - Fifteen bacterial strains isolated from solid waste oil samples were selected due to their capacity of growing in the presence of hydrocarbons. The isolates were identified by PCR of the 16S rDNA gene using fD1 and rD1 primers. The majority of the strains belonged to genera Bacillus, Bacillus pumilus (eight strains) and Bacillus subtilis (two strains). Besides, three strains were identified as Micrococcus luteus, one as Alcaligenes faecalis and one strain as Enterobacter sp. Growth of the above-mentioned strains in mineral liquid media amended with naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene or pyrene as sole carbon source was studied and our results showed that these strains can tolerate and remove different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that may be toxic in the environment polluted with hydrocarbons. Finally, the capacity of certain strains to emulsify octane, xilene, toluene, mineral oil and crude oil, and its ability to remove hydrocarbons, look promising for its application in bioremediation technologies.
TI  - Characterization of microbial contamination in United States Air Force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  - Bacteria and fungi, isolated from United States Air Force (USAF) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (GC-FAME) profiling and 16S or 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated USAF bases were collected. At each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. Twelve genera, including four Bacillus species and two Staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. Bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. Of the organisms identified, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Sphinogmonas sp., Staphylococcus sp., and the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. The bacteria Pantoea ananatis, Arthrobacter sp., Alcaligenes sp., Kocuria rhizophilia, Leucobacter komagatae, Dietza sp., and the fungus Discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in USAF aviation fuel. Only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. Isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and identification techniques.
TI  - Investigations on bacteria as a potential biological control agent of summer chafer, Amphimallon solstitiale L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).
AB  - Studying the bacteria of hazardous insects allows the opportunity to find potentially better biological control agents. Therefore, in this study, bacteria from summer chafer (Amphimallon solstitiale L., Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) we isolated and identified the insecticidal effects of bacteria isolated from A. solstitiale and Melolontha melolontha L. (common cockchafer, Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and the mixtures of these bacterial isolates were investigated on A. solstitiale larvae. Crystals from Bacillus sp. isolated from M. melolontha were also purified, and tested against the second and third-stage larvae of A. solstitiale. The bacterial isolates of A. solstitiale were identified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus, based on their morphology, spore formation, nutritional features, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. The insecticidal effects of the bacterial isolates determined on the larvae of A. solstitiale were 90% with B. cereus isolated from A. solstitiale, and 75% with B. cereus, B. sphaericus and B. thuringiensis isolated from M. melolontha within ten days. The highest insecticidal effects of the mixed infections on the larvae of A. solstitiale were 100% both with B. cereus+B. sphaericus and with B. cereus+B. thuringiensis. In the crystal protein bioassays, the highest insecticidal effect was 65% with crystals of B. thuringiensis and B. sphaericus isolated from M. melolontha within seven days. Finally, our results showed that the mixed infections could be utilized as microbial control agents, as they have a 100% insecticidal effect on the larvae of A. solstitiale.
TI  - Surface microflora of four smear-ripened cheeses.
AB  - The microbial composition of smear-ripened cheeses is not very clear. A total of  194 bacterial isolates and 187 yeast isolates from the surfaces of four Irish farmhouse smear-ripened cheeses were identified at the midpoint of ripening using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), repetitive sequence-based PCR, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for identifying and typing the bacteria and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtDNA RFLP) analysis for identifying and typing the yeast. The yeast microflora was very uniform, and Debaryomyces hansenii was the dominant species in the four cheeses. Yarrowia lipolytica was also isolated in low numbers from one cheese. The bacteria were highly diverse, and 14 different species, Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter arilaitensis, Arthrobacter sp., Microbacterium gubbeenense, Agrococcus sp. nov., Brevibacterium linens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Halomonas venusta, Vibrio sp., and Bacillus sp., were identified on the four cheeses. Each cheese had a more or less unique microflora with four to nine species on its surface. However, two bacteria, C. casei and A. arilaitensis, were found on each cheese. Diversity at the strain level was also observed, based on the different PFGE patterns and mtDNA RFLP profiles of the dominant bacterial and yeast species. None of the ripening cultures deliberately inoculated onto the surface were reisolated from the cheeses. This study confirms the importance of the adventitious, resident microflora in the ripening of smear cheeses.
TI  - Identification of bacteria isolated from an oligotrophic lake with pesticide removal capacities.
AB  - We studied the growth and capacities for pesticides removal of bacterial strains  isolated from the Laguna Grande, an oligotrophic lake at the South of Spain (Archidona, Malaga). Strains were isolated from water samples amended with 10 and 50 microg/ml of nine pesticides: organochlorinated insecticides (aldrin and lindane), organophosphorous insecticides (dimetoate, methyl-parathion and methidation), s-triazine herbicides (simazine and atrazine), fungicide (captan) and diflubenzuron (1-(-4-chlorophenyl)-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl urea), a chitinase inhibitor. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Pseudomonas and Aeromonas and only 9% of the total of strains were Gram positive. From all the strains isolated, only 22 showed a wide growth range in all the pesticides tested and 4 of them were chosen for pesticide removal studies. The genetic identification of these strains showed their affiliation to Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus sp. and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum. These last two strains were those that showed the highest pesticide removal capacities and a high bacterial growth.
TI  - [Auxin production by bacteria associated with orchid roots].
AB  - Bacteria associated with the roots of greenhouse tropical orchids were shown to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and to excrete it into the culture liquid. The presence and activity of IAA were demonstrated colorimetrically, by thin-layer chromatography, and by biotests. The associated bacteria varied in their ability to excrete indole compounds (1-28 microg/ml nutrient broth). Addition of tryptophan to the growth medium enhanced phytohormone production. Upon addition of 200 microg/ml tryptophan, the bacteria isolated from Dendrobium moschatum roots (Sphingomonas sp. 18, Microbacterium sp. 23, Mycobacterium sp. 1, Bacillus sp. 3, and Rhizobium sp. 5) produced 50.2, 53.1, 92.9, 37.6, and 60.4 microg IAA/ml respectively, while the bacteria isolated from Acampe papillosa roots (Sphingomonas sp. 42, Rhodococcus sp. 37, Cellulomonas sp. 23, Pseudomonas sp. 24, and Micrococcus luteus) produced 69.4, 49.6, 53.9, 31.0, and 39.2 microg IAA/ml. Auxin production depended on cultivation conditions and on the growth phase of the bacterial cultures. Treatment of kidney bean cuttings with bacterial culture liquid promoted formation of a "root brush" with location height 7.4- to 13.4-fold greater than the one in the control samples. The ability of IAA-producing associated bacteria to act as stimulants of the host plant root development is discussed.
TI  - Nagelamides A-H, new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from marine sponge Agelas species.
AB  - Eight new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides A-H (1-8) and a monomeric one, 9,10-dihydrokeramadine (9), have been isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Agelas sp., and the structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamides A-H (1-8) exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Nagelamide G (7) inhibited protein phosphatase 2A activity.
TI  - 14C-[lignin]-lignocellulose biodegradation by bacteria isolated from polluted soil.
AB  - Four bacterial species [Branhamella catarrhalis (gram -ve), Brochothrix species (gram -ve), Micrococcus luteus (gram +ve) and Bacillus firmus (gram +ve)], isolated from the soil polluted with cane sugar factory effluents, were found capable of growing on solid media supplemented with indulin AT (a polymeric industrial lignin) as sole C source. All the four species could metabolize cinnamic acid (a non-hydroxylated phenylpropanoid) as sole carbon source with significant suppression on addition of readily metabolizable carbon source (glucose). However, Br. catarrhalis and Brochothrix sp. were capable of metabolizing ferulic acid, but could not do so on addition of glucose. Of the four species, Br. catarrhalis could evolve significant amount of 14CO2 from U-14C (lignin)-lignocellulose prepared from rice stalks (ca. 10% of the added radioactivity in 3 weeks), in addition to solubilization of another 11.7% radioactivity in culture filtrate. The other three species could not significantly evolve 14CO2, though a significant fraction of added 14C-lignin (6.1 to 11.2%) could be solubilized into culture filtrate, suggesting lack of ring-cleavage or other CO2 evolving mechanisms in these species.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Isolation and insecticidal effects of some bacteria from Euproctis chrysorrhoea L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae).
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial pathogens of Euproctis chrysorrhoea  and tested for their insecticidal activities. Based on colony color and morphology, four isolates were determined. According to morphological, physiological and biochemical characters of the isolates, they were identified as Enterobacter aerogenes, Lactobacillus sp., Bacillus thuringiensis and Micrococcus luteus. The insecticidal effects of these bacterial isolates on third-fourth instar larvae of Euproctis chrysorrhoea were investigated. The highest insecticidal effect determined on this pest is 68% with Bacillus thuringiensis. The effects of the other isolates are 45% with Enterobacter aerogenes, 15% Micrococcus luteus and 0% with Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Stresgenin B, an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein gene expression, produced by Streptomyces sp. AS-9.
AB  - Stresgenin B was isolated as an inhibitor of heat-induced heat shock protein (HSP) gene expression from a culture broth of Streptomyces sp. AS-9 by silica gel chromatography and HPLC. The molecular formula of the novel compound was determined as C11H13NO5 by high resolution FAB-MS analysis, and the structure was determined by UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY spectra. Stresgenin B inhibited heat-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the human hsp70B promoter in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at concentrations lower than the concentrations for inhibition of dexamethasone-induced luciferase reporter-gene expression directed by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-LTR promoter. The inhibition of heat-induced reporter gene expression was evident even when cells were exposed to stresgenin B only during heat stress treatment. Moreover, the compound inhibited heat-induced syntheses of hsp72/73, hsp90, and hsp110 and thereby suppressed the induction of thermotolerance. Stresgenin B showed moderate cytotoxic activities against several neoplastic cell lines and also showed antibacterial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus strains.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  - Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  - Mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in January, April, July, and October from 1984 to 1989. Unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the Jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. Of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. From the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forPseudomonas syringae, followed byXanthomonas campestris (6.7%),Erwinia herbicola (6%),Acetobacter aceti (4.7%),Gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),Pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),Bacillus megaterium (3.8%),Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),Lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),Curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),Micrococcus luteus (2.2%),Arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),Klebsiella planticola (1.2%),Streptococcus faecium (1.2%),Clavibacter sp. (0.98%),Micrococcus sp. (0.82%),Serratia marcescens (0.81%),Bacillus subtilis (0.57%),Cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),Erwinia sp. (0.37%),Zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),Bacillus sp. (0.29%),Alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),Erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andPseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). Bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. Communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. The communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
