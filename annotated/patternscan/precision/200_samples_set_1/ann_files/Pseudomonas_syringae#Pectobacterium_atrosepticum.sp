TI  == methylobacterium-induced endophyte community changes correspond with protection of plants against pathogen attack.
AB  == plant inoculation with endophytic bacteria that normally live inside the plant without harming the host is a highly promising approach for biological disease control. the mechanism of resistance induction by beneficial bacteria is poorly understood, because pathways are only partly known and systemic responses are typically not seen. the innate endophytic community structures change in response to external factors such as inoculation, and bacterial endophytes can exhibit direct or indirect antagonism towards pathogens. earlier we showed that resistance induction by an endophytic methylobacterium sp. in potato towards pectobacterium atrosepticum was dependent on the density of the inoculum, whereas the bacterium itself had no antagonistic activity. to elucidate the role of innate endophyte communities in plant responses, we studied community changes in  both in vitro and greenhouse experiments using various combinations of plants, endophyte inoculants, and pathogens. induction of resistance was studied in several potato (solanum tuberosum l.) cultivars by methylobacterium sp. imbg290 against the pathogens p. atrosepticum, phytophthora infestans and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000, and in pine (pinus sylvestris l.) by m. extorquens dsm13060 against gremmeniella abietina. the capacities of the inoculated endophytic methylobacterium spp. strains to induce resistance were dependent on the plant cultivar, pathogen, and on the density of methylobacterium spp. inoculum. composition of the endophyte community changed in response to inoculation in shoot tissues and correlated with resistance or susceptibility to  the disease. our results demonstrate that endophytic methylobacterium spp. strains have varying effects on plant disease resistance, which can be modulated  through the endophyte community of the host.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == regulation of type vi secretion gene clusters by sigma54 and cognate enhancer binding proteins.
AB  == type vi secretion systems (t6ss) are bacteriophage-derived macromolecular machines responsible for the release of at least two proteins in the milieu, which are thought to form an extracellular appendage. although several t6ss have  been shown to be involved in the virulence of animal and plant pathogens, clusters encoding these machines are found in the genomes of most species of gram-negative bacteria, including soil, marine, and environmental isolates. t6ss  have been associated with several phenotypes, ranging from virulence to biofilm formation or stress sensing. their various environmental niches and large diversity of functions are correlated with their broad variety of regulatory mechanisms. using a bioinformatic approach, we identified several clusters, including those of vibrio cholerae, aeromonas hydrophila, pectobacterium atrosepticum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and a marinomonas sp., which possess typical -24/-12 sequences, recognized by the alternate sigma factor sigma 54 (sigma(54) or sigma(n)). sigma(54), which directs the rna polymerase to these promoters, requires the action of a bacterial enhancer binding protein (bebp), which binds to cis-acting upstream activating sequences. putative bebps are encoded within the t6ss gene clusters possessing sigma(54) boxes. using in vitro binding experiments and in vivo reporter fusion assays, we showed that the expression of these clusters is dependent on both sigma(54) and bebps.

TI  == identification of an antibacterial compound, benzylideneacetone, from xenorhabdus nematophila against major plant-pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == an entomopathogenic bacterium, xenorhabdus nematophila, is known to have potent antibiotic activities to maintain monoxenic condition in its insect host for effective pathogenesis and ultimately for optimal development of its nematode symbiont, steinernema carpocapsae. in this study we assess its antibacterial activity against plant-pathogenic bacteria and identify its unknown antibiotics.  the bacterial culture broth had significant antibacterial activity that increased with development of the bacteria and reached its maximum at the stationary growth phase. the antibiotic activities were significant against five plant-pathogenic bacterial strains: agrobacterium vitis, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, and ralstonia solanacearum. the antibacterial factors were extracted with butanol and fractionated using column chromatography with the eluents of different hydrophobic intensities. two active antibacterial subfractions were purified, and the higher active fraction was further fractionated and identified as a single compound of benzylideneacetone (trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one). with heat stability, the synthetic compound showed equivalent antibiotic activity and spectrum to the purified compound. this study reports a new antibiotic compound synthesized by x. nematophila, which is a monoterpenoid compound and active against some gram-negative bacteria.
