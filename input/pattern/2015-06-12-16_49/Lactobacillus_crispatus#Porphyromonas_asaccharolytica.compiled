TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
