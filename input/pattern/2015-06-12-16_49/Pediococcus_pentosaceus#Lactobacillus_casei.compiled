TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria-Inhibited Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria are able to produce antimicrobial compounds to inhibit opportunisticwounding skin pathogen. The antimicrobial compounds produced are organic acids, putative bacteriocin, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl. Staphylococcus epidermidis is well-known as an opportunistic wounding skin pathogen in wound infections related to implanted medical devices. OBJECTIVE: To screen 87 strains of LAB and 3 strains of bifidobacteria for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis.Additionally, this study sought to determine and quantify types of antimicrobial compounds produced by LAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibitory activity of LAB and bifidobacteria on S. epidermidis was assessed with the spectrophotometric method using a 96-well microplate reader. Characterization of cell-free supernatant (CFS) was done using analytical methods. Lactobacillus fermentum (collected by the Bioprocess Department at the Universiti Sains Malaysia [BD]) 1912d, Lactobacillus casei BD 1415b, Lactobacillus fermentum BD 8313a, Pediococcus pentosaceus BD 1913b, and Weissella cibaria (collected by the Food Technology Department at the Universiti Sains Malaysia [FTDC]) 8643 with high percentage of inhibition (P < 0.05), ranging from 73.7% to 88.2%, as compared to the control, were selected for subsequent analyses. Upon neutralization, the antimicrobial activity showed a drastic drop (P < 0.05) in the percentage of inhibition. Concentrations of the inhibitive metabolites were produced in varying amounts and were strain dependent. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that lactic acid in all strains was produced in a more predominant amount than acetic acid. Protein concentration production ranged from 0.081-0.215 mg/mL. L. fermentum BD 1912d yielded as much as 0.014 mg/mL hydrogen peroxide, which was significantly higher than other strains studied. Diacetyl was produced in a higher concentration by Weissella cibaria FTDC 8643 at 2.884 ng/mL; the lowest concentration of 0.465 ng/mL was produced by Ped. pentosaceus BD 1913b. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial metabolites from CFS of lactic acid bacteria were effective in repressing the growth of opportunistic wounding dermal pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Characterization, identification and application of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  - There has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. This study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in China. One hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be LAB based on their Gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. These isolates were divided into eight groups (A-H) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. The Group A to H strains were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), L. casei (5.1%), Leuconostoc (Ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), Pediococcus (P.) pentosaceus (24.2%), Enterococcus (E.) mundtii (12.1%), Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae (15.2%), E. faecium (9.1%) and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16S rRNA and recA genes. P. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the LAB population in the paddy rice silage. A selected strain, namely L. casei R 465, was found to be able to grow under low pH conditions and to improve the silage quality with low pH and a relatively high content of lactic acid. This study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant LAB species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with LAB, and that strain R 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.
TI  - Reduction of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium DT104 infection in experimentally challenged weaned pigs fed a lactobacillus-fermented feed.
AB  - Salmonella Typhimurium is a foodborne pathogen and commonly present on pig farms. Probiotics have shown potential as a means of reducing Salmonella shedding in pigs. Three experimental challenge trials were conducted to investigate the potential application of newly isolated Lactobacillus isolates for controlling Salmonella infection in pigs. In each trial, 16 Yorkshire piglets (28-d old) were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: (1) basal diet (BD), (2) naturally fermented (NF) feed, (3) Lactobacillus zeae-fermented (LZ-F) feed, and 4) Lactobacillus casei-fermented (LC-F) feed. All pigs consumed their assigned diets for 3 d prior to the challenge of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 (approximately 6 log colony-forming units/pig) through gavage. Pediococcus pentosaceus, L. zeae, and L. casei were most abundant in NF, LZ-F, and LC-F feed, respectively. After the challenge, pigs on fermented feed had lower rectal temperature, diarrhea scores, serum haptoglobin concentrations, and intestinal Salmonella counts than the control group (BD) (p </= 0.01). Salmonella spp. were detected in both ileocecal lymph nodes (ICLN) and spleens from all pigs on BD, NF, and LC-F, but only 50% of spleens from pigs on LZ-F. Pigs had a dynamic spatial and temporal immune response to Salmonella infection and dietary treatments, as indicated by up- and downregulation in gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor) in the ileum, ICLN, and spleen. The alternation in cytokine expression by fermented feed, particularly LZ-F, appeared to benefit pigs in combating Salmonella infection.
TI  - Control of spoilage fungi by protective lactic acid bacteria displaying probiotic properties.
AB  - Thirty-six lactic acid bacteria belong to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Pediococcus were isolated, and the spectrum of antifungal activity was verified against Fusarium oxysporum (KACC 42109), Aspergillus niger (KACC 42589), Fusarium moniliforme (KACC 08141), Penicillium chrysogenum (NII 08137), and the yeast Candida albicans (MTCC 3017). Three isolates, identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus (TG2), Lactobacillus casei (DY2), and Lactococcus (BSN) were selected further, and their antifungal compounds were identified by ESI-MS and HPLC analysis as a range of carboxylic acids along with some unidentified, higher molecular weight compounds. An attempt to check out the shelf life extension of wheat bread without fungal spoilage was performed by fermenting the dough with the Lactococcus isolate. Apart from growth in low pH and tolerance to bile salts, probiotic potential of these three isolates was further substantiated by in vitro screening methods that include transit tolerance to the conditions in the upper human gastrointestinal tract and bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines.
TI  - Identification of thermo tolerant lactic acid bacteria isolated from silage prepared in the hot and humid climate of Southwestern Japan.
AB  - To develop high-quality silage starters adapted to hot and humid weather, 12 LAB  isolates from silage produced in Kyushu and Okinawa, Japan were characterized based on their morphological features, growth curves and sugar utilization. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of the V2-V3 region of their 16S rRNA genes and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS) regions were determined. The isolates were also subjected to RAPD-PCR analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, G+C content analysis and immuno-identification using species-specific monoclonal antibodies and SDS-PAGE profiling. Nearly all of the isolates exhibited high thermotolerance and rapid growth. Combining ITS sequence analysis, RAPD-PCR and immuno-identification enabled rapid and accurate identification of closely related LAB strains that other methods failed to appropriately differentiate; for example, L. plantarum was distinguished from L. pentosus, and L. casei was distinguished from L. rhamonsus. Using the aforementioned techniques, the isolated strains were identified as L. plantarum, L. rhamonsus, L. rapi, Pediococcus pentosaceus and P. lolii. Our findings also showed that there is greater diversity among thermophilic LABs in silage prepared in a hot and humid environment.
TI  - Putrescine production from different amino acid precursors by lactic acid bacteria from wine and cider.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the production of biogenic amines and particularly putrescine in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) related to wine and cider. We applied an analytical protocol that involves the use of PCR and TLC techniques to determine the production of putrescine from different precursors. Moreover, we also studied the ability of the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus tested to produce histamine and tyramine. The results showed that the majority of the Lactobacillus brevis analyzed harbour both AgDI and tdc genes and are tyramine and putrescine producers. Conversely, among the other LAB tested, only one Lactobacillus hilgardii and one Pediococcus pentosaceus produced putrescine. The AgDI gene was also detected in two other LAB (Lactobacillus mali and Pediococcus parvulus), but no putrescine production was observed. Finally, hdc gene and histamine production were found in strains (L. hilgardii 5211, isolated from wine, and Lactobacillus casei 18, isolated from cider) that were not putrescine producers.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - Biodiversity of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in the fermentation of "Shanxi aged vinegar", a traditional Chinese vinegar.
AB  - Shanxi aged vinegar is a famous traditional Chinese vinegar made from several kinds of cereal by spontaneous solid-state fermentation techniques. In order to get a comprehensive understanding of culturable microorganism's diversity present in its fermentation, the indigenous microorganisms including 47 yeast isolates, 28 lactic acid bacteria isolates and 58 acetic acid bacteria isolates were recovered in different fermenting time and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including inter-delta/PCR, PCR-RFLP, ERIC/PCR analysis, as well as 16S rRNA and 26S rRNA partial gene sequencing. In the alcoholic fermentation, the dominant yeast species Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae (96%) exhibited low phenotypic and genotypic diversity among the isolates, while Lactobacillus (Lb.) fermentum together with Lb. plantarum, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Pediococcus (P.) acidilactici, P. pentosaceus and Weissella confusa were predominated in the bacterial population at the same stage. Acetobacter (A.) pasteurianus showing great variety both in genotypic and phenotypic tests was the dominant species (76%) in the acetic acid fermentation stage, while the other acetic acid bacteria species including A. senegalensis, A. indonesiensis, A. malorum and A. orientalis, as well as Gluconobacter (G.) oxydans were detected at initial point of alcoholic and acetic acid fermentation stage respectively.
TI  - LysA2, the Lactobacillus casei bacteriophage A2 lysin is an endopeptidase active  on a wide spectrum of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The lysin gene (lysA2) of the Lactobacillus casei bacteriophage A2 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. LysA2 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the terminal D: -alanine of the peptidoglycan tetrapeptide and the aspartic acid residue that forms the bridge with the L: -lysine of a neighboring peptidoglycan chain, characteristic of Gram-positive bacteria included into the A4 peptidoglycan subgroup. This includes most lactobacilli, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Pediococcus pentosaceus, the walls of all of which were substrates for the enzyme. Specific binding of LysA2 to the wall of these bacteria is mediated by its C-terminal moiety, does not need the N-terminal catalytic domain for recognition, and is stable: at least 88% of the molecules were still bound to L. casei after 3 days in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees C. The enzyme acts as a monomer, is active at pH values between 4 and 6, and at temperatures ranging between 18 degrees C and 50 degrees C while being independent of divalent cation addition. The enzyme showed strong resistance to incubation at high and low pH values but became progressively inactivated at 50 degrees C and above. LysA2 is bactericidal, the viability of L. casei cultures dropping to 1% in 10 min, under the standard conditions used for the enzymatic assay.
TI  - Comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during Montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  - The microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. During milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. Recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. In this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of Montasio cheese was provided. A combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. Culture-dependent identification was compared with 16S clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA (cDNA) amplification and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp.). S. thermophilus was the predominant LAB species throughout the entire ripening period of Montasio cheese. The culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of Pseudomonas spp. and Lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. The culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.
TI  - Tyrosine- and histidine-decarboxylase positive lactic acid bacteria and enterococci in dry fermented sausages.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and enterococci were isolated immediately after stuffing (day 0), at the end of ripening (28th day) and at the end of storage (112th day) from dry fermented sausages produced by two different producers (K; R) in two diameters (4.5 and 7 cm) using either of two spice mixtures (P; H) and either of two starter cultures (Pediococcus pentosaceus, C; Lactobacillus curvatus+Staphylococcus carnosus, F), resulting in a total of 16 different combinations. Tyrosine-decarboxylase DNA sequence (tyrdc) was identified on average in 88% and 44% of enterococci and LAB isolates, respectively at the end of ripening, the corresponding figures regarding histidine-decarboxylase gene sequence (hisdc) was 71% and 16%, respectively. Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis and L. casei/paracasei, and Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as tyramine/histamine producers in the sausages.
TI  - Robustness of Lactobacillus plantarum starters during daily propagation of wheat  flour sourdough type I.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the robustness of selected sourdough strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Seven strains were singly used as sourdough type I starters under daily back-slopping propagation (ten days) using wheat flour. Cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied slightly (median values of 9.13-9.46 log cfu g(-1)) between and within started sourdoughs, as well as the acidifying activity (median values of 1.24-1.33). After three days also the control sourdough (unstarted) had the same values. As shown by RAPD-PCR analysis, five (DB200, 3DM, G10C3, 12H1 and LP20) out of seven strains maintained elevated cell numbers (ca. 9 log cfu g(-1)) throughout ten days. The other two strains progressively decreased to less than 5 log cfu g(-1). As identified by partial sequencing of 16S rRNA and recA genes, L. plantarum (11 isolates), pediococci (7), Lactobacillus casei (3) and Lactobacillus rossiae (2) dominated the flour microbiota. Monitoring of lactic acid bacteria during sourdough propagation was carried out by culture dependent approach and using PCR-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis). Except for the sourdough started with L. plantarum LP20, in all other sourdoughs at least one autochthonous strain of L. plantarum emerged. All emerging strains of L. plantarum showed different RAPD-PCR profiles. L. rossiae and Pediococcus pentosaceus were only found in the control and sourdough started with strain 12H1. The characterization of the catabolic profiles of sourdoughs (Biolog System) showed that sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and their profiles were clearly differentiated from the others. One persistent strain (DB200) of L. plantarum and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis LS44, previously shown to be persistent (Siragusa et al., 2009), were used as the mixed starter to produce a wheat flour sourdough. Both strains cohabited and dominated during ten days of propagation.
TI  - Effects of pure starter cultures on physico-chemical and sensory quality of dry fermented Chinese-style sausage.
AB  - Dry fermented Chinese-style sausages prepared in laboratory inoculating with Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei-1.001, Pediococcus pentosaceus-ATCC 33316, Staphylococcus xylosus-12 and without starter culture randomly sampled at 0, 3, 10, and 24 days of ripening were analyzed for physico-chemical and sensory qualities. A significant (p<0.05) decrease in moisture content of sausage during ripening was observed, whereas other major chemical parameters remained unchanged. The microbial fermentation resulted in decreased pH and nitrite but increased non protein nitrogen and total volatile basic nitrogen in the products. Starter cultures except P. Pentosaceous-ATCC 33316, used in the sausage failed to suppress rancidity in ripened product as indicated by a significant (p<0.05) rise in thiobarbituric acid. The lightness (L) and yellowness (b) in the colour of all sausages decreased with ripening time, meanwhile the redness (a) increased significantly (p<0.05) in sausages inoculated with cultures L. casei subsp. casei-1.001 and S. xylosus-12. The texture profile of sausages was almost similar except for P. Pentosaceous-ATCC 33316, which showed significantly (p<0.05) lower hardness and gumminess. Based on the sensory and physico-chemical quality criteria, S. xylosus-12 could be used as a starter culture to produce dry fermented Chinese-style sausage of high quality.
TI  - Development of a PCR assay for the strain-specific identification of probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1.
AB  - Recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health. In this study, strain IMPC2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a PCR test for strain-specific identification. Molecular methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiplex PCR, have provided evidence that strain IMPC2.1 indeed belongs to the L. paracasei species. In addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-AFLP) data strongly indicated that strain IMPC2.1 and nine other L. paracasei strains (including strain ATCC 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain L. casei ATCC 393. The f-AFLP technique was also used to identify a strain-specific DNA fragment of L. paracasei IMPC2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid PCR test for strain-specific identification. The strain-specificity of the PCR test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. These strains belonged to the L. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of Lactobacillus and to Weissella cibaria, W. confusa, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - A survey of the microbial and chemical composition of seven semi-ripened Provola  dei Nebrodi Sicilian cheeses.
AB  - AIMS: The microbial and chemical composition of seven different semi-ripened (45  days) Provola dei Nebrodi Sicilian cheese samples were assessed in order to investigate the diversity of the microbial population in cheese made from different geographical areas throughout Sicily. METHODS AND RESULTS: The samples, which were obtained from seven different Provola dei Nebrodi manufacturers, were assessed using selective media. Interestingly, concentrations of presumptive lactobacilli represented over 90% of the total microbial population. In total, 105 presumptive Lactobacillus isolates were characterized to determine the relatedness of the isolates between the seven different cheeses. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD PCR) analysis of the 105 presumptive lactobacilli indicated the presence of 22 distinct isolates. Further investigation of the isolates using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) following restriction with the enzyme ApaI revealed the presence of 19 distinct macrorestriction patterns and the presence of between one and four distinct isolates per cheese sample (out of a total of 15 isolates per cheese randomly taken from Lactobacillus selective media plates). Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of each genetically distinct isolate demonstrated the dominance of the Lactobacillus casei species in all cheese samples assessed. Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Pediococcus pentosaceus species were also detected. The concentration of free amino acids, used to estimate the extent of proteolysis in each cheese, ranged from 59 to 433 mg 100 g(-1) cheese. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological assessment of the cheeses demonstrated the dominance of Lactobacillus species after 45 days of ripening with levels ranging from 8.3 to 9.4 log CFU g(-1). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides new information on the diversity of lactobacilli within an artisanal Sicilian cheese, enabling the identification of 17 strains of Lact. casei, one strain of Lact. delbrueckii and Ped. pentosaceus through the combined use of RAPD PCR, PFGE and 16S rDNA sequencing.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Non-enterococcal Gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious infections. However, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. Because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the MICs of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. The activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; Lactobacillus casei, 1; Lactobacillus fermentum, 2; Lactobacillus brevis, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1; Weissella confusa, 2; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; Leuconostoc lactis, 4; Pediococcus acidilactici, 2; Pediococcus pentosaceus, 1), isolated from clinical specimens in an Argentinian university hospital from 1997 to 2003. The MICs of penicillin for 67% of the Lactobacillus strains and 100% of the Leuconostoc spp. and Pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/mL range. Erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. Multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1).
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - The effect of prebiotics on production of antimicrobial compounds, resistance to  growth at low pH and in the presence of bile, and adhesion of probiotic cells to intestinal mucus.
AB  - AIMS: Screening of five bile salt-resistant and low pH-tolerant lactic acid bacteria for inhibitory activity against lactic acid bacteria and bacterial strains isolated from the faeces of children with HIV/AIDS. Determining the effect of prebiotics and soy milk-base on cell viability and adhesion of cells to intestinal mucus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum 423, Lactobacillus casei LHS, Lactobacillus salivarius 241, Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38 and Pediococcus pentosaceus 34 produced the highest level of antimicrobial activity (12,800 AU ml(-1)) when grown in MRS broth supplemented with 2% (m/v) dextrose. Growth in the presence of Raftilose Synergy1, Raftilose L95 and Raftiline GR did not lead to increased levels of antimicrobial activity. Cells grown in the presence of Raftilose Synergy1 took longer to adhere to intestinal mucus, whilst cells grown in the absence of prebiotics showed a linear rate of binding. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited. Dextrose stimulated the production of antimicrobial compounds. Adhesion to intestinal mucus did not increase with the addition of prebiotics. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strains may be incorporated in food supplements for HIV/AIDS patients suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, structural organization and host range of pRS4, a small cryptic Pediococcus pentosaceus plasmid that contains two cassettes commonly found in other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the cryptic plasmid pRS4 (3550 bp) from Pediococcus pentosaceus RS4 was determined. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs). The putative protein coded by ORF 1 showed 93% identity with the mobilization protein of Lactobacillus casei plasmid pLC88 and 94% identity with a sequenced fragment of the mobilization protein of P. damnosus plasmid pF8801, suggesting a common origin for these three mobilization proteins. The putative protein coded by ORF 2 showed 92% identity with the replication protein of L. plantarum plasmid pWCFS101, a plasmid that replicates via the rolling circle (RC) mechanism, suggesting a similar replication mechanism for pRS4. Supporting this hypothesis, a putative double strand origin (dso) and a region with palindromic sequences that could function as single strand origin (sso), were detected in pRS4. A function could not be assigned to ORF 3. Since ORF 1 exhibits high identity with L. casei plasmid pLC88 but lower identity (58%) with other Lactobacillus plasmids, and ORF 2 exhibits high identity with the L. plantarum plasmid pWCFS101 but lower identity (55-58%) with other Lactobacillus plasmids (including pLC88), two independent cassettes, from different sources, seem to be involved in the structure of pRS4. Plasmids derived from pRS4 containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene were successfully electrotransformed in L. plantarum, L. casei, P. pentosaceus, and Pediococcus acidilactici, suggesting that pRS4 could be used as a cloning vector for lactic acid bacteria. To our knowledge pRS4 is the first RC-replicating plasmid of P. pentosaceus that has been completely sequenced and used as cloning vector.
TI  - Use of hydrolysates from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) viscera as a complex nitrogen source for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Hydrolysates of cod viscera were tested as an alternative to commonly used complex nitrogen sources (peptones and/or extracts) for the type strains of the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Comparative studies with MRS-like media containing different nitrogen sources showed that all the fish hydrolysates performed equally well or better than commercial extracts/peptones for all selected lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Enumeration and identification of pediococci in powder-based products using selective media and rapid PFGE.
AB  - In this study, pediococci selective medium (PSM) was evaluated for the enumeration of Pediococcus acidilactici and Pediococcus pentosaceus from probiotic animal feed and silage inoculants. PSM is based on the complex basal medium MRS supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride, novobiocin, vancomycin, and nystatin. No significant change in electivity was observed when pediococci where recovered from culture or powder-based products following incubation at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 24 h. The medium was suitable for the enumeration of pediococci in samples also containing bacilli, bifidobacteria, enterococci, lactobacilli, lactococci, propionibacteria, streptococci, and yeast components. However, to inhibit Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei, ampicillin was added and the revised medium, termed PSM+A, was also considered to be suitably elective for pediococci recovered from powder. In addition, a rapid PFGE protocol is presented, which allows Pediococcus species and strain verification from colonies in less than 3 days.
TI  - Biodiversity of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains isolated from five sourdoughs.
AB  - AIMS: Five different sourdoughs were investigated for the composition of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the biodiversity of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 57 strains were isolated from five sourdoughs. Isolated strains were all identified by the 16S rDNA sequence and species-specific primers for L. sanfranciscensis. Results of identification showed that LAB strains were L. sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus pontis, Lactobacillus casei, Weisella confusa and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A total of 21 strains were identified as L. sanfranciscensis and these isolates were detected in all five sourdoughs. Ribotyping was applied to investigate the relationship between intraspecies diversity of L. sanfranciscensis and sourdough. A total of 22 strains of L. sanfranciscensis including L. sanfranciscensis JCM 5668T were compared by ribotyping. The dendrogram of 21 ribotyping patterns showed four clusters, and L. sanfranciscensis JCM 5668T was independent of the others. The different biotypes of L. sanfranciscensis were present in two sourdoughs compared with other three sourdoughs. CONCLUSIONS: The LAB compositions of five sourdoughs were different and the relationship between intraspecies diversity of L. sanfranciscensis strains and five sourdoughs was shown by ribotyping. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that ribotyping was useful for distinguishing L. sanfranciscensis strains. A further important result is that the intra-species diversity of L. sanfranciscensis strains seems to be related to the sourdough preparation.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - The effects of using lactic acid bacteria inoculants in maize silage on the formation of biogenic amines.
AB  - Silages from five ripened varieties of silage maize with dry matter contents ranging between 275 and 410 g/kg were prepared in five laboratory experiments. Whole-plant maize was fermented at 22 degrees C and silages were then stored at the same temperature for 4 months. Spontaneously fermented silages were prepared as control variants and compared with silages inoculated with commercial strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobzcillus buchneri and a mixed preparation Microsil containing L. plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The starter cultures were applied at doses 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6) CFU/g of chopped maize. Seven biogenic amines and polyamines were extracted from silages with perchloric acid and determined as N-benzamides by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. Common chemical criteria of silage quality were also determined. All three inoculants, mainly at the higher dose, decreased significantly contents of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine, three undesirable amines occurring at the highest levels. L. plantarum was the most effective. Contents of histamine and tryptamine were low in all experimental silages. Also relatively low were levels of polyamines spermidine and mainly of spermine.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Characterization and identification of Pediococcus species isolated from forage crops and their application for silage preparation.
AB  - Pediococcus species isolated from forage crops were characterized, and their application to silage preparation was studied. Most isolates were distributed on forage crops at low frequency. These isolates could be divided into three (A, B, and C) groups by their sugar fermentation patterns. Strains LA 3, LA 35, and LS 5 are representative isolates from groups A, B, and C, respectively. Strains LA 3 and LA 35 had intragroup DNA homology values above 93.6%, showing that they belong to the species Pediococcus acidilactici. Strain LS 5 belonged to Pediococcus pentosaceus on the basis of DNA-DNA relatedness. All three of these strains and strain SL 1 (Lactobacillus casei, isolated from a commercial inoculant) were used as additives to alfalfa and Italian ryegrass silage preparation at two temperatures (25 and 48 degrees C). When stored at 25 degrees C, all of the inoculated silages were well preserved and exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) reduced fermentation losses compared to that of their control in alfalfa and Italian ryegrass silages. When stored at 48 degrees C, silages inoculated with strains LA 3 and LA 35 were also well preserved, with a significantly (P < 0.05) lower pH, butyric acid and ammonia-nitrogen content, gas production, and dry matter loss and significantly (P < 0.05) higher lactate content than the control, but silages inoculated with LS 5 and SL 1 were of poor quality. P. acidilactici LA 3 and LA 35 are considered suitable as potential silage inoculants.
TI  - Chemical composition of the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  - In order to examine the relationship between biological activities and the cell wall content, the murein type and the teichoic acid of the cell wall from five strains of bacteria were studied. Two of these Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 and L. acidophilus CRL 730, are used in a commercial fermented milk (BIO MILK), which is believed to be beneficial for health. The other strains, Lactococcus lactis CRL 526, Pediococcus pentosaceus CRL 923 and Propionibacterium acidipropionici CRL 1198 were included in order to compare the cell wall structures of active and inactive strains. A method was designed to confirm the amino acids of the peptidoglycan in impure substrates. Four of the studied strains, L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. lactis and P. acidipropionici, contained glycerol teichoic acids. L. casei, L. acidophilus, P. pentosaceus and L. lactis contained A4 alpha type murein, while P. acidipropionici contained A3 gamma type. The capacity of orally administered peptidoglycans of the studied strains to stimulate phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages was analyzed. Only the PG of L. casei showed this activity. No differences were observed between active and inactive strains with respect to the chemical composition of the peptidoglycan. Therefore the biological activity is unlikely to be due to the peptidoglycan structure.
TI  - The effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - beta-Galactosidases from Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, Lb. casei 20094, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, Streptococcus thermophilus TS2, Pediococcus pentosaceus PE39 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. The rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by Mg2+, while the effect of K+ and Na+ differed from strain to strain. The beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. The types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in each case, but the rates of their production differed. All the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, Lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 by organic acids and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study the effects of both pH and organic acids on Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 were tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. casei, Lact. bulgaricus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Bifidobacterium bifidus were assayed for their lactic acid production, pH and inhibition of H. pylori growth. A standard antimicrobial plate well diffusion assay was employed to examine inhibitory effects. Lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids demonstrated inhibition of H. pylori growth in a concentration-dependent manner with the lactic acid demonstrating the greatest inhibition. This inhibition was due both to the pH of the solution and its concentration. Six strains of Lact. acidophilus and one strain of Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus inhibited H. pylori growth where as Bifidobacterium bifidus, Ped. pentosaceus and Lact. bulgaricus did not. Concentrations of lactic acid produced by these strains ranged from 50 to 156 mmol l-1 and correlated with H. pylori inhibition. The role of probiotic organisms and their metabolic by-products in the eradication of H. pylori in vivo remains to be determined.
TI  - Modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant VANB-type Enterococcus D366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  - The biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan UDP-MurNAc-peptide precursors. In all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the C-terminal D-Ala-D-Ala-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified C terminus. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in Enterococcus faecium D366, a strain belonging to the VANB class, which expresses low-level resistance to vancomycin, was UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-lactate, identical to that previously found in the VANA class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. High-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by R39 D,D-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in Lactobacillus casei and Pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. The low-level natural resistance of Enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide containing a C-terminal D-serine. The distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a D-Ala-D-Ala-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide.
TI  - Plasmid-Associated Bacteriocin Production and Sucrose Fermentation in Pediococcus acidilactici.
AB  - Production of bacteriocin activity designated pediocin PA-1 was associated with the presence of a 6.2-megadalton plasmid in Pediococcus acidilactici PAC1.0. The bacteriocin exhibited activity against P. acidilactici, P. pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. bifermentans, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. Partial characterization of pediocin PA-1 is described. The molecular weight of pediocin PA-1 was ca. 16,500. Additionally, strain PAC1.0 was found to contain a 23-megadalton plasmid associated with sucrose-fermenting ability.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
