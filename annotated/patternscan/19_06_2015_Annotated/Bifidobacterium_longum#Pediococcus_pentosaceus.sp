TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == the combination of mixed lactic acid bacteria and dietary fiber lowers serum cholesterol levels and fecal harmful enzyme activities in rats.
AB  == probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria (lab) and prebiotics such as fiber are generally considered beneficial for health. these affect the microflora composition and fermentation metabolites and consequently contribute to local and systemic effects in humans. the beneficial effects of probiotics can be improved  when combined with prebiotics. here we investigated the effects of a mixed lab supplement combined with dietary fiber on the population of lab in the gut, as well as on serum cholesterol levels, fecal water content and microbial harmful enzyme activities. for animal studies, 0.2 ml of mixed lab (bifidobacterium longum spm1205, lactobacillus acidophilus, and safelac isolated from pediococcus  pentosaceus) supplement (10(7) approximately 10(8) colony forming units per day)  was orally administered to male sprague-dawley rats every day for 2 weeks along with a diet containing 5% or 10% cellulose. the mixed lab supplement combined with dietary cellulose significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum total cholesterol and ldl levels. this combination also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the population of lab and the fecal water content and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced microbial harmful enzyme (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase) activities. these effects of lab were particularly improved by its combination with 5% cellulose compared to the control (a diet without cellulose), and the 5% cellulose combination was more effective than the 10% cellulose combination. in conclusion, the incorporation of a fibrous diet such as cellulose with lactic acid bacteria improved the population of lab, and daily consumption of this combination could reduce the serum cholesterol levels and activities of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, tryptophanase, urease in rats.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in dry fermented sausages containing micro-encapsulated probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is capable of surviving the rigorous processing steps during the manufacture of dry fermented sausages. the effect of adding two probiotic organisms, lactobacillus reuteri and bifidobacterium longum as co-cultures with the meat starter cultures pediococcus pentosaceus and staphylococcus carnosus on the viability of e. coli o157:h7 in dry fermented sausages was studied. a 5 strain cocktail of e. coli o157:h7 was added at 7.4 log cfu/g to the sausage batter and challenged with either or both lb. reuteri or b.  longum before or after they were micro-encapsulated. sausages were fermented at < or = 26 degrees c and 88% relative humidity (rh) followed by drying at 75% rh and 13 degrees c for 25 d. the ph, water activity (aw), protein, moisture, and numbers of all inoculated organisms were monitored during processing. the ph and  aw decreased from 5.7 and 0.98 to 4.9 and 0.88 at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. these processes reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 1.0 and 0.7 log  cfu/g at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. unencapsulated lb. reuteri with or without b. longum reduced e. coli o157:h7 by 3.0 log cfu/g and b. longum caused a 1.9 log cfu/g reduction. while micro-encapsulation increased survival of lb. reuteri and b. longum, it reduced their inhibitory action against e. coli o157:h7.
