TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Preparative scale purification of fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides and their evaluation as potential prebiotics and antiadhesins.
AB  - Fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides are important core structures that form part of human mucosal and milk glyco-complexes. We have previously shown that AlfB and AlfC alpha-L-fucosidases from Lactobacillus casei are able to synthesize fucosyl-alpha-1,3--N-acetylglucosamine (Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc) and fucosyl-alpha-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (Fuc-alpha1,6-GlcNAc), respectively, in transglycosylation reactions. Here, these reactions were performed in a semipreparative scale, and the produced disaccharides were purified. The maximum yields obtained of Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc and Fuc-alpha1,6-GlcNAc were 4.2 and 9.3 g/l, respectively. The purified fucosyl-disaccharides were then analyzed for their prebiotic effect in vitro using strains from the Lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus group and from Bifidobacterium species. The results revealed that 6 out of 11 L. casei strains and 2 out of 6 L. rhamnosus strains tested were able to ferment Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc, and L. casei BL87 and L. rhamnosus BL327 strains were also able to ferment Fuc-alpha1,6-GlcNAc. DNA hybridization experiments suggested that the metabolism of Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc in those strains relies in an alpha-L-fucosidase homologous to AlfB. Bifidobacterium breve and Bibidobacterium pseudocatenolatum species also metabolized Fuc-alpha1,3-GlcNAc. Notably, L-fucose was excreted from all the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains fermenting fucosyl-disaccharides, except from strains L. rhamnosus BL358 and BL377, indicating that in these latest strains, L-fucose was catabolized. The fucosyl-disaccharides were also tested for their inhibitory potential of pathogen adhesion to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (HT29) cell line. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains isolated from infantile gastroenteritis were used, and the results showed that both fucosyl-disaccharides inhibited adhesion to different extents of certain EPEC strains to HT29 cells in tissue culture.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  - Kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. It is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health benefits. It has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. There are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. In this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented Vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. Glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. Four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. Our findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. This study illustrates the potential of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.
TI  - Functional properties of peanut fractions on the growth of probiotics and foodborne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Various compounds found in peanut (Arachis hypogaea) have been shown to provide multiple benefits to human health and may influence the growth of a broad range of gut bacteria. In this study, we investigated the effects of peanut white kernel and peanut skin on 3 strains of Lactobacillus and 3 major foodborne enteric bacterial pathogens. Significant (P < 0.05) growth stimulation of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus was observed in the presence of 0.5% peanut flour (PF) made from peanut white kernel, whereas 0.5% peanut skin extract (PSE) exerted the inhibitory effect on the growth of these beneficial microbes. We also found that within 72 h, PF inhibited growth of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC), while PSE significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited Listeria monocytogenes but promoted the growth of both EHEC and Salmonella Typhimurium. The cell adhesion and invasion abilities of 3 pathogens to the host cells were also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by 0.5% PF and 0.5% PSE. These results suggest that peanut white kernel might assist in improving human gut flora as well as reducing EHEC, whereas the beneficial effects of peanut skins require further research and investigation.
TI  - Use of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus to Prevent Cholangitis in Biliary Atresia After Kasai Operation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recurrent cholangitis may aggravate cholestatic liver cirrhosis in biliary atresia (BA) after the Kasai operation. This pilot study aimed to investigate whether Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus has the prophylactic efficacy for recurrent cholangitis in comparison with the conventional neomycin prophylaxis. METHODS: Twenty jaundice-free patients with BA ages 0 to 3 years who underwent a Kasai operation were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups with 10 patients each: neomycin (25 mg . kg . day for 4 days/wk) and L casei rhamnosus (8 x 10 colony-forming unit per day) groups. The treatment duration was 6 months. Bacterial stool cultures were performed before treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months after starting treatment. In addition, 10 patients with BA with similar status but without prophylaxis served as the historical control group. RESULTS: In the Lactobacillus group, 2 patients (20%, mean 0.03 +/- 0.07 episodes per month) developed cholangitis during the study period, with the same frequency as in the neomycin group and significantly lower than that in the control group (80%, P = 0.005, mean 0.22 +/- 0.16 episodes per month). The mean change in body weight z score during the 6 months in the Lactobacillus group was 0.97 +/- 0.59, which was significantly better than that in the control group (-0.01 +/- 0.79, P = 0.006). In bacterial stool cultures, the Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli populations significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the Lactobacillus group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of L casei rhamnosus was as effective as neomycin in preventing cholangitis in patients with BA who underwent Kasai operation, and therefore could be considered as a potential alternative prophylactic regimen.
TI  - Nature of the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus caseiBifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - Staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (CCUG ATCC(R) 25926) and Escherichia coli (ATCC(R) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC(R) 27853). Test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. Inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the pH of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. The results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium pH.
TI  - The use of the replication region of plasmid pRS7 from Oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A chimeric plasmid, pRS7Rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of pRS7, a large plasmid from Oenococcus oeni, and pEM64, a plasmid derived from pIJ2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. pRS7Rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in Escherichia coli using its pIJ2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using the replication region of pRS7. High levels of transformants per microg of DNA were obtained by electroporation of pRS7Rep into Pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), Lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), Lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), Leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and Enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). A preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that P. acidilactici and L. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas L. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. pRS7Rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, BamHI, XbaI, SalI, HincII, SphI and PstI, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in L. plantarum, but was less stable in L. casei and P. acidilactici. The ability of pRS7Rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from O. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.
TI  - Effect of KCl substitution on bacterial viability of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  - Excessive intake of NaCl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. Strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of NaCl with other salts, such as KCl. In this study, the effects of NaCl reduction and its substitution with KCl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (Escherichia coli) were investigated using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A critical NaCl concentration that inhibited the viability of E. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. To find the critical NaCl concentration, de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broth was supplemented with a range of NaCl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and FTIR spectra was monitored for all bacteria. A NaCl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of NaCl to inhibit E. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. The FTIR spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the NaCl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of the bacteria. Escherichia coli and B. longum were more sensitive to substitution of NaCl with KCl, compared with Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei, and Lc. lactis ssp. lactis. To evaluate the effect of substitution of NaCl with KCl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% KCl). The findings suggest that 50% substitution of NaCl with KCl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit E. coli without affecting the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Coexpression and secretion of endoglucanase and phytase genes in Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - A multifunctional transgenic Lactobacillus with probiotic characteristics and an  ability to degrade beta-glucan and phytic acid (phytate) was engineered to improve nutrient utilization, increase production performance and decrease digestive diseases in broiler chickens. The Bacillus subtilis WL001 endoglucanase gene (celW) and Aspergillus fumigatus WL002 phytase gene (phyW) mature peptide (phyWM) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of Lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the Lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. This construct was then transformed into Lactobacillus reuteri XC1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of broilers. Heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified L. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phyWM and celW was approximately 48.2 and 55 kDa, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. Endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed L. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 U/mL, respectively. Transformed L. reuteri improved the feed conversion ratio of broilers from 21 to 42 days of age and over the whole feeding period. However, there was no effect on body weight gain and feed intake of chicks. Transformed L. reuteri supplementation improved levels of ash, calcium and phosphorus in tibiae at day 21 and of phosphorus at day 42. In addition, populations of Escherichia coli, Veillonella spp. and Bacteroides vulgatus were decreased, while populations of Bifidobacterium genus and Lactobacillus spp. were increased in the cecum at day 21.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and room-temperature X-ray diffraction of inositol  dehydrogenase LcIDH2 from Lactobacillus casei BL23.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei BL23 contains two genes, iolG1 and iolG2, homologous with inositol dehydrogenase encoding genes from many bacteria. Inositol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of inositol with concomitant reduction of NAD+. The protein encoded by iolG2, LcIDH2, has been purified to homogeneity, crystallized and cryoprotected for diffraction at 77 K. The crystals had a high mosaicity and poor processing statistics. Subsequent diffraction measurements were performed without cryoprotectant at room temperature. These crystals were radiation-resistant and a full diffraction data set was collected at room temperature to 1.6 A resolution.
TI  - Characterisation and preliminary lipid-lowering evaluation of Lactobacillus isolated from a traditional Serbian dairy product.
AB  - We investigated the potential probiotic properties of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Serbian homemade cheese. Seventeen LAB strains were isolated and characterised using standard protocols. One of the strains showed several probiotic properties: survival at low pH and in bile salts solution, antimicrobial activity, susceptibility to antibiotics and adhesion to hexodecane. DNA analysis identified the isolate as Lactobacillus casei, hereafter named L. casei 5s. The lipid lowering effect of L. casei 5s was evaluated in vivo using a hyperlipidemic rat model. Orally administered L. casei 5s significantly decreased the elevated total serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and attenuated macro vesicular steatosis in the liver. Moreover, L. casei 5s improved the intestinal microbial balance in favour of lactobacilli, while decreasing the number of Escherichia coli cells. The bacteria were re-isolated and identified from the surface of the intestinal mucosa and from the faecal samples of treated animals, indicating adhesiveness and colonisation ability. The results of an acute oral toxicity study in mice and the absence of translocation to other organs demonstrated the safety of the strain. In conclusion, L. casei 5s demonstrated promising probiotic potential and might be a good candidate for more detailed investigations.
TI  - Angle-resolved light scattering of individual rod-shaped bacteria based on Fourier transform light scattering.
AB  - Two-dimensional angle-resolved light scattering maps of individual rod-shaped bacteria are measured at the single-cell level. Using quantitative phase imaging and Fourier transform light scattering techniques, the light scattering patterns of individual bacteria in four rod-shaped species (Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, Synechococcus elongatus, and Escherichia coli) are measured with unprecedented sensitivity in a broad angular range from -70 degrees to 70 degrees . The measured light scattering patterns are analyzed along the two principal axes of rod-shaped bacteria in order to systematically investigate the species-specific characteristics of anisotropic light scattering. In addition, the cellular dry mass of individual bacteria is calculated and used to demonstrate that the cell-to-cell variations in light scattering within bacterial species is related to the cellular dry mass and growth.
TI  - Study of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus strains as probiotics on multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (UTIs).
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by bacteria is one of the most frequent infections in human population. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, often leads to appearance of drug resistance in bacteria. However, use of probiotic bacteria has been suggested as a partial replacement. This study was aimed to assess the antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus standard strains against bacteria isolated from UTI infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 600 samples; those with >/=10,000 cfu/ml were selected as UTI positive samples. Enterococcus sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli were found the most prevalent UTI causative agents. All isolates were screened for multi drug resistance and subjected to the antimicrobial effects of three Lactobacillus strains by using microplate technique and the MICs amounts were determined. In order to verify the origin of antibiotic resistance of isolates, plasmid curing using ethidium bromide and acridine orange was carried out. RESULTS: No antagonistic activity in Lactobacilli suspension was detected against test on Enterococcus and Enterobacter strains and K. pneumoniae, which were resistant to most antibiotics. However, an inhibitory effect was observed for E. coli which were resistant to 8-9 antibiotics. In addition, L. casei was determined to be the most effective probiotic. RESULTS from replica plating suggested one of the plasmids could be related to the gene responsible for ampicillin resistance. CONCLUSION: Treatment of E. coli with probiotic suspension was not effective on inhibition of the plasmid carrying hypothetical ampicillin resistant gene. Moreover, the plasmid profiles obtained from probiotic-treated isolates were identical to untreated isolates.
TI  - A mixture of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa reduces Escherichia coli O157:H7 in finishing feedlot cattle.
AB  - A direct-fed microbial (DFM) containing Paenibacillus polymyxa, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus lactis was fed to cattle (n = 120) to determine impacts on shedding and survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in feces. Cattle were individually penned and fed diets containing 0 (control), 4 x 10(7) CFU (DFM-4), 8 x 10(7) CFU (DFM-8), or 1.2 x 10(8) CFU (DFM-12) lactobacilli per kg of dietary dry matter over 84-day fall-winter growing and 140-day spring-summer finishing periods. Fecal grab samples were collected from cattle at 28-day intervals, E. coli O157:H7 was detected by immunomagnetic separation, and isolates were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. During the growing period, feces negative for E. coli O157 from each dietary treatment were inoculated with 10(5) CFU/g nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli O157:H7 and were incubated at 4 and 22(u) C for 11 weeks. Fecal pH and fecal dry matter were measured on days 0, 1, 3, and 7 and weekly thereafter, with E. coli O157:H7 enumerated through dilution plating. Treatment with DFMs did not affect survival of E. coli O157:H7 in feces or fecal pH (P > 0.05). Only one steer was positive for E. coli O157:H7 during the growing period, but during the finishing period, DFM-8 and DFM-12 reduced the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in feces (P < 0.05). Feeding DFMs also reduced the frequency of individual steers shedding E. coli O157:H7 during finishing (P < 0.05), with control steers shedding E. coli O157:H7 up to four times, whereas DFM-12 steers shed E. coli O157:H7 a maximum of twice. Treatment with DFMs influenced pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles; steers that were fed DFM-8 and DFM-12 shed more diverse subtypes of E. coli O157:H7 than did control or DFM-4 steers. Because a companion study found linear improvement in performance with increasing dosage of DFMs in the first 28 days of the growing period, targeted use of DFM-12 during this time and for the final 1 or 2 weeks prior to slaughter may optimize performance and reduce E. coli O157:H7 while minimizing feed costs.
TI  - Characterization of pMC11, a plasmid with dual origins of replication isolated from Lactobacillus casei MCJ and construction of shuttle vectors with each replicon.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria carry different plasmids, particularly those that replicate via a theta mechanism. Here we describe Lactobacillus casei MCJ(CCTCC AB20130356), a new isolate that contains pMC11, carrying two distinct theta-type replicons. Each replicon contained an iteron in the origin of replication (oriV1 or oriV2) and a gene coding for the replicase (RepA_1 or RepB_1), both of which are essential for plasmid replication. Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vectors were constructed with each replicon, yielding pEL5.7 and pEL5.6 that are based on oriV2 and oriV1 replicons, respectively. These plasmids showed distinct properties: pEL5.7 was capable of replicating in L. casei MCJDelta1 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 but failed to do so in two other tested lactobacilli strains whereas pEL5.6 replicated in three different strains, including L. casei MCJDelta1, L. casei NJ, Lactobacillus paracasei LPC-37 and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1. Plasmid stability was studied: pEL5.6 and pEL5.7 were very stably maintained in L. casei, as the loss rate was lower than 1 % per generation. pEL5.7 was also stable in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 with the loss rate estimated to be 3 %. These vectors were employed to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) using the promoter of S-layer protein SlpA from Lactobacillus acidophilus. And a growth-phase regulated expression of GFP was observed in different strains. In conclusion, these shuttle vectors provide efficient genetic tools for DNA cloning and heterologous gene expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine kappa-casein and the fractions (named kappaC1, kappaC2, kappaC3, kappaC4, and kappaC5) liberated from it using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). Three peptides (kC1, kC3, and kC4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with kappaC3 peptide being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine kappa-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. The three antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular mass of kC1, kC3, and kC4 corresponded to the f(17-21), f(22-24), and f(1-3) of bovine kappa-casein, respectively. It was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of kappa-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.
TI  - Noroviral p-particles as an in vitro model to assess the interactions of noroviruses with probiotics.
AB  - Noroviruses (NoVs) are the main etiologic agents of acute epidemic gastroenteritis and probiotic bacteria have been reported to exert a positive effect on viral diarrhea. The protruding (P) domain from NoVs VP1 capsid protein has the ability to assemble into the so-called P-particles, which retain the binding ability to host receptors. We purified the P-domains from NoVs genotypes GI.1 and GII.4 as 6X(His)-tagged proteins and determined that, similar to native domains, they were structured into P-particles that were functional in the recognition of the specific glycoconjugated receptors, as established by surface plasmon resonance experiments. We showed that several lactic acid bacteria (probiotic and non-probiotic) and a Gram-negative probiotic strain have the ability to bind P-particles on their surfaces irrespective of their probiotic status. The binding of P-particles (GI.1) to HT-29 cells in the presence of selected strains showed that bacteria can inhibit P-particle attachment in competitive exclusion experiments. However, pre-treatment of cells with bacteria or adding bacteria to cells with already attached P-particles enhanced the retention of the particles. Although direct viral binding and blocking of viral receptors have been postulated as mechanisms of protection against viral infection by probiotic bacteria, these results highlight the need for a careful evaluation of this hypothesis. The work presented here investigates for the first time the probiotic-NoVs-host interactions and points up the NoVs P-particles as useful tools to overcome the absence of in vitro cellular models to propagate these viruses.
TI  - Passive protection of mice pups through oral or intranasal immunization of dams with recombinant Lactobacillus casei vaccine against ETEC F41.
AB  - Mucosal immunization is advantageous over other routes of antigen delivery because it can induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses. In this study, we have developed fimbriae protein of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F41 was stably expressed on the surface Lactobacillus casei 525. The method of expressing vaccine antigens in L. casei induces both systemic and mucosal immunity after oral or intranasal administration. We demonstrate that an oral or intranasal vaccine based on live recombinant L. casei 525 protects infant mice from ETEC F41 infection. This platform technology can be applied to design oral or intranasal vaccine delivery vehicles against several microbial pathogens.
TI  - Differential expression of cro, the lysogenic cycle repressor determinant of bacteriophage A2, in Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Expression of bacteriophage A2-encoded cro in Escherichia coli gives rise to two  co-linear polypeptides, Cro and Cro*, which were proposed to form a regulatory tandem to modulate the frequency with which the phage would choose between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles. In this communication, it is reported that Cro is the canonical product of the gene cro while Cro* results from a -1 ribosome frameshift during translation and is twelve amino acids shorter than Cro. However, frameshifting was not observed during phage development in Lactobacillus casei. Furthermore, wild type phages and cro-frameshifting negative mutants present the same phenotype, thus corroborating that only the canonical form of Cro is needed to produce a viable phage progeny.
TI  - Detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 isolated from freshwater fish: Bacteriocin from Lb. brevis FPTLB3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 AU/ml) against Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729, Lactobacillus casei MTCC 1423, Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees C for 60 min and declined thereafter. Stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at pH range of 2.0 to 8.0. Its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. Mitomycin C and UV light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. Exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except Nonidet P-40, which led to total loss of activity. No bacteriocin adsorption was detected at pH 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at pH 6.5. Based on Tricine SDS-PAGE the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kDa. No plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  - PURPOSE: Inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bacteria such as Actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. It is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. Hence, the study was undertaken to screen LABs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. METHODS: This study isolated, screened, identified and extracted Lactobacillus strains (Lb1-15) from human infant faecal samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. Lactobacillus reference strains (Ref1-7), a Gram positive control (Ctrl1) and two Gram negative controls (Ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. RESULTS: Faecal isolates were identified by DNA sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of Lactobacillus plantarum. Some strains (L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. casei and L. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). Inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium). Interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (L. plantarum) differed substantially. Some Lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and amylase). Anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a L. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (Area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). CONCLUSION: These results definitively demonstrate that Lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. Although the potential use of LAB such as Lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. Further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.
TI  - Tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter Lactobacillus strains from ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component analysis.
AB  - Non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. Here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of NSLAB previously isolated from long ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses (22 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 Lactobacillus paracasei, 3 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus harbinensis, and 2 Lactobacillus fermentum). Most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. The strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. No isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and BSH activity are unpaired traits. Finally, NSLAB strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. A multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one L. casei and two L. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.
TI  - [Influence of Lactobacillus casei on biofilm formation by enteroaggregative Escherichia coli strains isolated from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many pathogenic bacterial species have the ability to biofilm formation. In our study we determined the influence of Lactobacillus casei on biofilm formation by enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) strains obtained from irritable bowel syndrome patients. METHODS: The ability of EAEC isolates to biofilm formation was assessed in the presence of various concentrations of the probiotic L. casei strain in an a semi- quantitative microtitre plate assays under culture conditions, similar to those prevailing in the human intestine. RESULTS: Depending on the concentrations L. casei inhibited biofilm formation of the majority (> 80%) of the EAEC strains. Concentration of 4.5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of L. casei was the most effective inhibitory dose, although a few strains (approximately 18%) formed the biofilm regardless of the presence and concentration of the probiotic L. casei strain. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of L. casei on biofilm formation at most of studied EAEC strains suggest that L. casei may reduce the risk of developing persistent intestinal infections in humans.
TI  - Advanced application of bovine intestinal epithelial cell line for evaluating regulatory effect of lactobacilli against heat-killed enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-mediated inflammation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, a bovine intestinal epithelial cell line (BIE cells) was  successfully established. This work hypothesized that BIE cells are useful in vitro model system for the study of interactions of microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs) with bovine intestinal epithelial cells and for the selection of immunoregulatory lactic acid bacteria (LAB). RESULTS: All toll-like receptor (TLR) genes were expressed in BIE cells, being TLR4 one of the most strongly expressed. We demonstrated that heat-stable PAMPs of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) significantly enhanced the production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1alpha and MCP-1 in BIE cells by activating both NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. We evaluated the capacity of several lactobacilli strains to modulate heat-stable ETEC PAMPs-mediated inflammatory response in BIE cells. Among these strains evaluated, Lactobacillus casei OLL2768 attenuated heat-stable ETEC PAMPs-induced pro-inflammatory response by inhibiting NF-kappaB and p38 signaling pathways in BIE cells. Moreover, L. casei OLL2768 negatively regulated TLR4 signaling in BIE cells by up-regulating Toll interacting protein (Tollip) and B-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein (Bcl-3). CONCLUSIONS: BIE cells are suitable for the selection of immunoregulatory LAB and for studying the mechanisms involved in the protective activity of immunobiotics against pathogen-induced inflammatory damage. In addition, we showed that L. casei OLL2768 functionally modulate the bovine intestinal epithelium by attenuating heat-stable ETEC PAMPs-induced inflammation. Therefore L. casei OLL2768 is a good candidate for in vivo studying the protective effect of LAB against intestinal inflammatory damage induced by ETEC infection or heat-stable ETEC PAMPs challenge in the bovine host.
TI  - Characterization of a regulatory network of peptide antibiotic detoxification modules in Lactobacillus casei BL23.
AB  - Two-component systems (TCS) are major signal transduction pathways that allow bacteria to detect and respond to environmental and intracellular changes. A group of TCS has been shown to be involved in the response against antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These TCS are characterized by the possession of intramembrane-sensing histidine kinases, and they are usually associated with ABC transporters of the peptide-7 exporter family (Pep7E). Lactobacillus casei BL23 encodes two TCS belonging to this group (TCS09 and TCS12) that are located next to two ABC transporters (ABC09 and ABC12), as well as a third Pep7E ABC transporter not genetically associated with any TCS (orphan ABC). This study addressed the involvement of modules TCS09/ABC09 and TCS12/ABC12 in AMP resistance. Results showed that both systems contribute to L. casei resistance to AMPs, and that each TCS constitutes a functional unit with its corresponding ABC transporter. Analysis of transcriptional levels showed that module 09 is required for the induction of ABC09 expression in response to nisin. In contrast, module 12 controls a wider regulon that encompasses the orphan ABC, the dlt operon (d-alanylation of teichoid acids), and the mprF gene (l-lysinylation of phospholipids), thereby controlling properties of the cell envelope. Furthermore, the characterization of a dltA mutant showed that Dlt plays a major role in AMP resistance in L. casei. This is the first report on the regulation of the response of L. casei to AMPs, giving insight into its ability to adapt to the challenging environments that it encounters as a probiotic microorganism.
TI  - Bacteriocin PJ4 active against enteric pathogen produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (Rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  - The increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by numerous bacteria. Much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. Lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. In this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin PJ4) produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. It was effective against wide assay of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide pH range of 2-10. It has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin PJ4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kDa protein with bacteriocin activity. The peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. It showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains E. coli MTCC443, Lactobacillus casei MTCC1423, and E. faecalis DT48. Such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria from fermented olives by in vitro tests.
AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. Seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 Ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 Lactobacillus plantarum, 37 Lb. pentosus, 1 Lb. paraplantarum, and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. Lb. rhamnosus GG and Lb. casei Shirota were used as reference strains. The in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157:H7), Caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. Three (3) Lb. pentosus, 4 Lb. plantarum and 2 Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low pH. The majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 Lb. plantarum and 7 Lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. None of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. Variable efficiency to adhere to Caco-2 cells was observed. This was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. None of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. As a whole, 4 strains of Lb. pentosus, 3 strains of Lb. plantarum and 2 strains of Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains Lb. casei Shirota and Lb. rhamnosus GG. These strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.
TI  - Differences in TLR9-dependent inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha system activation by genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic DNA  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live LAB dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic DNA level. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species-Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri-using Caco-2 cells. To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation were examined. All LAB genomic DNAs dose-dependently decreased H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation. Comparison of these effects between Lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of L. acidophilus genomic DNA are lower than those of the other species. Furthermore, suppression of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a specific receptor of bacterial DNA, expression by RNAi abolished the decrease of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation by LAB genomic DNA. Our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic DNA differ between Lactobacillus species and TLR9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LAB genomic DNA.
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial effect of three irrigant solutions (chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidinated MUMS).
AB  - AIM: To compare the antimicrobial effect of 2% chlorhexidine, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and MUMS containing 2% chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All of the above irrigants were examined on Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei and E. coli. A total of 0.5 CC of each solution and 0.5 CC of McFarland solution bacterium were added to each examination tube. After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, colony count was performed for each tube. The difference in the number of bacteria indicated the effect taken by disinfectant material. RESULTS: MUMS containing chlorhexidine showed the antimicrobial properties just like chlorhexidine's effect against E. coli, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei in preventing these entire microorganisms to incubate. Sodium hypochlorite was not effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans incubated in 15, 30 and 45 minutes and Enterococcus faecalis in 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: MUMS has antimicrobial properties similar to chlorhexidine. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: As MUMS containing chlorhexidine can transfer chlorhexidine through its own surfactant around apical area and it can open the dentinal tubules by its own chelator for more penetration of chlorhexidine, it may be a choice for canal irrigation.
TI  - Construction of recombinant lactobacilli expressing the core neutralizing epitope (COE) of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and a fusion protein consisting of COE and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B, and comparison of the immune responses by orogastric immunization.
AB  - The core neutralizing epitope (COE) region of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) plays an important role in the development of the subunit vaccine against PEDV infection. To enhance the vaccine's immunogenicity, Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) has usually been adopted as a molecular adjuvant. In this study, the COE and LTB-COE genes were engineered into the Lactobacillus -Escherichia coli shuttle vectors pSAPG1 (surface-displaying) and pSAPG2 (secreting) followed by electrotransformation into Lactobacillus casei (Lc) to yield the following recombinant strains: Lc:PG1-LTB-COE, Lc:PG2-LTB-COE, Lc:PG1-COE, and Lc:PG2-COE. Our results showed that mice immunized orogastrically with L. casei expressing COE or LTB-COE produced secretory immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G with the ability to neutralize PEDV in sera and mucus. Moreover, higher levels of interleukin-4 and gamma interferon were also exhibited compared with negative control. These data displayed the tendency of Lc:PG2-LTB-COE > Lc:PG1-LTB-COE > Lc:PG2-COE > Lc:PG1-COE at the same time point. Taken together, LTB-COE is more suitable for Lactobacillus expressing system to engineer mucosal vaccine against PEDV infection.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Exploring the energy landscapes of flexible molecular loops using higher-dimensional continuation.
AB  - The conformational space of a flexible molecular loop includes the set of conformations fulfilling the geometric loop-closure constraints and its energy landscape can be seen as a scalar field defined on this implicit set. Higher-dimensional continuation tools, recently developed in dynamical systems and also applied to robotics, provide efficient algorithms to trace out implicitly defined sets. This article describes these tools and applies them to obtain full descriptions of the energy landscapes of short molecular loops that, otherwise, can only be partially explored, mainly via sampling. Moreover, to deal with larger loops, this article exploits the higher-dimensional continuation tools to find local minima and minimum energy transition paths between them, without deviating from the loop-closure constraints. The proposed techniques are applied to previously studied molecules revealing the intricate structure of their energy landscapes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Characterization of putative class II bacteriocins identified from a non-bacteriocin-producing strain Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334.
AB  - Several putative class II bacteriocin-like genes were identified in Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334, all of which might encode peptides with a double-glycine leader. Six peptides encoded by these genes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and then partially purified in order to test their bacteriocin activity. The results revealed that the mature LSEI_2163 peptide was a class IId bacteriocin that exhibited antimicrobial activity against some lactobacilli and several Listeria species. Similarly, mature LSEI_2386 was a putative pheromone peptide that also had significant bacteriocin activity against several Listeria species. The activities of both peptides tolerated 121 degrees C for 30 min but not treatment with proteinase K or trypsin. The two Cys residues located at positions 4 and 24 in the mature LSEI_2163 peptide were shown by mass spectrometry to form a disulfide bridge, which was required for optimal antibacterial activity. However, replacement of one or both Cys with Ser would cause significant reduction of the antibacterial activity, the reduction being greater when only one of the Cys residues (C4S) was replaced than when both (C4S/C24S) were replaced.
TI  - Development of an efficient in vivo system (Pjunc-TpaseIS1223) for random transposon mutagenesis of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The random transposon mutagenesis system P(junc)-TpaseIS(1223) is composed of plasmids pVI129, expressing IS1223 transposase, and pVI110, a suicide transposon plasmid carrying the P(junc) sequence, the substrate of the IS1223 transposase. This system is particularly efficient in Lactobacillus casei, as more than 10,000 stable, random mutants were routinely obtained via electroporation.
TI  - Biochemical characterization and substrate profiling of a new NADH-dependent enoate reductase from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Carbon-carbon double bond of alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds can be reduced by enoate reductase (ER), which is an important reaction in fine chemical synthesis. A putative enoate reductase gene from Lactobacillus casei str. Zhang was cloned into pET-21a+ and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) host cells. The encoded enzyme (LacER) was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and treatment in an acidic buffer. This enzyme was identified as a NADH-dependent enoate reductase, which had a K(m) of 0.034 +/- 0.006 mM and k(cat) of (3.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(3) s(-)(1) toward NADH using 2-cyclohexen-1-one as the substrate. Its K(m) and k(cat) toward substrate 2-cyclohexen-1-one were 1.94 +/- 0.04 mM and (8.4 +/- 0.2) x 10(3) s(-)(1), respectively. The enzyme showed a maximum activity at pH 8.0-9.0. The optimum temperature of the enzyme was 50-55 degrees C, and LacER was relatively stable below 60 degrees C. The enzyme was active toward aliphatic alkenyl aldehyde, ketones and some cyclic anhydrides. Substituted groups of cyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones and its ring size have positive or negative effects on activity. (R)-(-)-Carvone was reduced to (2R,5R)-dihydrocarvone with 99% conversion and 98% (diasteromeric excess: de) stereoselectivity, indicating a high synthetic potential of LacER in asymmetric synthesis.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus  casei strain Shirota (FMLC) against common multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Time-kill methods of FMLC and cell-free filtered fluid of FMLC (CF-FMLC) against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli & Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were conducted. The control solutions were Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) and distilled water. The mixtures of FMLC, CF-FMLC, MHB and DW with 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees C. Each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. The inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees C for 24-48 hr. Bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. RESULTS: Log CFUs of each organism in MHB and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11 at 24 hr. Log CFUs of each organism in FMLC and CF-FMLC after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. CONCLUSION: FMLC and CF-FMLC exerted slow inhibitory activity against MDR bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. Such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota. Clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of FMLC can prevent and treat colonization and infection with MDR bacteria in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - Fructooligosaccharides metabolism and effect on bacteriocin production in Lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses.
AB  - Fructo- (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides have been used to promote the growth of probiotics, mainly those from Lactobacillus genus. However, only few reports have evaluated the effect of prebiotics on bacteriocins activity and production. In this work, we characterized the effect of FOS supplementation on the growth, lactic and acetic acids production, and antimicrobial activity of crude extracts obtained from Lactobacillus strains isolated from ensiled corn and molasses. Seven out of 28 isolated Lactobacillus, belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus brevis, showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria innocua. Among them, the strain L. plantarum LE5 showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Enteroccocus faecalis; while the L. plantarum LE27 strain showed antimicrobial effect against L. monocytogenes, E. faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. This antimicrobial activity in most of the cases was obtained only after FOS supplementation. In summary, these results show the feasibility to increase the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus bacteriocins by supplementing the growth medium with FOS.
TI  - The major secreted protein Msp1/p75 is O-glycosylated in Lactobacillus rhamnosus  GG.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the occurrence, biosynthesis and possible functions of glycoproteins are increasingly documented for pathogens, glycoproteins are not yet widely described in probiotic bacteria. Nevertheless, knowledge of protein glycosylation holds important potential for better understanding specific glycan-mediated interactions of probiotics and for glycoengineering in food-grade microbes. RESULTS: Here, we provide evidence that the major secreted protein Msp1/p75 of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is glycosylated. Msp1 was shown to stain positive with periodic-acid Schiff staining, to be susceptible to chemical deglycosylation, and to bind with the mannose-specific Concanavalin A (ConA) lectin. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli resulted in a significant reduction in molecular mass, loss of ConA reactivity and increased sensitivity towards pronase E and proteinase K. Mass spectrometry showed that Msp1 is O-glycosylated and identified a glycopeptide TVETPSSA (amino acids 101-108) bearing hexoses presumably linked to the serine residues. Interestingly, these serine residues are not present in the homologous protein of several Lactobacillus casei strains tested, which also did not bind to ConA. The role of the glycan substitutions in known functions of Msp1 was also investigated. Glycosylation did not seem to impact significantly on the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of Msp1. In addition, the glycan chain appeared not to be required for the activation of Akt signaling in intestinal epithelial cells by Msp1. On the other hand, examination of different cell extracts showed that Msp1 is a glycosylated protein in the supernatant, but not in the cell wall and cytosol fraction, suggesting a link between glycosylation and secretion of this protein. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we have provided the first evidence of protein O-glycosylation in the probiotic L rhamnosus GG. The major secreted protein Msp1 is glycosylated with ConA reactive sugars at the serine residues at 106 and 107. Glycosylation is not required for the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of Msp1 nor for Akt activation capacity in epithelial cells, but appears to be important for its stability and protection against proteases.
TI  - Antimicrobial prenylated acetophenones from berries of Harrisonia abyssinica.
AB  - The ripe berries of Harrisonia abyssinica yielded two new prenylated acetophenones, namely 5-(ethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (1) and 5-(2'''-hydroxyethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (2), herein named harronin I and harronin II, respectively. The compounds were isolated following activity guided fractionation and the structures were determined using 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic, CD and MS spectrometric techniques. The methanol-dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1 v/v) crude extract exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei. Harronin I (1) showed a MIC of 5 microg/mL against C. albicans, 6 microg/mL against B. cereus, and more than 20 microg/mL against other tested microorganisms. Harronin II (2) showed much weaker MIC values (> 100 microg/mL) against all the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Expression of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) VP2-VP3 fusion protein  in Lactobacillus casei and immunogenicity in rainbow trouts.
AB  - Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) infects wild and cultured salmonids,  causing high mortality in juvenile trouts and salmons. IPNV VP2-VP3 fusion gene was constructed by splicing overlap extension (SOE) PCR and inserted into Lactobacillus/Escherichia coli shuttle vectors (pPG1and pPG2) followed by transformation of Lactobacillus casei competent cell to yield two recombinant strains: Lc:PG1-VP2-VP3 (surface-displayed) and Lc:PG2-VP2-VP3 (secretory). Subsequently, juvenile rainbow trouts were inoculated with the recombinant strains via orogastric route. Our results demonstrated that Lactobacillus-derived VP2-VP3 fusion protein could induce production of serum IgM specific for IPNV with neutralizing activity in rainbow trouts. Statistical analyses of IgM levels showed that immunogenicity of Lc:PG1-VP2-VP3 was more powerful than that of Lc:PG2-VP2-VP3 (P<0.001) in rainbow trouts. This result has been confirmed by viral loads reduction analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in orogastrically immunized rainbow trouts after virus challenging. Comparing to trouts received Lactobacillus (control), rainbow trouts orogastrically dosed with Lc:PG1-VP2-VP3 resulted in approximately 10-fold reduction in viral loads on day 10 post-virus challenging, and approximately 4-fold did by Lc:PG2-VP2-VP3. Taken together, Lc:PG1-VP2-VP3 functions as novel mucosal vaccine against IPNV infection in rainbow trouts, which most likely come true.
TI  - Probiotic features of two oral Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - In this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. Samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (G1) and L. casei (G3). Both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, and Clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of Candida albicans. The bacteriocin activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6358-P was shown only by L. plantarum G1. Moreover, the isolates G1 and G3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. The viability of G1 and G3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. The biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated Wistar rats, compared to control ones. No toxicity for NMRI Ham mice was observed. According to our experimental results, these findings imply that L. plantarum G1 and L. casei G3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.
TI  - Synthesis, SAR and antibacterial activity of hybrid chloro, dichloro-phenylthiazolyl-s-triazines.
AB  - A series of hybrid novel chloro (1a-9a) and dichloro (10b-18b) phenylthiazolyl-s-triazine were synthesized and subsequently subjected to their antibacterial activity against three gram positive viz. Lactobacillus casei (NCIM-2651); Bacillus cereus (NCIM-2458); Staphylococcus aureus (NCIM-2120) and three gram negative viz Salmonella typhimurium (NCIM-2501); Escherichia coli (NCIM-2065); Klebsiella aerogenes (NCIM-2098). The SAR studies around the lead compound revealed that introduction of electron withdrawing groups and amino (-NH-) and mercapto (-S-) linker bridge seemed more promising towards antibacterial activity. Moreover, the virtual Molinspiration screenings are in compliance with Ghose's rule.
TI  - Properties of the inulinase gene levH1 of Lactobacillus casei IAM 1045; cloning,  mutational and biochemical characterization.
AB  - Though some genetic features of lactobacillar fructan hydrolases were elucidated, information about their enzymology or mutational analyses were scarce. Lactobacillus casei IAM1045 exhibits extracellular activity degrading inulin. After partial purification of the inulin-degrading protein from the spent culture medium, several fragments were obtained by protease digestion. Based on their partial amino-acid sequences, oligonucleotide primers were designed, and its structural gene (levH1) was determined using the gene library constructed in the E. coli system. The levH1 gene encoded a protein (designated as LevH1), of which calculated molecular mass and pI were 138.8-kDa and 4.66, respectively. LevH1 (1296 amino-acids long) was predicted to have a four-domain structure, containing (i) an N-terminal secretion signal of 40 amino-acids, (ii) variable domain of about 140 residues whose function is unclear, (iii) a catalytic domain of about 630 residues with glycoside-hydrolase activity consisting of two modules, a five-blade beta-propeller module linked to a beta-sandwich module, (iv) a C-terminal domain of about 490 residues comprising five nearly perfect repeat sequences of 80 residues homologous to equivalents of other hypothetical cell surface proteins, followed by 37-residues rich in Ser/Thr/Pro/Gly, a pentad LPQAG (the LPXTG homologue). When overproduced in E. coli, the putative variable-catalytic domain region of about 770 residues exhibited exo-inulinase activity. Deletion analyses demonstrated that the variable-catalytic domain region containing two modules is important for enzymatic activity. Presence of eight conserved motifs (I-VIII) was suggested in the catalytic domain by comparative analysis, among which motif VIII was newly identified in the beta-sandwich module in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino-acids in these motifs revealed that D198, R388, D389 and E440, were crucial for inulinase activity. Moreover, mutations of D502A and D683A in motif VI and VIII respectively caused significant decrease in the activity. These results suggested that the variable domain and beta-sandwich module, besides the beta-propeller module, are important for inulin-degrading activity of LevH1.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Immunogenicity of Lactobacillus-expressing VP2 and VP3 of the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in rainbow trout.
AB  - Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) infects salmonid fish with high mortality and causes serious economic losses to salmonid aquaculture. Lactobacillus strains have a number of properties that make them attractive candidates as delivery vehicles for the presentation to the mucosa of compounds with pharmaceutical interest, in particular vaccines. Here, Lactobacilli/Escherichia coli shuttle vector pPG1 (surface-displayed) or pPG2 (secretory) with the capsid VP2 gene inserted was transformed into Lactobacillus casei to yield two recombinant strains: Lc:PG1-VP2 and Lc:PG2-VP2, respectively. Rainbow trout immunized respectively with Lc:PG1-VP2, Lc:PG2-VP2, Lc:PG1-VP3 and Lc:PG2-VP3 elicited anti-IPNV immune responses (serum IgM) via oral route. Statistical results of serum IgM titer with neutralizing activity showed that immunogenicity of Lc:PG2-VP2 was more powerful than that of Lc:PG1-VP2 (P < 0.001), Lc:PG1-VP3 (P < 0.001) and Lc:PG2-VP3 (P < 0.001), which was confirmed by viral loads reduction analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in orally immunized rainbow trout after virus challenge. Comparing with negative control, rainbow trout orally dosed with Lc:PG2-VP2 resulted in approximately 46-fold reduction in virus load on days 10 post viral challenge as well as Lc:PG1-VP2( approximately 20-fold), Lc:PG2-VP3( approximately 6-fold) and Lc:PG1-VP3( approximately 3-fold). Taken together, Lc:PG2-VP2 exhibited a more appropriate candidate as live bacteria vaccine against IPNV infection in rainbow trout.
TI  - CysK from Lactobacillus casei encodes a protein with O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase and cysteine desulfurization activity.
AB  - A gene encoding an O-acetyl-L-serine sulfhydrylase (cysK) was cloned from Lactobacillus casei FAM18110 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme synthesized cysteine from sulfide and O-acetyl-L-serine at pH 5.5 and pH 7.4. At pH 7.4, the apparent K(M) for O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and sulfide were 0.6 and 6.7 mM, respectively. Furthermore, the enzyme showed cysteine desulfurization activity in the presence of dithiothreitol at pH 7.5, but not at pH 5.5. The apparent K(M) for L-cysteine was 0.7 mM. The synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine or OAS was not observed. When expressed in a cysMK mutant of Escherichia coli, the cloned gene complemented the cysteine auxotrophy of the mutant. These findings suggested that the gene product is mainly involved in cysteine biosynthesis in L. casei. Quantitative real-time PCR and a mass spectrometric assay based on selected reaction monitoring demonstrated that L. casei FAM18110 is constitutively overexpressing cysK.
TI  - Community-based interference against integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  - As part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. Unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Less emphasis has been given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. When co-cultivated in saliva medium, P. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. Furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. More interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent P. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. Our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as P. aeruginosa.
TI  - LysA2, the Lactobacillus casei bacteriophage A2 lysin is an endopeptidase active  on a wide spectrum of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The lysin gene (lysA2) of the Lactobacillus casei bacteriophage A2 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. LysA2 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the terminal D: -alanine of the peptidoglycan tetrapeptide and the aspartic acid residue that forms the bridge with the L: -lysine of a neighboring peptidoglycan chain, characteristic of Gram-positive bacteria included into the A4 peptidoglycan subgroup. This includes most lactobacilli, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Pediococcus pentosaceus, the walls of all of which were substrates for the enzyme. Specific binding of LysA2 to the wall of these bacteria is mediated by its C-terminal moiety, does not need the N-terminal catalytic domain for recognition, and is stable: at least 88% of the molecules were still bound to L. casei after 3 days in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees C. The enzyme acts as a monomer, is active at pH values between 4 and 6, and at temperatures ranging between 18 degrees C and 50 degrees C while being independent of divalent cation addition. The enzyme showed strong resistance to incubation at high and low pH values but became progressively inactivated at 50 degrees C and above. LysA2 is bactericidal, the viability of L. casei cultures dropping to 1% in 10 min, under the standard conditions used for the enzymatic assay.
TI  - Immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing a beta-intimin fragment  reduces intestinal colonization by Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries. Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces. Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of beta-intimin (L. casei-Int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) IgA in feces but no IgG in sera. Conversely, anti-Int(cv) IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int(cv). All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces. However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv) by the sublingual route. These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv.) The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.
TI  - Immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus casei strains producing K99, K88 fimbrial protein protects mice against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - To exploit a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention against K99 or K88 infections of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), we have developed a mucosal delivery vehicle based on Lactobacillus casei CICC 6105 using poly-gamma-glutamate synthetase A (PgsA) as an anchoring matrix. To evaluate the immunization effect of the recombinant strains (harboring plasmids pLA-K99-K88-LTB, pLA-K99, and pLA-K88), anti-ETEC K99 or K88 antibody responses, T-cell proliferation, and cytokines by intracellular staining (ICS) were investigated after specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice orally inoculated with these recombinant strains. After oral vaccination into C57BL/6 mice, all recombinant strains were proved to be immunogenic and able to elicit high levels of mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, intestinal fluids and prominent systemic immunoglobulin G and IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2a) responses in sera. Using the T-cell proliferation assay, the stimulation index (SI) of groups immunized with pLA-K99/L. casei and pLA-K88/L. casei reached to 2.73 and 2.64, respectively, versus 2.56 in a group immunized with pLA-K99-K88-LTB/L. casei. A detailed analysis of the cell-mediated immune responses by ICS showed the number of specific CD8(+) T cells expressing cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2) and granule-associated proteins (CD107a) was higher than that of specific CD4(+) T cells secreted by immune spleen cells upon restimulation in vitro with peptides. Next, the results showed that DCs activated in vitro with recombinant L. casei enhance specific T-cell proliferation and promote T cells to produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. More than 80% of the vaccinated mice were protected after challenge with a lethal dose of standard strains C83912 and C83902. These results demonstrate that recombinant L. casei can induce specific humoral and mucosal antibodies and cellular immune response against protective antigens upon oral administration.
TI  - Sequencing and analysis of three plasmids from Lactobacillus casei TISTR1341 and  development of plasmid-derived Escherichia coli-L. casei shuttle vectors.
AB  - Pyrosequencing followed by conventional PCR and sequencing was used to determine  the complete nucleotide sequence of three plasmids (pRCEID2.9, pRCEID3.2, and pRCEID13.9) from the Lactobacillus casei strain TISTR1341. The plasmid sequences were found to be almost identical, respectively, to those of pLA106, pLA105, and pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus strain TK8912, suggesting that these strains may be related. Sequence analysis and comparison indicated that pRCEID2.9 replicates by a rolling circle (RC) mechanism, while pRCEID3.2 and pRCEID13.9 probably follow a theta-type mode of replication. Replicons of pRCEID2.9 and pRCEID13.9 were used to develop Escherichia coli/L. casei compatible shuttle vectors, which were stably maintained in different genetic backgrounds. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed copy numbers of around 4 and 15, respectively, for the pRCEID13.9- and pRCEID2.9-derived shuttle vectors per chromosome equivalent. The functionality of vector pRCEID-LC13.9 was proved by cloning and expressing in L. casei of a green fluorescent protein gene variant from Aequorea victoria under the control of the promoter from a homologous lactate dehydrogenase gene. The new vectors might complement those currently in use for the exploitation of L. casei as a cellular factory and in other biotechnological applications.
TI  - Effect of cellooligosaccharide or synbiotic feeding on growth performance, fecal  condition and hormone concentrations in Holstein calves.
AB  - We investigated the effect of cellooligosaccharide (CE) or a combination of dextran and Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei strain JCM1134(T) (synbiotic; SB) feeding on growth performance, fecal condition and hormone concentrations in Holstein calves. Fifty-two female Holstein calves were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: CE feeding group (n = 16), SB feeding group (n = 18), and control group (n = 18). Body weight at 90 days of age, as well as daily body weight gain (DG) and feed efficiency after weaning to 90 days of age were greater (P < 0.05) in the CE feeding group than in the control group. The total fecal score tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in the SB feeding group than in the control group. Plasma insulin concentration was higher (P < 0.05) in the CE feeding group than in the control group at 90 days of age. Our results indicate that CE feeding improved DG and feed efficiency in calves. On the other hand, there was less effect on growth performance and fecal Escherichia coli counts in calves fed SB.
TI  - Incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
AB  - For dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. Contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. Hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (Listeria innocua, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). Three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/g. Inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. The inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. In specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by B. animalis against P. aeruginosa and by L. casei against Salmonella Enteritidis and L. innocua. Conversely, the least inhibition was detected for L. casei against P. aeruginosa. Our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.
TI  - Identification of the binding modes of N-phenylphthalimides inhibiting bacterial  thymidylate synthase through X-ray crystallography screening.
AB  - To identify specific bacterial thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors, we exploited phenolphthalein (PTH), which inhibits both bacterial and human enzymes. The X-ray crystal structure of Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) that binds PTH showed multiple binding modes of the inhibitor, which prevented a classical structure-based drug design approach. To overcome this issue, we synthesized two phthalimidic libraries that were tested against TS enzymes and then we performed X-ray crystallographic screening of the active compounds. Compounds 6A, 8A, and 12A showed 40-fold higher affinity for bacterial TS than human TS. The X-ray crystallographic screening characterized the binding mode of six inhibitors in complexes with LcTS. Of these, 20A, 23A, and 24A showed a common unique binding mode, whereas 8A showed a different, unique binding mode. A comparative analysis of the LcTS X-ray complexes that were obtained with the pathogenic TS enabled the selection of compounds 8A and 23A as specific compounds and starting points to be exploited for the specific inhibition of pathogen enzymes.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity against Shigella sonnei and probiotic properties of wild lactobacilli from fermented food.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus paracasei subp. paracasei M5-L, Lactobacillus rhamnosus J10-L, Lactobacillus casei Q8-L and L. rhamnosus GG (LGG), were systematically assessed for the production of antimicrobial substances active towards Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Agar-well assay showed that the four lactobacilli strains displayed strong antibacterial activity towards S. sonnei. The nature of antimicrobial substances was also investigated and shown to be dependent on the production of organic acids, in particular the lactic acid. Time-kill assay showed that the viability of the S. sonnei was decreased by 2.7-3.6logCFU/ml after contact with CFCS (cell-free culture supernatants) of four lactobacilli for 2h, which confirmed the result of the agar-well assay. Further analysis of the organic acid composition in the CFCS revealed that the content of lactic acid range from 227 to 293mM. In addition, the aggregations properties, adherence properties and tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions were also investigated in vitro tests. The result suggested that the M5-L, J10-L and Q8-L strains possess desirable antimicrobial activity towards S. sonnei and probiotic properties as LGG and could be potentially used as novel probiotic strains in the food industry.
TI  - NMR structures of apo L. casei dihydrofolate reductase and its complexes with trimethoprim and NADPH: contributions to positive cooperative binding from ligand-induced refolding, conformational changes, and interligand hydrophobic interactions.
AB  - In order to examine the origins of the large positive cooperativity (DeltaG(0)(coop) = -2.9 kcal mol(-1)) of trimethoprim (TMP) binding to a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in the presence of NADPH, we have determined and compared NMR solution structures of L. casei apo DHFR and its binary and ternary complexes with TMP and NADPH and made complementary thermodynamic measurements. The DHFR structures are generally very similar except for the A-B loop region and part of helix B (residues 15-31) which could not be directly detected for L. casei apo DHFR because of line broadening from exchange between folded and unfolded forms. Thermodynamic and NMR measurements suggested that a significant contribution to the cooperativity comes from refolding of apo DHFR on binding the first ligand (up to -0.95 kcals mol(-1) if 80% of A-B loop requires refolding). Comparisons of Calpha-Calpha distance differences and domain rotation angles between apo DHFR and its complexes indicated that generally similar conformational changes involving domain movements accompany formation of the binary complexes with either TMP or NADPH and that the binary structures are approaching that of the ternary complex as would be expected for positive cooperativity. These favorable ligand-induced structural changes upon binding the first ligand will also contribute significantly to the cooperative binding. A further substantial contribution to cooperative binding results from the proximity of the bound ligands in the ternary complex: this reduces the solvent accessible area of the ligand and provides a favorable entropic hydrophobic contribution (up to -1.4 kcal mol(-1)).
TI  - Drosophila immunity: analysis of PGRP-SB1 expression, enzymatic activity and function.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is an essential and specific component of the bacterial cell wall and therefore is an ideal recognition signature for the immune system. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are conserved from insects to mammals and able to bind PGN (non-catalytic PGRPs) and, in some cases, to efficiently degrade it (catalytic PGRPs). In Drosophila, several non-catalytic PGRPs function as selective peptidoglycan receptors upstream of the Toll and Imd pathways, the two major signalling cascades regulating the systemic production of antimicrobial peptides. Recognition PGRPs specifically activate the Toll pathway in response to Lys-type peptidoglycan found in most Gram-positive bacteria and the Imd pathway in response to DAP-type peptidoglycan encountered in Gram-positive bacilli-type bacteria and in Gram-negative bacteria. Catalytic PGRPs on the other hand can potentially reduce the level of immune activation by scavenging peptidoglycan. In accordance with this, PGRP-LB and PGRP-SC1A/B/2 have been shown to act as negative regulators of the Imd pathway. In this study, we report a biochemical and genetic analysis of PGRP-SB1, a catalytic PGRP. Our data show that PGRP-SB1 is abundantly secreted into the hemolymph following Imd pathway activation in the fat body, and exhibits an enzymatic activity towards DAP-type polymeric peptidoglycan. We have generated a PGRP-SB1/2 null mutant by homologous recombination, but its thorough phenotypic analysis did not reveal any immune function, suggesting a subtle role or redundancy of PGRP-SB1/2 with other molecules. Possible immune functions of PGRP-SB1 are discussed.
TI  - Inactivation of Escherichia coli in broth and sausage by combined high pressure and Lactobacillus casei cell extract.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of combined high pressure and Lactobacillus casei cell extract (CE) on Escherichia coli O157 strains with variation in pressure resistance in broth and sausage. Pressure-resistant (O157:H7 and O157:H12) and -sensitive (O157-M1 and O157-M2) E. coli strains were used. Pressure treatment at 350 MPa for 20 min in broth caused 1.1-1.2 logs reduction in O157:H12 and O157:H7 and 4.1-5.5 logs reduction in the O157-M1 and O157-M2. When high pressure was treated in the presence of CE (32 CEAU/mL), the combination treatment caused a significant inactivation in the pressure-resistant O157:H7 strains resulting in the viability loss of 4.3-4.6 logs and the synergistic effect increased with increase in treatment time (p < 0.05). Similar result was observed in sausage. Differential scanning calorimetry thermogram showed that the presence of Lb. casei CE may cause considerable damage to cellular components of E. coli during the high pressure treatment. The synergy between high pressure processing and Lb. casei OSY-LB6A CE against pressure-resistant E. coli O157 strains suggests the feasibility of using this combination to minimize the risk of transmission of E. coli O157 by food.
TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - Expression of Lactobacillus reuteri Pg4 collagen-binding protein gene in Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 increases its adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The collagen-binding protein gene cnb was cloned from the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri strain Pg4. The DNA sequence of the cnb gene (792 bp) has an open reading frame encoding 263 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 28.5 kDa. The cnb gene was constructed so as to constitutively express under the control of the Lactococcus lactis lacA promoter and was transformed into Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, a strain isolated from dairy products with poor ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of the transformed strain Lb. casei pNZ-cnb indicated that Cnb was displayed on its cell surface. Lb. casei pNZ-cnb not only showed a higher ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells but also exhibited a higher competition ability against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes adhesion to Caco-2 cells than Lb. casei ATCC 393.
TI  - The influence of some probiotic supernatants on the growth and virulence features expression of several selected enteroaggregative E. coli clinical strains.
AB  - The purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of three probiotic  supernatants (Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700, Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei ATCC 393) on the growth (quantified by viable cell counts) and virulence features expression (adherence ability to HEp-2 cells and inert substratum- slime test) of several selected EAggEC diarrhoeagenic strains as well as the cytotoxicity of the respective supernatants on HEp-2 cells. RESULTS: Our in vitro studies are demonstrating that the selected supernatants, when added simultaneously with the bacterial culture are generally opposing to the adherence to the cellular substratum by the EAggEC strains. When added after the pre-adherence period, the supernatants did not change the adherence indexes of the EAggEC strains, but induced slight changes in the adherence pattern, reducing the frequency and size of bacterial aggregates. Only in few cases, the bacterial growth rate was slightly increased or sustained by the probiotic supernatants, a possible explanation being that we used supernatants obtained from 24 hrs fresh cultures, which are probably still containing some nutrients and probably also other growth factors. CONCLUSION: Our results are demonstrating that soluble probiotic metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants may interfere with the first step of adherence and colonization of the cellular and inert substrata by EAggEC strains, probablyby the cross-talk between probiotic soluble molecules and quorum-sensing mediators of opportunistic strains; so, direct contact between the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria are not always necessary for the occurrence of a protective effect, that could be partly mediated by the soluble molecules secreted by specific probiotic strains.
TI  - Predicting gene-regulation functions: lessons from temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - Gene-regulation functions (GRF) provide a unique characteristic of a cis-regulatory module (CRM), relating the concentrations of transcription factors (input) to the promoter activities (output). The challenge is to predict GRFs from the sequence. Here we systematically consider the lysogeny-lysis CRMs of different temperate bacteriophages such as the Lactobacillus casei phage A2, Escherichia coli phages lambda, and 186 and Lactococcal phage TP901-1. This study allowed explaining a recent experimental puzzle on the role of Cro protein in the lambda switch. Several general conclusions have been drawn: 1), long-range interactions, multilayer assembly and DNA looping may lead to complex GRFs that cannot be described by linear functions of binding site occupancies; 2), in general, GRFs cannot be described by the Boolean logic, whereas a three-state non-Boolean logic suffices for the studied examples; 3), studied CRMs of the intact phages seemed to have a similar GRF topology (the number of plateaus and peaks corresponding to different expression regimes); we hypothesize that functionally equivalent CRMs might have topologically equivalent GRFs for a larger class of genetic systems; and 4) within a given GRF class, a set of mechanistic-to-mathematical transformations has been identified, which allows shaping the GRF before carrying out a system-level analysis.
TI  - Comparison of the immune responses induced by oral immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei-expressing porcine parvovirus VP2 and VP2 fused to Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit protein.
AB  - The major structural protein VP2 of porcine parvovirus (PPV) was used as the model parvovirus antigen, which has been expressed in Lactobacillus casei fusing with Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) as mucosal adjuvant. The VP2-LTB DNA fragment was cloned into vector pPG611 or pPG612 to generated inducible surface-displayed and secretion expression systems based on xylose promoter, designated as rLc:pPG611-VP2-LTB (recombinant L. casei) and rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB, respectively. Expression of the fusion protein was verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blot immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. It was observed that the level of IgG or sIgA from mice orally immunized with VP2-LTB was higher than that from mice received VP2 and negative control, which demonstrated significantly statistically different. Especially, the titer of IgG or sIgA in mice immunized with rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB is the highest in this study. In summary, LTB as mucosal adjuvant was able to effectively facilitate induction of mucosal and systemic immunity by L. casei-expressing VP2 fusion protein.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus casei expressing human lactoferrin elevates antibacterial activity in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - In this study, Lactobacillus casei was used to deliver and express human lactoferrin (hLF) to protect the host against bacterial infection. Full-length hLF cDNA was cloned into a Lactobacillus-specific plasmid to produce the L. casei transformants (rhLF/L. casei). Antimicrobial activity of recombinant hLF was examined in inhibition of bacteria growth in vitro. A mouse model was established to test in vivo antibacterial activity and protective effect of orally-administered probiotic L. casei transformant in the gastrointestinal tract. Trials were conducted in which animals were challenged with E. coli ATCC25922. E. coli colony numbers in duodenal fluid from the group fed with rhLF/L. casei were significantly lower than those of the group fed with wild-type L. casei or placebo (P < 0.01). Histopathological analyses of the small intestine, showed both decreased intestinal injury and increased villi length were observed in the mice fed with rhLF/L. casei as compared with the control groups (P < 0.01). Our results demonstrate that L. casei expressing hLF exhibited antibacterial activity both in in vitro and in vivo. It also provides a potentially large-scale production of hLF as applications for treatment of infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid pD403 from Lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid pD403 was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum D403 derived from fermented dairy products. It was 2,791 bp in size with a G+C content of 37%. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. ORF1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (RepA). ORF2 (137 amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of Ralstonia pickettii 12D. Functional investigation indicated that ORF2 (Tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. The origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pD403 was a rolling-circle-replication (RCR) plasmid. An Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vector pCD4032 was constructed based on the pD403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus brevis. The transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram DNA. Furthermore, an expression vector pCD4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. The green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pCD4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
AB  - The effects of nine probiotic strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) were examined. The culture supernatant of the E. faecium strain, with or without pH adjustment to a neutral pH, had a strong bactericidal effect on EAggEC, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. Supernatants of the L. casei ss. casei and L. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on EAggEC, but this activity was abolished by pH adjustment to a neutral pH. No inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of Bifidobacterium or E. faecalis strains was detected. Adhesion of EAggEC to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains tested. Two strains of L. casei enhanced EAggEC biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. These results suggest that the three different bacterial species; Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus, have different effects on EAggEC, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against EAggEC infection.
TI  - Systematic review of randomised controlled trials: probiotics for functional constipation.
AB  - AIM: To systematically evaluate and update evidence on the efficacy and safety of probiotic supplementation for the treatment of constipation. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched in May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in paediatric or adult populations related to the study aim. RESULTS: We included five RCTs with a total of 377 subjects (194 in the experimental group and 183 in the control group). The participants were adults (three RCTs, n = 266) and children (two RCTs, n = 111) with constipation. In adults, data suggests a favourable effect of treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 on defecation frequency and stool consistency. In children, L. casei rhamnosus Lcr35, but not L. rhamnosus GG, showed a beneficial effect. CONCLUSION: Until more data are available, we believe the use of probiotics for the treatment of constipation condition should be considered investigational.
TI  - Recombinant porcine rotavirus VP4 and VP4-LTB expressed in Lactobacillus casei induced mucosal and systemic antibody responses in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine rotavirus infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the swine industry necessitating the development of effective vaccines for the prevention of infection. Immune responses associated with protection are primarily mucosal in nature and induction of mucosal immunity is important for preventing porcine rotavirus infection. RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei expressing the major protective antigen VP4 of porcine rotavirus (pPG612.1-VP4) or VP4-LTB (heat-labile toxin B subunit from Echerichia coli) (pPG612.1-VP4-LTB) fusion protein was used to immunize mice orally. The expression of recombinant pPG612.1-VP4 and pPG612.1-VP4-LTB was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis and surface-displayed expression on L. casei was verified by immunofluorescence. Mice orally immunized with recombinant protein-expressing L. casei produced high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA. The IgA titers from mice immunized with pPG612.1-VP4-LTB were higher than titters from pPG612.1-VP4-immunized mice. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on RV infection. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that VP4 administered in the context of an L. casei expression system is an effective method for stimulating mucosal immunity and that LTB served to further stimulate mucosal immunity suggesting that this strategy can be adapted for use in pigs.
TI  - Killing of adherent oral microbes by a non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet.
AB  - Atmospheric plasma jets are being intensively studied with respect to potential applications in medicine. The aim of this in vitro study was to test a microwave-powered non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet for its antimicrobial efficacy against adherent oral micro-organisms. Agar plates and dentin slices were inoculated with 6 log(10) c.f.u. cm(-2) of Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, with Escherichia coli as a control. Areas of 1 cm(2) on the agar plates or the complete dentin slices were irradiated with a helium plasma jet for 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9 s mm(-2), respectively. The agar plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, and dentin slices were vortexed in liquid media and suspensions were placed on agar plates. The killing efficacy of the plasma jet was assessed by counting the number of c.f.u. on the irradiated areas of the agar plates, as well as by determination of the number of c.f.u. recovered from dentin slices. A microbe-killing effect was found on the irradiated parts of the agar plates for L. casei, S. mutans, C. albicans and E. coli. The plasma-jet treatment reduced the c.f.u. by 3-4 log(10) intervals on the dentin slices in comparison to recovery rates from untreated controls. The microbe-killing effect was correlated with increasing irradiation times. Thus, non-thermal atmospheric plasma jets could be used for the disinfection of dental surfaces.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activities of Sinapis alba L. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and L. casei. The active component of S. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and HPLC and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. The antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. Phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of C. difficile and C. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. Furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of E. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and E. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. In conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of immune response after oral and intranasal immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus casei expressing ETEC F41].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to represent a promising strategy for mucosal vaccination, oral or intranasal immunization of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) BALB/c mice were performed. The mucosal immunity, systemic immune and protective immune responses were compared after immunization with the recombinant Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) harboring enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F41. METHOD: The recombinant fusion proteins were detected by Western blot. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Six-week-old female SPF BALB/c mice (160 heads) were divided into 4 groups for immunization and control. Oral and intranasal immunization of mice was performed with the recombinant strain L. casei harboring pLA-F41 or pLA. For oral immunization, the mice were inoculated daily on days 0 to 4, 7 to 11, 21 to 25, and 49 to 53. A lighter schedule was used for nasal immunization (days 0 to 2, 7 to 9, 21 and 49). Specific anti-F41 IgG antibody in the serum and specific anti-F41 secret immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibody in the lung, intestines, vagina fluid and feces of mice were detected by indirect ELISA. The mice orally or intranasally immunized with pLA-F41/L. casei and pLA/IL. casei were challenged with standard-type ETEC F41 (C83919) (2 x 10(3) LD50). RESULT: Mice immunized with pLA-F41/L. casei could produce remarkable anti-F41 antibody level. More than 90% survived in oral immunization group whereas more than 85% survived in intranasal immunization group after challenged with C83919, all dead in the control group. Ninety percent of the pups survived in oral immunization group whereas 80% survived in intranasal immunization group after challenged with C83919, but only a 5% survival rate for pups that were either immunized with a control pLA vector or unimmunized. CONCLUSION: Oral or intranasal immunization with recombinant L. casei displaying ETEC F41 antigens on the surface induced effective and similar systemic and mucosal immune responses against the ETEC F41.
TI  - Immediate detection of living bacteria at ultralow concentrations using a carbon  nanotube based potentiometric aptasensor.
AB  
TI  - Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of orally or intranasally administered recombinant Lactobacillus casei expressing ETEC K99.
AB  - In an effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K99 infections, we have developed a surface antigen display system using pgsA (poly-gamma-glutamate synthetase A) as an anchoring matrix. The recombinant fusion proteins comprised of pgsA and fimbriae protein of ETEC K99 were stably expressed on Lactobacillus casei. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) BALB/c mice orally or intranasally vaccinated with recombinant L. casei resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA against ETEC K99, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using purified fimbriae peptides. The serum antibody isotypes elicited were predominantly IgG1 and IgG2a. Vaccinated SPF BALB/c mice were evaluated by oral challenge with standard-type ETEC C83912 after the last booster immunization. More than 80% of immunized mice survived regardless of the immune route. The antibody titers elicited following oral immunization were lower than those following intranasal immunization but the protective efficacy was in the same order of magnitude. These results indicate that mucosal immunization with recombinant L. casei expressing ETEC K99 fimbriae protein on its surface provides an effective means for eliciting a protective immune response against the ETEC K99.
TI  - Comparative study of Bifidobacterium animalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and Saccharomyces boulardii probiotic properties.
AB  - The present work investigates some probiotic properties of four different microorganisms (Bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis BB-12, Escherichia coli EMO, Lactobacillus casei and Saccharomyces boulardii). In vitro and in vivo tests were carried out to compare cell wall hydrophobicity, production of antagonistic substances, survival capacity in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice without pathological consequence, and immune modulation by stimulation of Kupffer cells, intestinal sIgA and IL-10 levels. In vitro antagonism against pathogenic bacteria and yeast was only observed for the probiotic bacteria B. animalis and L. casei. The hydrophobic property of the cell wall was higher for B. animalis and E. coli EMO, and this property could be responsible for a better ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice. Higher levels of sIgA were observed mainly for S. boulardii, followed by E. coli EMO and B. animalis, and only S. boulardii induced a significant higher level of IL-10. In conclusion, for a probiotic use, S. boulardii presented better characteristics in terms of immunomodulation, and B. animalis and L. casei for antagonistic substance production. The knowledge of the different probiotic properties could be used to choice the better microorganism depending on the therapeutic or prophylactic application.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Induction of immune responses in mice after oral immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus casei strains expressing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F41 fimbrial protein.
AB  - In an effort to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F41 infections, we have developed a surface antigen display system using poly-gamma-glutamate synthetase A (PgsA) as an anchoring matrix. The recombinant fusion proteins comprised of PgsA and fimbrial protein of F41 were stably expressed in Lactobacillus casei 525. Surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Oral inoculation of recombinant L. casei 525 into specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice resulted in significant mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers that remained elevated for >16 weeks. High levels of IgG responses in sera specific for F41 fimbriae were also induced, with prominent IgG1 titers as well as IgG2a and IgG2b titers. The helper T-cell (Th) response was Th2-cell dominant, as evidenced by increased mucosal and systemic interleukin-4-producing T cells and a concomitant elevation of serum IgG1 antibody responses. More than 80% of the mice were protected against challenge with a 2 x 10(4)-fold 50% lethal dose of standard-type F41 (C83919). The induced antibodies were important for eliciting a protective immune response against F41 infection. These results indicated that the use of recombinant L. casei 525 could be a valuable strategy for future vaccine development for ETEC.
TI  - [Survival properties of ETEC surface-displayed K88ac-LT(B) on Lactobacillus casei].
AB  - K88ac-LT(B) gene derived from pQE30-K88ac-LT(B) was cloned into the expression vector pLA and then the recombinant vector was transformed into the competent cells Lactobacillus casei 525. The recombinant bacteria were grown at 37 degrees C, in MRS broth. Western blotting analysis with rabbit-anti-K88ac-LT(B) polyclonal serum indicated that the recombinant protein reacted with the specific antibodies. The results showed that the molecular weight of the recombinant protein was about 71.2 kD. The K88ac-LT(B) fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence mciroscopy and flow cytometric analysis. In addition, the survival of recombinant Lactobacillus casei 525 was studied in imitative gastrointestinal environments such as artificial gastro fluid (pH 1.5-5.5), artificial intestinal fluid, bile(0.3-3.0 g/L). The results indicated that the recombinant strain survived well in artificial gastric fluids at pH 2.5-4.5 in 5 h. The recombinant Lactobacillus casei 525 could slowly grow in the artificial intestinal fluid for different time, and could survive in 0.3% bile.
TI  - Live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli adherence to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - A quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated Lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of Caco-2 cells. Three species of Lactobacillus (L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (L. casei, L. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. All lactobacilli were able to attach to the Caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. The adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). The inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal L. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. The inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated L. acidophilus (p > 0.01). The number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the Caco-2 cells decreased when the number of L. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The heat-inactivated L. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei downregulates commensals' inflammatory signals in Crohn's disease mucosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The interaction of commensal bacteria with the intestinal immune system is an essential factor in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study of isolated commensal bacteria's effects on the mucosal immune response might be relevant for a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in IBD. METHODS: We investigated the immune responses to signals from the commensal Escherichia coli ATCC 35345 and the probiotic Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 in Crohn's disease (CD) mucosa. Ileal specimens were obtained during surgery from CD patients. Mucosal explants were incubated with L. casei or its genomic DNA; TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL1 were measured in the supernatant. Second, tissue expression of key proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-23p19, IL-12p35, IL-17F), and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2) was evaluated after incubation with L. casei or E. coli. Finally, combination experiments were carried out by incubating both strains with mucosal explants at different timepoints. RESULTS: Live L. casei significantly decreased secretion of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL1 by CD mucosa, but the effect was not reproduced by L. casei DNA. Second, live L. casei downregulated expression of IL-8, IL-6, and CXCL1 and did not modify expression of IL-23p19, IL-12p35, and IL-17F. In contrast, E. coli significantly upregulated expression of all these cytokines. Interestingly, combination experiments revealed the ability of L. casei to prevent and counteract the proinflammatory effects of E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: Live L. casei can counteract the proinflammatory effects of E. coli on CD inflamed mucosa by specific downregulation of key proinflammatory mediators.
TI  - Immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing intimin fragments produces antibodies able to inhibit the adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli to cultivated epithelial cells.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are frequently isolated as a cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. Its pathogenicity is distinguished by histopathological alterations at the site of infection, known as attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, in which bacterial virulence factors and host proteins participate. Intimin, a bacterial adhesin expressed by all EPEC described to date, is responsible for the intimate adherence of the bacteria to host cells and is essential for the formation of A/E lesions. Mucosal vaccination may represent an efficacious intervention to prevent EPEC infection and lower morbidity and mortality rates. Strategies for mucosal vaccinations that use lactic acid bacteria for the delivery of heterologous antigens rely on their safety profile and ability to stimulate the immune system. In the present work, we have constructed Lactobacillus casei strains expressing different fragments of intimin beta, a subtype that is frequently expressed by EPEC strains. Mucosal immunization of mice with L. casei expressing intimin fragments induced specific systemic and mucosal antibodies. These antibodies were able to recognize native intimin on the surface of EPEC and to inhibit in vitro EPEC binding to epithelial cells.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei suppress Escherichia coli-induced chemokine expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, some strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been reported to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis and to improve allergic symptoms, especially in young children. However, the mechanisms involved in these effects are not fully understood. Intestinal microbiota play critical roles in the development of host immune development and are recognized and regulated by the host through intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We thus hypothesized that LAB influence the host immune system through the activation of IECs. To begin testing this hypothesis, chemokine expression in IECs exposed to intestinal bacteria was investigated. METHODS: Caco-2 cell monolayers were stimulated with different concentrations of various live or heat-killed intestinal bacteria or bacterial components for up to 3 h. Changes in the gene expressions of various chemokines were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expressions of CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL10 and CX3CL1 were strongly induced by nonpathogenic Escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner and were partially induced by some commensal LAB. In contrast, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus casei did not induce these chemokine expressions. In addition, LGG significantly suppressed the expressions of CCL20 and CXCL10 induced by E. coli, peptidoglycan or flagellin when cultured simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: LGG and L. casei markedly suppressed E. coli-induced chemokine expression, presumably through the suppression of the Toll-like receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway, at least in part. The clinical importance of this suppressive effect and the mechanisms involved require further investigation; however, such effects can be used as a marker to identify clinically useful LAB.
TI  - Regulation of Lactobacillus casei sorbitol utilization genes requires DNA-binding transcriptional activator GutR and the conserved protein GutM.
AB  - Sequence analysis of the five genes (gutRMCBA) downstream from the previously described sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding Lactobacillus casei gutF gene revealed that they constitute a sorbitol (glucitol) utilization operon. The gutRM genes encode putative regulators, while the gutCBA genes encode the EIIC, EIIBC, and EIIA proteins of a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sorbitol phosphotransferase system (PTS(Gut)). The gut operon is transcribed as a polycistronic gutFRMCBA messenger, the expression of which is induced by sorbitol and repressed by glucose. gutR encodes a transcriptional regulator with two PTS-regulated domains, a galactitol-specific EIIB-like domain (EIIB(Gat) domain) and a mannitol/fructose-specific EIIA-like domain (EIIA(Mtl) domain). Its inactivation abolished gut operon transcription and sorbitol uptake, indicating that it acts as a transcriptional activator. In contrast, cells carrying a gutB mutation expressed the gut operon constitutively, but they failed to transport sorbitol, indicating that EIIBC(Gut) negatively regulates GutR. A footprint analysis showed that GutR binds to a 35-bp sequence upstream from the gut promoter. A sequence comparison with the presumed promoter region of gut operons from various firmicutes revealed a GutR consensus motif that includes an inverted repeat. The regulation mechanism of the L. casei gut operon is therefore likely to be operative in other firmicutes. Finally, gutM codes for a conserved protein of unknown function present in all sequenced gut operons. A gutM mutant, the first constructed in a firmicute, showed drastically reduced gut operon expression and sorbitol uptake, indicating a regulatory role also for GutM.
TI  - Flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase X limits chromosomal DNA replication.
AB  - We have investigated the hitherto unexplored possibility that differences in the  catalytic efficiencies of thymidylate synthases ThyX and ThyA, enzymes that produce the essential DNA precursor dTMP, have influenced prokaryotic genome evolution. We demonstrate that DNA replication speed in bacteria and archaea that contain the low-activity ThyX enzyme is up to 10-fold decreased compared with species that contain the catalytically more efficient ThyA. Our statistical studies of >400 genomes indicated that ThyA proteins are preferred for the replication of large genomes, providing further evidence that the thymidylate metabolism is limiting expansion of prokaryotic genomes. Because both ThyX and ThyA participate in frequent reciprocal gene replacement events, our observations indicate that the bacterial metabolism continues to modulate the size and composition of prokaryotic genomes. We also propose that the increased kinetic efficiency of thymidylate synthesis has contributed to extending the prokaryotic evolutionary potential.
TI  - Structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis folylpolyglutamate synthase complexed with ADP and AMPPCP.
AB  - Folate derivatives are essential vitamins for cell growth and replication, primarily because of their central role in reactions of one-carbon metabolism. Folates require polyglutamation to be efficiently retained within the cell and folate-dependent enzymes have a higher affinity for the polyglutamylated forms of this cofactor. Polyglutamylation is dependent on the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which catalyzes the sequential addition of several glutamates to folate. FPGS is essential for the growth and survival of important bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is a potential drug target. Here, the crystal structures of M. tuberculosis FPGS in complex with ADP and AMPPCP are reported at 2.0 and 2.3 angstroms resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a deeply buried nucleotide-binding site, as in the Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei FPGS structures, and a long extended groove for the binding of folate substrates. Differences from the E. coli and L. casei FPGS structures are seen in the binding of a key divalent cation, the carbamylation state of an essential lysine side chain and the adoption of an 'open' position by the active-site beta5-alpha6 loop. These changes point to coordinated events that are associated with dihydropteroate/folate binding and the catalysis of the new amide bond with an incoming glutamate residue.
TI  - New strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  - The C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis  IL1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (SBD) of the *-amylase of Streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein (CPH-SBD) was able to bind to the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei NRRL B-441 and to corn starch. Therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. At a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, CPH-SBD-displaying L. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of L. casei did not form any aggregates with corn starch. After incubation in simulated gastric juice (pH 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. When CPH-SBD-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. The survival of the amylose-coated CPH-SBD-displaying L. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of CPH-SBD-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.
TI  - Improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the Bifidobacterium catenulatum pBC1 replicon.
AB  - This study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pBC1, a cryptic plasmid from Bifidobacterium catenulatum L48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. These vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight Bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus casei. They showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. Vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the lacZalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in Escherichia coli. The functionality of the vectors for engineering Bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to Bifidobacterium longum. E. coli and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.
TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  - According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
TI  - Formation of an inverted repeat junction in the transposition of insertion sequence ISLC3 isolated from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - An insertion sequence, ISLC3, of 1351 bp has been isolated from Lactobacillus casei. Formation of IS circles containing a 3 bp spacer (complete junction) or deletion of 25 bp at the left inverted repeat (IRL) between the abutted IS ends of the ISLC3 junction region (deleted junction) was also discovered in the lactobacilli and Escherichia coli system studied. We found that the promoter formed by the complete junction P(jun) was more active than that formed by the 25 bp deleted junction P(djun) or the indigenous promoter P(IRL). The corresponding transcription start sites for both promoter P(jun) and P(IRL) as well as P(djun) were subsequently determined using a primer extension assay. The activity of transposase OrfAB of ISLC3 was also assayed using an in vitro system. It was found that this transposase preferred to cleave a single DNA strand at the IRR over the IRL end in the transposition process, suggesting that attack of one end by the other was oriented from IRR to IRL.
TI  - Constrained dansyl derivatives reveal bacterial specificity of highly conserved thymidylate synthases.
AB  - The elucidation of the structural/functional specificities of highly conserved enzymes remains a challenging area of investigation, and enzymes involved in cellular replication are important targets for functional studies and drug discovery. Thymidylate synthase (TS, ThyA) governs the synthesis of thymidylate for use in DNA synthesis. The present study focused on Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) and Escherichia coli TS (EcTS), which exhibit 50 % sequence identity and strong folding similarity. We have successfully designed and validated a chemical model in which linear, but not constrained, dansyl derivatives specifically complement the LcTS active site. Conversely, chemically constrained dansyl derivatives showed up to 1000-fold improved affinity for EcTS relative to the inhibitory activity of linear derivatives. This study demonstrates that the accurate design of small ligands can uncover functional features of highly conserved enzymes.
TI  - Expression of C-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus  lactis IL1403 in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - The C-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (CPH) of Lactococcus lactis  IL1403 produced intracellularly in Escherichia coli was able to attach to the surface of cells of Lactobacillus casei NRRL B-441, Bacillus subtilis 168, E. coli XL1-blue and Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO0216. Therefore, this domain is a suitable fusion partner for the adhesion of proteins to cell surfaces. The production of cell-surface adhesive proteins using this domain in Pichia pastoris is particularly attractive, because this organism has better capability to allow the correct folding of the recombinant proteins than prokaryotic hosts. However, when this domain is produced in this yeast, its cell-surface binding activity may be limited by glycosylation. In this study, therefore, we constructed a CPH mutant (CPHM) devoid of the potential N-glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. CPHM was successfully expressed extracellularly in P. pastoris (GS115) using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter with an alpha-mating factor signal sequence, whereas the native CPH was not produced in this host. Western blot analysis revealed that the apparent molecular size of CPHM was 18 kDa greater than that of CPH produced in E. coli (32 kDa), which is attributed to O-glycosylation. However, CPHM produced in P. pastoris was capable of binding to the cell surfaces despite its modification by the yeast, and its dissociation rate constant from the surface of L. casei NRRL B-441 cells was 3.5-fold lower than that of CPH produced in E. coli. These results demonstrate the applicability of the constructed domain (CPHM) for the production of cell-surface adhesive proteins in P. pastoris.
TI  - Cross-contamination in the kitchen: effect of hygiene measures.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of hygiene measures on cross-contamination of Campylobacter jejuni at home and to select a safe tracer organism for C. jejuni. METHODS AND RESULTS: Comparative tests were conducted with nonpathogenic Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei and L. casei was chosen as the safe tracer organism. Salads containing chicken breast fillet contaminated with a known number of C. jejuni and L. casei were prepared according to different cross-contamination scenarios and contamination levels of salads were determined. Cross-contamination could be strongly reduced when cleaning cutting board and cutlery with hot water (68 degrees C), but generally was not prevented using consumer-style cleaning methods for hands and cutting board. CONCLUSIONS: Dish-washing does not sufficiently prevent cross-contamination, thus different cutting boards for raw meat and other ingredients should be used and meat-hand contact should be avoided or hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap. Lactobacillus casei can be used as a safe tracer organism for C. jejuni in consumer observational studies. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Cross-contamination plays an important role in the transmission of food-borne illness, especially for C. jejuni. This study delivers suitable data to quantitatively assess the risk of campylobacteriosis caused by cross-contamination and it shows the effect of different preventive hygiene measures.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - Gut immune stimulation by non pathogenic Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria. Comparison with a probiotic strain.
AB  - We analyzed the gut immune stimulation induced by Gram-positive bacteria: non probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1462 and Lactobacillus acidophilus A9; two potentially probiotic strains: L. acidophilus CRL 924 and Lactobacillusdelbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 423; comparatively with a probiotic strain: Lactobacillus casei CRL 431. We also studied Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli 129 and E. coli 13-7 in BALB/c mice. All the strains increased the number of IgA+ cells. We analyzed the cytokines IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-17, IL-12, IL-6 and MIP-1alpha. The Gram(+) strains increased the number of IL-10+ cells. Gram(-) strains did not increase IL-10+ cells, but they increased the number of IL-12+ cells. The probiotic strain increased mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha. In the study of the receptors TLR-2, TLR-4 and CD-206, we demonstrated that only the probiotic strain increased the number of CD-206+ cells. All the Gram(+) strains increased the number of TLR-2+ cells and the Gram(-) strains of the TLR-4+ cells. The probiotic strain induced the release of IL-6 by a preparation enriched in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria activated different immune receptors and induced a different cytokine profile. The probiotic strain showed a great activity on the immune cells and the enriched population in IEC, activating mainly cells of the innate immune system.
TI  - Mutagenesis of folylpolyglutamate synthetase indicates that dihydropteroate and tetrahydrofolate bind to the same site.
AB  - The folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) enzyme of Escherichia coli differs from  that of Lactobacillus casei in having dihydrofolate synthetase activity, which catalyzes the production of dihydrofolate from dihydropteroate. The present study undertook mutagenesis to identify structural elements that are directly responsible for the functional differences between the two enzymes. The amino terminal domain (residues 1-287) of the E. coli FPGS was found to bind tetrahydrofolate and dihydropteroate with the same affinity as the intact enzyme. The domain-swap chimera proteins between the E. coli and the L. casei enzymes possess both folate or pteroate binding properties and enzymatic activities of their amino terminal portion, suggesting that the N-terminal domain determines the folate substrate specificity. Recent structural studies have identified two unique folate binding sites, the omega loop in L. casei FPGS and the dihydropteroate binding loop in the E. coli enzyme. Mutants with swapped omega loops retained the activities and folate or pteroate binding properties of the rest of the enzyme. Mutating L. casei FPGS to contain an E. coli FPGS dihydropteroate binding loop did not alter its substrate specificity to using dihydropteroate as a substrate. The mutant D154A, a residue specific for the dihydropteroate binding site in E. coli FPGS, and D151A, the corresponding mutant in the L. casei enzyme, were both defective in using tetrahydrofolate as their substrate, suggesting that the binding site corresponding to the E. coli pteroate binding site is also the tetrahydrofolate binding site for both enzymes. Tetrahydrofolate diglutamate was a slightly less effective substrate than the monoglutamate with the wild-type enzyme but was a 40-fold more effective substrate with the D151A mutant. This suggests that the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate binding site identified in the L. casei ternary structure may bind diglutamate and polyglutamate folate derivatives.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - Role of Y94 in proton and hydride transfers catalyzed by thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyzes the substitution of a carbon-bound proton in  a uracil base by a methyl group to yield thymine in the de novo biosynthesis of this DNA base. The enzymatic mechanism involves making and breaking several covalent bonds. Traditionally, a conserved tyrosine (Y94 in Escherichia coli, Y146 in Lactobacillus casei, and Y135 in humans) was assumed to serve as the general base catalyzing the proton abstraction. That assumption was examined here by comparing the nature of the proton abstraction using wild-type (wt) E. coli TS (ecTS) and its Y94F mutant (with a turnover rate reduced by 2 orders of magnitude). A subsequent hydride transfer was also studied using the wt and Y94F. The physical nature of both H-transfer steps was examined by determining intrinsic kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Surprisingly, the findings did not suggest a direct role for Y94 in the proton abstraction step. The effect of this mutation on the subsequent hydride transfer was examined by a comparison of the temperature dependency of the intrinsic KIE on both the wt and the mutant. The intrinsic KIEs for Y94F at physiological temperatures were slightly smaller than those for wt but, otherwise, were as temperature-independent, suggesting a perfectly preorganized reaction coordinate for both enzymes. At reduced temperatures, however, the KIE for the mutant increased with a decrease in temperature, indicating a poorly preorganized reaction coordinate. Other kinetic and structural properties were also compared, and the findings suggested that Y94 is part of a H-bond network that plays a critical role at a step between the proton and the hydride transfers, presumably the dissociation of H4folate from the covalently bound intermediate. The possibility that no single residue serves as the general base in question but, rather, that the whole network of H-bonds at the active site catalyzes proton abstraction is discussed.
TI  - Characterisation of pSMA23, a 3.5 kbp plasmid of Lactobacillus casei, and application for heterologous expression in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pSMA23 isolated from Lactobacillus casei A23 was determined. Plasmid pSMA23 is a 3497bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 38.18%. Four putative open reading frames were identified. Based on homology, two orfs were identified as genes encoding replication initiation (Rep) and mobilisation (Mob) protein, respectively. Various regulatory regions like promoters, ribosome binding site (RBS), transcriptional terminators were deduced from the sequences of rep and mob. The origin of replication (dso) was predicted. Shuttle vectors pL142 and pL157 were constructed for Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus using rep gene and ori of pSMA23 for replication in Lactobacillus, the ori of the commercial vector pBluescript SkII+ for replication in E. coli, and the erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pE194 and pC194, respectively, as selection markers. Transformants of E. coli and Lactobacillus were obtained on media containing erythromycin and chloramphenicol, respectively, suggesting expression of the ermC and cat194 genes in both organisms. The shsp gene of plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus encoding a small heat shock protein and the Lactobacillus plantarum cbh gene encoding conjugated bile salts hydrolase were cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Lb. casei LK1 with the aid of pSMA23-derived vectors.
TI  - Improved methods for the preparation of [3H]folate polyglutamates: biosynthesis with Lactobacillus casei and enzymatic synthesis with Escherichia coli folylpolyglutamate synthetase.
AB  - Tritiated forms of polyglutamyl folates are not commercially available but are often needed for experimental uses in folate biochemistry. Thus, considerable interest exists in the preparation of polyglutamyl [(3)H]folates from the commercial monoglutamyl [(3)H]folates. However, refinement of established enzymatic and biological synthesis methods is still needed. To address this need we developed improved procedures for the conversion of monoglutamyl [(3)H]folates to various polyglutamyl forms. In the bacterial synthesis, Lactobacillus casei was grown in the presence of 1 ng/ml (2.27 nM) [(3)H]folic acid in Folic Acid Casei Medium. Washed cells were resuspended in 2% sodium ascorbate containing 10mM beta-mercaptoethanol and heated to release the folates. The extracted [(3)H]folates were purified on a folate-binding protein affinity column and then applied to a Sephadex G-10 column to separate the eluted poly- from the monoglutamyl folate species. High performance liquid chromatography with multichannel electrochemical detection indicated that the bacterial synthesis yielded predominantly polyglutamates of [(3)H]5-methyltetrahydrofolate and [(3)H]5-formyltetrahydrofolate (di- through heptaglutamates). The alternative method consisted of enzymatic polyglutamylation of [(3)H]folic acid catalyzed by recombinant Escherichia coli folylpolyglutamate synthetase. This enzymatic synthesis yielded predominantly tri-, tetra-, and pentaglutamyl species for the [(3)H]folate substrate.
TI  - Mutational and biochemical analyses of the endolysin Lys(gaY) encoded by the Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131T phage phi gaY.
AB  - The Lys(gaY) of Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131(T) phage phigaY endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the Escherichia coli/His.Tag system. Zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that Lys(gaY) lysed over 20 heated Gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. The enzymatic activity had the pH and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of Lys(gaY) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gaY) domain, G10, D12, E33, D36, H60, Y61, D96, E98, V124, L132, and D198; in the SH3b(gaY) domain, Y272 and W284. In addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gaY) domain of N-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of Lys(gaY). These mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gaY) (in which two acidic residues of D12 and E98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and SH3b(gaY) promotes beta/alpha(gaY) possibly through cell-wall binding function. The purified His-tagged SH3b(gaY) domain containing 94 residues from S217 to K310 (i) bound to Gram-positive bacteria susceptible to Lys(gaY), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of L. gasseri JCM 1131(T), L. casei IAM 1045, Lactococcus lactis C2, L. lactis MG 1363, and Enterococcus hirae IAM 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of Lys(gaY), and (iv) impeded autolysis of L. gasseri JCM 1131(T) in buffer systems. A truncated protein HDeltaSH3b(gaY) lacking in N-terminal 21 residues (from S217 to E237) of SH3b(gaY) and an amino-acid substituted protein HSH3b(gaY)G (W284G) lost the activities of HSH3b(gaY), showing that the N-terminal region and W284 probably play important roles in the SH3b(gaY) function(s).
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis populations].
AB  - The effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. The three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (Lactobacillus casei CRL_431 and L. acidophilus CRL_730 CHR HANSEN) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR-35) culture. About 10(9) CFU/ mL of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees C during its shelf life, about 30 days. Bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. Results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The yogurt with added probiotics and L. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. S. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. This study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. Nevertheless, the use of L. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - Prevention of pathogenic Escherichia coli infection in mice and stimulation of macrophage activation in rats by an oral administration of probiotic Lactobacillus casei I-5.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei I-5 isolated from an alcohol fermentation broth enhanced immunity and prevented pathogenic infection as a probiotic. Mice fed with I-5 cells for 11 days prior to an intraperitoneal challenge with pathogenic Escherichia coli Juhl exhibited a high survival rate compared with the control group. Rats fed with I-5 cells for 10 days significantly increased the phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages. In a cell culture system employing peritoneal macrophages from rats, the I-5 administration activated NF-kappaB stimulated by LPS. It also enhanced LPS-stimulated IL-12 and TNF-alpha production, but not IL-6 production. These results show that L. casei I-5 effectively prevented infection by pathogenic E. coli possibly through the activation of peritoneal macrophages. The strain would be useful to prevent pathogenic microbial infections in humans and farm animals.
TI  - New method for evaluation of genotoxicity, based on the use of real-time PCR and  lysogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A method for the detection of the SOS response as measured by the liberation of resident prophages from the genomes of their hosts is described. It is based on the use of two converging oligonucleotides that flank the attP attachment site of the phage as primers for real-time PCR. Amplification was observed only after the phage DNA became excised. The system responds to both chemicals and physical conditions. Quantitative data on the concentration and/or potency of the genotoxic condition were obtained. Results can be achieved within 1 day and are less susceptible to possible toxic effects than phage generation or other methods that require DNA synthesis. The use of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria widens the range of compounds that can be tested because it eliminates impermeability problems derived from the particular composition of each cell wall type.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - Oral administration of probiotic bacteria (E. coli Nissle, E. coli O83, Lactobacillus casei) influences the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in BALB/c mice.
AB  - Our study examined whether repeated preventive oral administration of live probiotic bacterial strains Escherichia coli O83:K24:H31 (Ec O83), Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 O6:K5:H1 (Ec Nis) and Lactobacillus casei DN 114001 (Lc) can protect mice against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. A significant decrease in average symptom score was observed in Ec O83-, Ec Nis- and Lc-pretreated group (p < 0.05). Significant differences in body mass loss between Lc pretreated mice with DSS-induced colitis were found when compared with nontreated mice (p < 0.05). PBS pretreated mice had a significantly shorter colon than Ec O83-, Ec Nis- and Lc-pretreated mice (p < 0.05). Administration of Lc significantly decreased the severity of DSS induced histological marks of inflammation (p < 0.05). A significant difference (p < 0.05) was also found in specific IgA level against given probiotic in enteral fluid between colitic mice and healthy mice pretreated with Ec 083 and Ec Nis.
TI  - Lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and E. coli nissle induce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) with the cell debris and cell extraction of different probiotic strains is similar or species specific. METHODS: Three strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli, and E. coli nissle were sonicated and centrifuged in order to divide them into cell extract and cell debris. PBMNC were separated by density gradient and incubated for 36 h with either the cell debris or the cell extract of single strains of probiotic bacteria in doses from 10(2) to 10(8) CFU/mL. Cell supernatants were taken and interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Depending on the species super-family, the strains had different stimulation patterns. Except for both L. casei strains, the cell extract of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli had less stimulating capacity than cell debris, whereas the cell extract of E. coli nissle had similar stimulating properties to that of the cell debris of the strain and significantly more stimulating capacity than that of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. The cell debris of bifidobacteria stimulated more cytokine release than the cell debris of lactobacilli. The cell debris of lactobacilli did not have a stimulating capacity when lower concentrations were used. Neither cell extraction nor cell debris had an inhibitory effect on the production of the tested cytokines by stimulated PBMNC. CONCLUSION: The incubation of probiotic strains, which have been used in clinical trials for inflammatory diseases, with immunocompetent cells leads to different species specific reactions. High IL-10 response to cell debris of bifidobacteria and E. coli nissle can be found. This corresponds to positive effects of bifidobacteria and E. coli nissle in clinical trials for inflammatory bowel disease compared to negative outcomes obtained with lactobacilli.
TI  - Antibacterial agent discovery using thymidylate synthase biolibrary screening.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS, ThyA) catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to 2'-deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate, an essential precursor for DNA synthesis. A specific inhibition of this enzyme induces bacterial cell death. As a second round lead optimization design, new 1,2-naphthalein derivatives have been synthesized and tested against a TS-based biolibrary, including human thymidylate synthase (hTS). Docking studies have been performed to rationalize the experimentally observed affinity profiles of 1,2-naphthalein compounds toward Lactobacillus casei TS and hTS. The best TS inhibitors have been tested against a number of clinical isolates of Gram-positive-resistant bacterial strains. Compound 3,3-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-1H,3H-naphtho[1,2-c]furan-1-one (5) showed significant antibacterial activity, no in vitro toxicity, and dose-response effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC=0.5-2.5 microg/mL) clinical isolate strains, which are resistant to at least 17 of the best known antibacterial agents, including vancomycin. So far this compound can be regarded as a leading antibacterial agent.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Modulation of apoptosis in intestinal lymphocytes by a probiotic bacteria in Crohn's disease.
AB  - Apoptosis of active T lymphocytes constitutes a major control mechanism of immune homeostasis and tolerance. In Crohn's disease, abnormal activation of mucosal T lymphocytes against enteric bacteria is the key event triggering intestinal inflammation. Resistance of lymphocytes to apoptosis has been proposed as the pathogenetic defect. We examined the influence of bacteria-mucosa interactions on apoptosis of mucosal T lymphocytes. Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 12 patients with Crohn's disease. Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured with nonpathogenic Escherichia coli ATCC 35345, Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001, or no bacteria. Cytokine release was measured in supernatant, and mononuclear cells were isolated for phenotypic characterization and Bcl-2 family protein expression. Coculture of inflamed tissue with L. casei significantly reduced the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (P < 0.05). In addition, coculture with L. casei significantly reduced the number of T cells displaying the IL-2 receptor in the lamina propria. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in lamina propria lymphocytes was also reduced after coculture with L. casei, and the percentage of deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling positive lymphocytes increased. The nonpathogenic E. coli strain had no significant effect. In conclusion, L. casei reduces the number of activated T lymphocytes in the lamina propria of Crohn's disease mucosa. A balanced, local microecology may restore immune homeostasis.
TI  - Effects of a Lactobacillus casei synbiotic on serum lipoprotein, intestinal microflora, and organic acids in rats.
AB  - The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 synbiotic diets: 1) containing Lactobacillus casei ASCC 292 and fructooligosaccharides (LF diet); 2) containing L. casei ASCC 292 and maltodextrin (LM diet); and 3) containing L. casei ASCC 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin (LFM diet) to reduce serum cholesterol in male Wistar rats. The effect of the synbiotic diets on intestinal microflora, concentration of organic acids, and the possibility of translocation of lactobacilli were also investigated. The LFM diet lowered serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, whereas the LM diet increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. However, synbiotic diets did not contribute to a change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level compared with the control diet. There was a decrease in the population of staphylococci, bacteroides, Escherichia coli, and total coliforms in most bowel regions with the LFM diet compared with the control (which did not contain any synbiotic). In general, the LFM diet contributed to a higher concentration of lactic acid that may have contributed to the decrease in the population of pathogenic microorganisms compared with the control. Fructooligosaccharide was the preferred substrate for production of acetic acid. Results from this study showed that the synbiotic diet that contained L. casei ASCC 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin beneficially altered cholesterol levels and produced a healthier bowel microbial population without translocation of lactobacilli to other organs.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of plasmid pLC494 isolated from human intestinal Lactobacillus casei: construction of an Escherichia coli-Lactobacillus shuttle vector.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pLC494 isolated from Lactobacillus casei L-49 was determined. Plasmid pLC494 is an 8846-bp long circular molecule with a G+C content of 41.5%. Two putative open reading frames, ORF4 (282 amino acids) and ORF5 (169 amino acids), were identified as replication proteins A and B that revealed 100 and 99% similarity, respectively, with the replication proteins of plasmid pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912. Upstream of ORF4 were the four repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and one imperfect motif), a putative ribosome binding site, a -10 region, and a -35 region. The shuttle vector pJLE4942 (5318 bp) was constructed using repA from pLC494, a multiple cloning site, ColE1 ori, the ori of gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene from pJIR418 as a selection marker. Transformation of several lactic acid bacteria with the vector pJLE4942 indicated that this vector might be useful as a genetic tool for the intestinal lactobacilli.
TI  - Development of a host-vector system for Lactobacillus plantarum L137 isolated from a traditional fermented food produced in the Philippines.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum NC13, a strain derived from the L. plantarum strain L137  isolated from a traditional fermented food produced in the Philippines, contains 9 of the 15 plasmids in the parental strain. To construct a shuttle vector between L. plantarum and Escherichia coli for genetic manipulation of L137 and its derivatives, recombinant plasmids were prepared by using the 9-plasmid DNA mixture and an E. coli vector, pBluescript II SK+. The resultant recombinant plasmids were re-transferred to L. plantarum NCL21, an NC13-derived strain cured of 3 of the 9 plasmids, and 3 recombinant plasmids were obtained. The smallest plasmid, pRN14, contained a small cryptic plasmid, pLTK2, which is one of the plasmids in L. plantarum L137. Thus, the complete nucleotide sequence of pLTK2 was determined. The pLTK2 is 2295 bp in length, and has a major open reading frame of 951 bp. An encoded sequence of 317-amino acids showed extensive similarity with genes encoding replication protein (repA). A putative replication origin in pLTK2 also showed high homology to those of other gram-positive bacterial plasmids that replicate by the rolling circle mechanism. The shuttle vector pRN14 contained the erythromycin resistance gene and the ColE1 and pLTK2 replication origins. Transformation of L. plantarum strains with pRN14 by electroporation was optimized to give a transformation efficiency of 2 x 10(4) transformants/ mug plasmid. Plasmid pRN14 was stably maintained in strain NCL21, as well as in L. casei K95-5.
TI  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to human HT29 tissue cell cultures. Effects on adhesion of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. Generally, CGMP exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. The CGMP reduced adhesion of VTEC strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of EPEC strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. The CGMP also reduced the adhesion of L. pentosus and L. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. A slight but significant reduction of L. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either Dsv. desulfuricans or L. gasseri. Further investigation of the dose response relationships with the E. coli strains gave IC50 values ranging between 0.12 and 1.06 mg/mL.
TI  - Role of intestinal epithelial cells in immune effects mediated by gram-positive probiotic bacteria: involvement of toll-like receptors.
AB  - The mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria exert their effects on the immune system are not completely understood, but the epithelium may be a crucial player in the orchestration of the effects induced. In a previous work, we observed that some orally administered strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased the number of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing cells in the small intestine without a concomitant increase in the CD4(+) T-cell population, indicating that some LAB strains induce clonal expansion only of B cells triggered to produce IgA. The present work aimed to study the cytokines induced by the interaction of probiotic LAB with murine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in healthy animals. We focused our investigation mainly on the secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) necessary for the clonal expansion of B cells previously observed with probiotic bacteria. The role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in such interaction was also addressed. The cytokines released by primary cultures of IEC in animals fed with Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 or Lactobacillus helveticus R389 were determined. Cytokines were also determined in the supernatants of primary cultures of IEC of unfed animals challenged with different concentrations of viable or nonviable lactobacilli and Escherichia coli, previously blocked or not with anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4. We concluded that the small intestine is the place where a major distinction would occur between probiotic LAB and pathogens. This distinction comprises the type of cytokines released and the magnitude of the response, cutting across the line that separates IL-6 necessary for B-cell differentiation, which was the case with probiotic lactobacilli, from inflammatory levels of IL-6 for pathogens.
TI  - Structure and hydride transfer mechanism of a moderate thermophilic dihydrofolate reductase from Bacillus stearothermophilus and comparison to its mesophilic and hyperthermophilic homologues.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from a moderate thermophilic organism, Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been cloned and expressed. Physical characterization of the protein (BsDHFR) indicates that it is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 18,694.6 Da (0.8), coincident with the mass of 18 694.67 Da calculated from the primary sequence. Determination of the X-ray structure of BsDHFR provides the first structure for a monomeric DHFR from a thermophilic organism, indicating a high degree of conservation of structure in relation to all chromosomal DHFRs. Structurally based sequence alignment of DHFRs indicates the following levels of sequence identity and similarity for BsDHFR: 38 and 58% with Escherichia coli, 35 and 56% with Lactobacillus casei, and 23 and 40% with Thermotoga maritima, respectively. Steady state kinetic isotope effect studies indicate an ordered kinetic mechanism at elevated temperatures, with NADPH binding first to the enzyme. This converts to a more random mechanism at reduced temperatures, reflected in a greatly reduced K(m) for dihydrofolate at 20 degrees C in relation to that at 60 degrees C. A reduction in either temperature or pH reduces the degree to which the hydride transfer step is rate-determining for the second-order reaction of DHF with the enzyme-NADPH binary complex. Transient state kinetics have been used to study the temperature dependence of the isotope effect on hydride transfer at pH 9 between 10 and 50 degrees C. The data support rate-limiting hydride transfer with a moderate enthalpy of activation (E(a) = 5.5 kcal/mol) and a somewhat greater temperature dependence for the kinetic isotope effect than predicted from classical behavior [A(H)/A(D) = 0.57 (0.15)]. Comparison of kinetic parameters for BsDHFR to published data for DHFR from E. coli and T. maritima shows a decreasing trend in efficiency of hydride transfer with increasing thermophilicity of the protein. These results are discussed in the context of the capacity of each enzyme to optimize H-tunneling from donor (NADPH) to acceptor (DHF) substrates.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Design of combinatorial protein libraries of optimal size.
AB  - In this article we introduce a computational procedure, OPTCOMB (Optimal Pattern  of Tiling for COMBinatorial library design), for designing protein hybrid libraries that optimally balance library size with quality. The proposed procedure is directly applicable to oligonucleotide ligation-based protocols such as GeneReassembly, DHR, SISDC, and many more. Given a set of parental sequences and the size ranges of the parental sequence fragments, OPTCOMB determines the optimal junction points (i.e., crossover positions) and the fragment contributing parental sequences at each one of the junction points. By rationally selecting the junction points and the contributing parental sequences, the number of clashes (i.e., unfavorable interactions) in the library is systematically minimized with the aim of improving the overall library quality. Using OPTCOMB, hybrid libraries containing fragments from three different dihydrofolate reductase sequences (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus casei) are computationally designed. Notably, we find that there exists an optimal library size when both the number of clashes between the fragments composing the library and the average number of clashes per hybrid in the library are minimized. Results reveal that the best library designs typically involve complex tiling patterns of parental segments of unequal size hard to infer without relying on computational means.
TI  - Oral probiotic bacterial administration suppressed allergic responses in an ovalbumin-induced allergy mouse model.
AB  - This study investigated whether orally administered probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus casei) and a gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli) function as allergic immune modulators to prevent food allergy, according to the hygiene hypothesis. C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and cholera toxin for 5 weeks. After sensitization, the OVA-induced mice that were not treated with bacteria had significantly increased levels of OVA-specific IgE, total IgE, and IgG1 in sera, as well as scab-covered tails. In comparison, groups treated with B. bifidum BGN4 (BGN4), L. casei 911 (L. casei), or Escherichia coli MC4100 (E. coli) had decreased levels of OVA-specific IgE, total IgE, and IgG1, and decreased levels of mast cell degranulation and tail scabs. OVA-specific IgA levels were decreased in BGN4- and L. casei-treated groups. In conclusion, administration of E. coli, BGN4, or L. casei decreased the OVA-induced allergy response. However, a normal increase in body weight was inhibited in the E. coli-treated mice and in the montreated mice groups during allergy sensitization. Thus, BGN4 and L. casei appear to be useful probiotic bacteria for the prevention of allergy.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 inhibits the ability of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients to adhere to and to invade intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Ileal lesions in 36.4% of patients with Crohn's disease are colonized by pathogenic adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro inhibitory effects of the probiotic strain, Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001, on adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells by adherent-invasive E. coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients. The experiments were performed with undifferentiated Intestine-407 cells and with undifferentiated or differentiated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells were assessed by counting CFU. The inhibitory effects of L. casei were determined after coincubation with adherent-invasive E. coli or after preincubation of intestinal cells with L. casei prior to infection with adherent-invasive E. coli. Inhibitory effects of L. casei on adherent-invasive E. coli adhesion to differentiated and undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells reached 75% to 84% in coincubation and 43% to 62% in preincubation experiments, according to the cell lines used. Addition of L. casei culture supernatant to the incubation medium increased L. casei adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and enhanced the inhibitory effects of L. casei. The inhibitory effects on E. coli invasion paralleled those on adhesion. This effect was not due to a bactericidal effect on adherent-invasive E. coli or to a cytotoxic effect on epithelial intestinal cells. As Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 strongly inhibits interaction of adherent-invasive E. coli with intestinal epithelial cells, this finding suggests that the probiotic strain could be of therapeutic value in Crohn's disease.
TI  - An esterase gene from Lactobacillus casei cotranscribed with genes encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system and regulated by a LevR-like activator and sigma54 factor.
AB  - A new esterase-encoding gene was found in the draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus casei BL23 (CECT5275). It is located in an operon together with genes encoding the EIIA, EIIB, EIIC, and EIID proteins of a mannose class phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. After overproduction in Escherichia coli and purification, the esterase could hydrolyze acetyl sugars, hence the operon was named esu for esterase-sugar uptake genes. Upstream of the genes encoding the EII components (esuABCD) and the esterase (esuE), two genes transcribed in the opposite sense were found which encode a Bacillus subtilis LevR-like transcriptional activator (esuR) and a sigma54-like transcriptional factor (rpoN). As compared with the wild-type strain, elevated fructose phosphorylation was detected in L. casei mutants constitutively expressing the esu operon. However, none of the many sugars tested could induce the esu operon. The fact that EsuE exhibits esterase activity on acetyl sugars suggests that this operon could be involved in the uptake and metabolism of esterified sugars. Expression of the esu operon is similar to that of the B. subtilis lev operon: it contains a -12,-24 consensus promoter typical of sigma54-regulated genes, and EsuR and RpoN are essential for its transcription which is negatively regulated by EIIB(Esu). The esuABCDE transcription unit represents the first sigma54-regulated operon in lactobacilli. Furthermore, replacement of His852 in the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system regulation domain II of EsuR with Ala indicated that the transcription activator function of EsuR is inhibited by EIIB(Esu)-mediated phosphorylation at His852.
TI  - Screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  - Antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  The ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. The study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (SOS-Chromotest for genotoxicity in Escherichia coli and Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (Comet assay for genotoxicity in Caco-2 enterocytes). A high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Inhibition of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one L. acidophilus strain. All the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. Strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. Concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in a murine (BALB/ c mice) model. Mice were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of IgA+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end of the feeding periods. For the preventive effect against Esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). Mice were challenged with an infective dose of enteroinvasive Esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. The colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory IgA specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (ELISA test). Results showed that the unspecific immune response enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of IgA+ cells in the small intestine). Treated animals showed less Esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-Esch. coli IgA in the intestinal fluids. These results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive Esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures added to commercial yogurt over a known population of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 during yogurt storage was evaluated. Two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus) were inoculated with known populations (106 UFC/g) of either L. monocytogenes or E. coli O157:H7 in three different times and stored for 32 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, the added pathogens and pH was evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures reduced the population of L. monocytogenes in 8 days, the population of E. coli O157:H7 in 16; yogurt with no additional probiotics took 20 days to reduce L. monocytogenes to non-detectable levels and even after 28 days of storage, E. coli O157:H7 was cultured. In this work, the beneficial effects of additional probiotic cultures in yogurt is confirmed again.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 inhibits the increase in paracellular permeability of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli-infected T84 cells.
AB  - Probiotics are living microorganisms which, when ingested in adequate amounts, exert health benefits toward the host. For instance, probiotics might act through reinforcement of the intestinal epithelial barrier function. The goal of the present study was to determine whether Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 could abrogate the increase in paracellular permeability induced by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. We used the human colon T84 cell line infected with a wild-type enteropathogenic E. coli (strain E2348/69). Paracellular permeability was followed by monitoring transepithelial electrical resistance variations and by observing zonula occludens-1 distribution. Two infection procedures were used: co-incubation (the pathogenic and probiotic strains were simultaneously incubated with T84 cells) and post-infection (the probiotic was added in the presence of pathogenic bacteria 3 h after the beginning of the infection). We also investigated the effect of L. casei on enteropathogenic E. coli adhesion. L. casei DN-114 001 inhibited, in a dose-dependent-manner, the decrease in enteropathogenic E. coli-induced transepithelial electrical resistance and zonula occludens-1 redistribution using two different infection procedures. However, L. casei did not inhibit pathogenic strain adhesion. L. casei DN-114 001 inhibited the increase in EPEC-induced paracellular permeability. This property could partially explain the previously observed health benefits of this probiotic for human natural defenses, such as those associated with prevention of diarrhea.
TI  - Selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in Tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, Tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin, menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of Clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. These two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli at 100 microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. Structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the C-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.
TI  - A non-dairy probiotic's (poi) influence on changing the gastrointestinal tract's  microflora environment.
AB  - JUSTIFICATION: Yogurt has been historically used to restore gut microflora adversely affected by antibiotic treatment. Certain fermented dairy products are probiotics; "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host." Microorganisms in foods may benefit certain health conditions such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. A potential new probiotic from a Polynesian traditional food is poi; a starchy paste made from the corm of taro plants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if consumption of poi, a potential non-dairy probiotic, altered the microflora in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy adults. METHODS: A cross-over clinical study included 18 subjects (19-64 years of age) divided into a poi group (n = 10) and control group (n = 8). The study duration of 14 weeks consisted of a 2-week washout, 4-week treatment or control, a subsequent 2-week washout, cross-over of 4-week treatment or control, and a final 2-week washout. Subjects thus served as their own controls. While receiving the poi treatment, participants consumed fresh poi (1-2 days old) three times a day (130 g/meal or approximately 1/2 cup/meal); the control group did not. Both groups filled out 3-day dietary records to ensure compliance. Measurable outcomes included pre- and post-treatment microbiological fecal culture analyses. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in total bacterial counts following a poi diet versus following a control diet, nor were significant differences found in counts of specific bacterial species. Lactococcus tends to be higher in poi when it is analyzed for specific bacteria, but the poi consumption in our study did not alter the mean concentration of individual bacterial species (log10 CFU/g wet feces) for Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. No significant differences in stool frequency or consistency were observed between the treatment and control group periods. CONCLUSION: Poi consumption did not significantly alter total or individual bacterial counts in the human gastrointestinal tract. Further research might determine if "sour poi" (3-4 days old) has a greater affect than "fresh poi" (1-2 days old) as a potential probiotic, and a larger trial with longer diet durations may detect more subtle effects of poi consumption on bacterial counts.
TI  - Escherichia coli FolC structure reveals an unexpected dihydrofolate binding site  providing an attractive target for anti-microbial therapy.
AB  - In some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the addition of L-glutamate to dihydropteroate (dihydrofolate synthetase activity) and the subsequent additions of L-glutamate to tetrahydrofolate (folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity) are catalyzed by the same enzyme, FolC. The crystal structure of E. coli FolC is described in this paper. It showed strong similarities to that of the FPGS enzyme of Lactobacillus casei within the ATP binding site and the catalytic site, as do all other members of the Mur synthethase superfamily. FolC structure revealed an unexpected dihydropteroate binding site very different from the folate site identified previously in the FPGS structure. The relevance of this site is exemplified by the presence of phosphorylated dihydropteroate, a reaction intermediate in the DHFS reaction. L. casei FPGS is considered a relevant model for human FPGS. As such, the presence of a folate binding site in E. coli FolC, which is different from the one seen in FPGS enzymes, provides avenues for the design of specific inhibitors of this enzyme in antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Analysis of promoter sequences from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 and their activity in other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To clone and analyse seven putative promoter fragments (pepC, pepN, pepX, pepO, pepE, pepO2, hsp17) from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 for their expression in Lact. helveticus CNRZ32, Lact. casei ATCC334 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. METHODS AND RESULTS: Promoter fragments were fused to the promoter-less beta-glucuronidase (gusA) gene on pNZ272(RBS-) (ATG-). The resulting constructs were evaluated for their ability to drive the expression of active GusA with 0.5 mmol l(-1) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide. All promoters except P(pepN)::gusA were active in the examined strains. Northern hybridization was performed to examine the promoter strength. Sequence analysis of these promoters identified well conserved putative ribosomal binding and putative -10 hexamers sites. CONCLUSIONS: Seven promoter fragments from Lact. helveticus CNRZ32 were recognized in the lactic acid bacteria, Lact. casei ATCC334 and L. lactis MG1363, as well as in Escherichia coli. P(pepN)::gusA could not be maintained in the strains examined because of toxicity associated with heterologous protein over-expression driven by P(pepN). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed that desirable levels of heterologous food-grade protein production in GRAS organisms can be obtained with the application of natural promoter fragments from closely related organisms.
TI  - In vitro screening of potential probiotic activities of selected lactobacilli isolated from unpasteurized milk products for incorporation into soft cheese.
AB  - The aim was to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli from 88 strains isolated from unpasteurized milk and cheese products, and to incorporate these bacteria in a viable state into a soft cheese, without changing its quality. The survival of these bacteria was assessed in acidic and bile conditions, after freezing at -80 degrees C. Four strains from unpasteurized Camembert--two Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lb. paracasei/casei strains--were identified and typed by PCR and PFGE and were found to display potentially probiotic characteristics in addition to resistance to low pH and bile. These characteristics were resistance to lysozyme, adhesion to CACO-2 cells, antimicrobial effects against common foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, innocuity following the ingestion of high doses by mice and appropriate antibiotic susceptibility profiles. The potential of Lb. plantarum strain UCMA 3037 for incorporation into a soft cheese (Pont-l'Eveque registered designation of origin (RDO)) was investigated. This strain grew well and survived in sufficient numbers (more than 10(7) cfu/g throughout the shelf-life of the product) in the cheese. This strain did not change the quality score of the product until the best before date (75 days after manufacture). Thus, unpasteurized Camembert is a natural source of potentially probiotic lactobacilli, which could be used as an additive in the development of potentially probiotic soft cheeses. Further work is required to demonstrate the persistence and efficacy of these strains in the human host upon ingestion.
TI  - [Quantitative characterization of antagonistic activity of lactobacilli].
AB  - In this work the method of serial dilutions of lactobacilli in two-layer agar was used. On the agar surface bacterial or fungal cultures were applied at different time intervals. A special quantitative characteristic was introduced. L. plantarum strain 8P-A3 was shown to have the maximum antagonistic activity. In great amounts L. casei and L. reuteri are capable to suppress the growth of bacteria and fungi. All lactobacilli under study produced a pronounced bactericidal effect on Pseudomonas, had different influence on the viability of Escherichia and staphylococci and exhibited fungistatic and fungicidal action only when inoculated at high concentrations.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Optimization of bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - The cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin ST13BR, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, inhibits the growth of L. casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Based on tricine-SDS-PAGE, bacteriocin ST13BR is 10 kDa in size. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after treatment with Proteinase K, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. Low bacteriocin activity (200 AU/ml) was recorded in BHI medium, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. Maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded after 23 h in MRS broth, but only at 30 degrees C. Tween 80 in MRS broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. Meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in MRS broth, stimulated bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml). Only 50% activity (3,200 AU/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 AU/ml. Bacteriocin production was not stimulated by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 AU/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 AU/ml). Activity levels less than 200 AU/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. Maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. Maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. The presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher KH(2)PO(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - [In vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of Candida albicans].
AB  - The adherence of Candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and Escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of Candida albicans. The adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mM, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mM of sucrose, and 500 mM of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in Sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). The presence of other microorganisms, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas E. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
TI  - Patterns of cytokine induction by gram-positive and gram-negative probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria used in commercial probiotic preparations are most commonly gram-positive lactic acid-producing species, although there are also some probiotic products which utilise gram-negative coliform bacteria. Characterising how the innate immune system responds to these bacteria in vitro may give an indication as to the likely immunomodulatory events that can be triggered following probiotic administration in vivo. Here, an established gram-positive probiotic (Lactobacillus casei Shirota) was compared against a novel gram-negative probiotic strain (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917) for its ability to induce cytokine production in a cell type representative of the innate immune system; in addition, responses were contrasted against those induced by an enteropathogenic coliform, E. coli 2282. We investigated the ability of these three bacterial strains to modulate production of interleukins-10, -12 and -18; tumour necrosis factor-alpha; interferon-alpha; and transforming growth factor-beta, via a series of in vitro culture experiments involving the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line J774A.1. All bacteria induced marked secretion of IL-12 and TNFalpha by cells, while only coliforms induced production of IL-10; there was minimal or no induction of IL-18 or TGFbeta. Activation of cells with recombinant gamma-interferon promoted increased production of IL-12, but decreased production of IL-10, in response to the co-culture of coliform bacteria, indicating differential cytokine induction depending on the activation status of the target cell. In general, live bacteria stimulated higher levels of IL-10, IL-12 and TNFalpha secretion than heat-killed preparations, while only live coliforms induced IFNalpha. These findings are discussed in relation to the likely immunomodulatory effects of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria on the innate immune system in vivo, with particular emphasis on the marked similarity in cytokine response patterns observed between probiotic versus pathogenic coliform bacteria.
TI  - Agarose-coated anion exchanger prevents cell-adsorbent interactions.
AB  - A common problem during recovery of bioproducts by adsorption from particulate broths is fouling of the adsorbent material as a result of the interaction of cells and cell debris, which present negative charges, with the positively charged anion exchangers commonly used in bioprocesses. The effect of shielding an adsorbent with a layer of agarose on reducing the binding of cells while still allowing the low-molecular-mass bioproducts to be adsorbed was studied. Coating the anion-exchange resin Amberlite IRA-400 with agarose followed by cross-linking the agarose layer effectively prevented the binding of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Lactobacillus casei cells but allowed binding of lactic acid to the adsorbent. The cross-linked agarose layer was stable during recycling of the adsorbent.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous gene expression of a novel esterase from Lactobacillus casei CL96.
AB  - A novel esterase gene (estI) of Lactobacillus casei CL96 was localized on a 3.3-kb BamHI DNA fragment containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,800 bp. The ORF of estI was isolated by PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli, the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens, and the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under the control of T7, methanol dehydrogenase (P(mxaF)), and alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoters, respectively. The amino acid sequence of EstI indicated that the esterase is a novel member of the GHSMG family of lipolytic enzymes and that the enzyme contains a lipase-like catalytic triad, consisting of Ser325, Asp516, and His558. E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS containing estI expressed a novel 67.5-kDa protein corresponding to EstI in an N-terminal fusion with the S. tag peptide. The recombinant L. casei CL96 EstI protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity in a one-step affinity chromatography procedure on S-protein agarose. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 7.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Among the pNP (p-nitrophenyl) esters tested, the most selective substrate was pNP-caprylate (C(8)), with K(m) and k(cat) values of 14 +/- 1.08 microM and 1,245 +/- 42.3 S(-1), respectively.
TI  - Bacterial probiotic modulation of dendritic cells.
AB  - Intestinal dendritic cells are continually exposed to ingested microorganisms and high concentrations of endogenous bacterial flora. These cells can be activated by infectious agents and other stimuli to induce T-cell responses and to produce chemokines which recruit other cells to the local environment. Bacterial probiotics are of increasing use against intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. They act as nonpathogenic stimuli within the gut to regain immunologic quiescence. This study was designed to determine the ability of a bacterial probiotic cocktail VSL#3 to alter cell surface antigen expression and cytokine production in bone marrow-derived dendritic cell-enriched populations. Cell surface phenotype was monitored by monoclonal fluorescent antibody staining, and cytokine levels were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High-dose probiotic upregulated the expression of C80, CD86, CD40, and major histocompatibility complex class II I-Ad. Neither B7-DC or B7RP-1 was augmented after low-dose probiotic or Lactobacillus casei treatment, but B7RP-1 showed increased expression on dendritic cells stimulated with the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Functional studies showed that probiotic did not enhance the ability of dendritic cells to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation, as was observed for E. coli. Substantial enhancement of interleukin-10 release was observed in dendritic cell-enriched culture supernatants after 3 days of probiotic stimulation. These results demonstrate that probiotics possess the ability to modulate dendritic cell surface phenotype and cytokine release in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Regulation of dendritic cell cytokines by probiotics may contribute to the benefit of these molecules in treatment of intestinal diseases.
TI  - Probiotics induce resistance to enteropathogens in a re-nourished mouse model.
AB  - Nutritional deficiency is commonly associated with impaired immune response and the relation between infection and malnutrition is synergic. Probiotics, especially lactic acid bacteria are immunomodulatory. The aim was to determine whether optimal doses of Lactobacillus casei and yogurt, used as adjuvants in a re-nutrition diet in a non-severe malnutrition experimental model, protect against Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Groups of malnourished mice were used, which were re-nourished with milk for 7 or 14 d. After that, both groups of mice received the optimal doses of Lb. casei and yogurt supplements. We measured IgA+ and IgG+-B cells and phenotypic markers of T lymphocytes; CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells. We also determined alphabeta and gammabeta T cell receptor (TCR). The ability to protect against Sal. typhimurium and Esch. coli infections and specific S-IgA were assessed. Probiotics complemented the effects of the re-nutrition diet, by stimulating recuperation of the activity of immune cells that improved protection against infections.
TI  - Analysis, characterization, and loci of the tuf genes in lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species and their direct application for species identification.
AB  - We analyzed the tuf gene, encoding elongation factor Tu, from 33 strains representing 17 Lactobacillus species and 8 Bifidobacterium species. The tuf sequences were aligned and used to infer phylogenesis among species of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. We demonstrated that the synonymous substitution affecting this gene renders elongation factor Tu a reliable molecular clock for investigating evolutionary distances of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. In fact, the phylogeny generated by these tuf sequences is consistent with that derived from 16S rRNA analysis. The investigation of a multiple alignment of tuf sequences revealed regions conserved among strains belonging to the same species but distinct from those of other species. PCR primers complementary to these regions allowed species-specific identification of closely related species, such as Lactobacillus casei group members. These tuf gene-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to present methods for the identification for lactic acid bacterial species. Since a variable number of tuf genes have been described for bacteria, the presence of multiple genes was examined. Southern analysis revealed one tuf gene in the genomes of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, but the tuf gene was arranged differently in the genomes of these two taxa. Our results revealed that the tuf gene in bifidobacteria is flanked by the same gene constellation as the str operon, as originally reported for Escherichia coli. In contrast, bioinformatic and transcriptional analyses of the DNA region flanking the tuf gene in four Lactobacillus species indicated the same four-gene unit and suggested a novel tuf operon specific for the genus Lactobacillus.
TI  - Displacement of bacterial pathogens from mucus and Caco-2 cell surface by lactobacilli.
AB  - Competition, competitive exclusion and displacement of eight strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota from adhesion on human intestinal mucus glycoproteins and Caco-2 cell surfaces were studied. Lactobacilli were able to compete with, exclude and displace pathogenic gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria when they were incubated together, but the degree of inhibition of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. Competition and exclusion profiles of GI bacteria by lactobacilli were similar. Displacement profiles of GI bacteria were different from those of competition and exclusion and the process was relatively slow: displacement equilibrium took more than 2 h. These findings are important for development, selection and in vitro assessment of target- and function-specific probiotics.
TI  - Binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ECM) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECM molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. Porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. Strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota and L. johnsonii La1) as well as by L. casei L.c., Lactobacillus sp. 2I3 and by L. plantarum LP. The other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. Strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. Bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Some animal strains (at least L. casei L.c. and Lactobacillus sp. 2I3) are comparable with the commercially used strains with respect to their ECM binding ability. As this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.
TI  - Characterization of a theta-type plasmid from Lactobacillus sakei: a potential basis for low-copy-number vectors in lactobacilli.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the 13-kb plasmid pRV500, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei RV332, was determined. Sequence analysis enabled the identification of genes coding for a putative type I restriction-modification system, two genes coding for putative recombinases of the integrase family, and a region likely involved in replication. The structural features of this region, comprising a putative ori segment containing 11- and 22-bp repeats and a repA gene coding for a putative initiator protein, indicated that pRV500 belongs to the pUCL287 subfamily of theta-type replicons. A 3.7-kb fragment encompassing this region was fused to an Escherichia coli replicon to produce the shuttle vector pRV566 and was observed to be functional in L. sakei for plasmid replication. The L. sakei replicon alone could not support replication in E. coli. Plasmid pRV500 and its derivative pRV566 were determined to be at very low copy numbers in L. sakei. pRV566 was maintained at a reasonable rate over 20 generations in several lactobacilli, such as Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus plantarum, in addition to L. sakei, making it an interesting basis for developing vectors. Sequence relationships with other plasmids are described and discussed.
TI  - Moritella cold-active dihydrofolate reductase: are there natural limits to optimization of catalytic efficiency at low temperature?
AB  - Adapting metabolic enzymes of microorganisms to low temperature environments may  require a difficult compromise between velocity and affinity. We have investigated catalytic efficiency in a key metabolic enzyme (dihydrofolate reductase) of Moritella profunda sp. nov., a strictly psychrophilic bacterium with a maximal growth rate at 2 degrees C or less. The enzyme is monomeric (Mr=18,291), 55% identical to its Escherichia coli counterpart, and displays Tm and denaturation enthalpy changes much lower than E. coli and Thermotoga maritima homologues. Its stability curve indicates a maximum stability above the temperature range of the organism, and predicts cold denaturation below 0 degrees C. At mesophilic temperatures the apparent Km value for dihydrofolate is 50- to 80-fold higher than for E. coli, Lactobacillus casei, and T. maritima dihydrofolate reductases, whereas the apparent Km value for NADPH, though higher, remains in the same order of magnitude. At 5 degrees C these values are not significantly modified. The enzyme is also much less sensitive than its E. coli counterpart to the inhibitors methotrexate and trimethoprim. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with respect to dihydrofolate is thus much lower than in the other three bacteria. The higher affinity for NADPH could have been maintained by selection since NADPH assists the release of the product tetrahydrofolate. Dihydrofolate reductase adaptation to low temperature thus appears to have entailed a pronounced trade-off between affinity and catalytic velocity. The kinetic features of this psychrophilic protein suggest that enzyme adaptation to low temperature may be constrained by natural limits to optimization of catalytic efficiency.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  - There are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. In this study, Lactobacillus strains (L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. casei and L. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, C2BBe1. While the adhesion and colonization of EHEC was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of EHEC into the cell line was markedly suppressed by L. rhamnosus, though not by others. Concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of EHEC and host cell were not affected by the presence of L. rhamnosus. Simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on EHEC internalization was strictly dependent on viable L. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed L. rhamnosus. The fact that L. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between L. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of EHEC.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in Artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the Artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active constituents of the Artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides A and B by spectroscopic analysis. In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
TI  - Effects of nonpathogenic bacteria on cytokine secretion by human intestinal mucosa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The human intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem, and the mucosa is the interface between the immune system and the luminal environment. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether host-bacteria interactions influence mucosal cytokine production. METHODS: Macroscopically normal colonic specimens were obtained at surgery from eight patients with neoplasm, and inflamed ileal specimens were obtained from two patients with Crohn's disease. Mucosal explants were cultured for 24 h with either nonpathogenic Escherichia coli ECOR-26, Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001, L. casei DN-114 056, L. casei ATCC-334, or Lactobacillus bulgaricus LB-10. Each study included blank wells with no bacteria. Tissue and bacteria viability were confirmed by LDH release and culture. Concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, transforming growth factor beta1, interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-10 was measured in supernatants. In parallel experiments, neutralizing anti-TNFalpha antibody was added to the culture. RESULTS: Co-culture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release. Co-culture with L. casei strains significantly reduced TNFalpha release, whereas E. coli increased it. These effects were observed both in normal and inflamed mucosa. In combination studies, L. casei DN-114 001 prevented TNFalpha stimulation by E. coli. L. casei DN-114 001 also reduced IL-8 release via a TNFalpha-independent pathway. L. casei DN-114 056 or E. coli increased IL-10 release in the presence of neutralizing anti-TNFalpha. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpathogenic bacteria interact with human intestinal mucosa and can induce changes in cytokine production that are strain specific.
TI  - Sequence and analysis of pBM02, a novel RCR cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris P8-2-47.
AB  - This paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.85 kbp plasmid pBM02 from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris P8-2-47. Analysis of the sequence predicted six ORFs larger than 25 amino acids. They all were transcribed from the same strand and organized in two functional cassettes: the replication region and a putative mobilization region. In the replication region, two ORFs specifying proteins homologous to others found in some classes of rolling circle-replicating plasmids were encountered (copG and repB). In fact, single-stranded DNA was detected as a replication intermediate of pBM02. copG and repB, together with some upstream sequences, formed part of the minimal replication unit of the plasmid. Interestingly, pBM02 shared a 212 bp stretch with plasmids of the pWV01 type, in which the whole single-strand origin of replication is included. In the mobilization region, an ORF coding for a mobilization-like protein was present, preceded by a putative oriT sequence homologous to that of plasmid pMV158. The replicon of pBM02 is of the wide-host range type, and functions in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Crystal structure of HPr kinase/phosphatase from Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
AB  - HPr kinase/phosphatase (HPrK/P) modifies serine 46 of histidine-containing protein (HPr), the phosphorylation state of which is the control point of carbon catabolite repression in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria. To understand the structural mechanism by which HPrK/P carries out its dual, competing activities we determined the structure of full length HPrK/P from Mycoplasma pneumoniae (PD8 ID, 1KNX) to 2.5A resolution. The enzyme forms a homo-hexamer with each subunit containing two domains connected by a short loop. The C-terminal domain contains the well-described P-loop (Walker A box) ATP binding motif and takes a fold similar to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) from Escherichia coli as recently described in other HPrK/P structures. As expected, the C-terminal domain is very similar to the C-terminal fragment of Lactobacillus casei HPrK/P and the C-terminal domain of Staphylococcus xylosus HPrK/P; the N-terminal domain is very similar to the N-terminal domain of S.xylosus HPrK/P. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal domain resembles UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate:meso-diaminopimelate ligase (MurE), yet the function of this domain is unclear. We discuss these observations as well as the structural significance of mutations in the P-loop and HPrK/P family sequence motif.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in SOS-chromotest.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using SOS-Chromotest. The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes. Antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-NQO absorbance profile.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and biological activities of classical N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4-ethylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid and its 6-methyl derivative as potential dual inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase and as potential antitumor agents.
AB  - Two novel analogues, N-[2-amino-4-ethyl[(pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (2) and N-[2-amino-4-ethyl-6-methyl[(pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-l-glutam ic acid (4), were designed and synthesized as potent dual inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and as antitumor agents. Compound 2 had inhibitory potency against human DHFR similar to N-[4-[2-(amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L -glutamic acid (LY231514) and 1, whereas 4 was inactive against human DHFR. Both 2 and 4 were more potent than LY231514 against E. coliTS. Against human TS, 2 was 7-fold less potent than LY231514 and 4 showed similar inhibitory activity as LY231514. In contrast to 2, which was an efficient substrate of human folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), 4 was a poor substrate of FPGS. Compound 2 showed GI50 values in the nanomolar range against more than 18 human tumor cell lines in the standard NCI preclinical in vitro screen.
TI  - Effect of frequent consumption of a Lactobacillus casei-containing milk drink in  Helicobacter pylori-colonized subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported inhibitory effects of lactic acid bacteria on bacterial pathogens. AIM: To test whether a drink containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota inhibits Helicobacter pylori growth. METHODS: The in vitro growth inhibition of H. pylori was studied when L. casei was added to plates previously inoculated with H. pylori reference strain NCTC 11637. In an intervention study, 14 H. pylori-positive subjects were given Yakult drink (10(8) colony-forming units/mL L. casei) thrice daily during meals for 3 weeks. Six untreated H. pylori-positive subjects served as controls. H. pylori bacterial loads were determined using the 13C-urea breath test, which was performed before and 3 weeks after the start of L. casei supplementation. RESULTS: In vitro, L. casei inhibits H. pylori growth. This effect was stronger with L. casei grown in milk solution than in DeMan-Rogosa-Sharpe medium. No growth inhibition was shown with medium inoculated with lactic acid, Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha or uninoculated medium. Filtration of L. casei culture before incubation with H. pylori completely abolished the inhibitory effect. Urease activity decreased in nine of the 14 (64%) subjects with L. casei supplementation and in two of the six (33%) controls (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Viable L. casei are required for H. pylori growth inhibition. This does not result from changes in lactic acid concentration. In addition, a slight, but non-significant, trend towards a suppressive effect of L. casei on H. pylori in vivo may exist.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the S-layer protein crystallisation domain  of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: evidence for protein-protein interaction of two subdomains.
AB  - The structure of the crystallisation domain, SAN, of the S(A)-protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was analysed by insertion and deletion mutagenesis, and by proteolytic treatment. Mutant S(A)-protein synthesised in Escherichia coli with 7-13 amino acid insertions near the N terminus or within regions of sequence variation in SAN (amino acid position 7, 45, 114, 125, 193), or in the cell wall-binding domain (position 345) could form crystalline sheets, whereas insertions in conserved regions or in regions with predicted secondary structure elements (positions 30, 67, 88 and 156) destroyed this capacity. FACscan analysis of L.acidophilus synthesising three crystallising and one non-crystallising S(A)-protein c-myc (19 amino acid residues) insertion mutant was performed with c-myc antibodies. Fluorescence was most pronounced for insertions at positions 125 and 156, less for position 45 and severely reduced for position 7. By cytometric flow sorting a transformant harbouring the mutant S(A)-protein gene (position 125) was isolated that showed an increased fluorescense signal. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that the transformant synthesized mutant S(A)-protein only. PCR analysis of the transformant grown in the absence of selection pressure indicated that the mutant allele was stably integrated in the chromosome. Proteolytic treatment of S(A)-protein indicated that only sites near the middle of SAN are susceptible, although potential cleavage sites are present through the entire molecule. Expression in E.coli of DNA sequences encoding the two halves of SAN yielded peptides that could oligomerize. Our results indicate that SAN consists of a approximately 12kDa N and a approximately 18kDa C-terminal subdomain linked by a surface exposed loop. The capacity of S(A)-protein of L.acidophilus to present epitopes, up to approximately 19 amino acid residues in length, at the bacterial surface in a genetically stable form, makes the system, in principle, suitable for application as an oral delivery vehicle.
TI  - The effect of Arg209 to Lys mutation in mouse thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Mouse thymidylate synthase R209K (a mutation corresponding to R218K in Lactobacillus casei), overexpressed in thymidylate synthase-deficient Escherichia coli strain, was poorly soluble and with only feeble enzyme activity. The mutated protein, incubated with FdUMP and N(5,10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate, did not form a complex stable under conditions of SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The reaction catalyzed by the R209K enzyme (studied in a crude extract), compared to that catalyzed by purified wild-type recombinant mouse thymidylate synthase, showed the K(m) value for dUMP 571-fold higher and V(max) value over 50-fold (assuming that the mutated enzyme constituted 20% of total crude extract protein) lower. Thus the ratios k(cat, R209K)/k(cat, 'wild') and (k(cat, R209K)/K(m, R209K)(dUMP))/( k(cat, 'wild')/K(m, 'wild')(dUMP)) were 0.019 and 0.000032, respectively, documenting that mouse thymidylate synthase R209, similar to the corresponding L. casei R218, is essential for both dUMP binding and enzyme reaction.
TI  - Domains in the S-layer protein CbsA of Lactobacillus crispatus involved in adherence to collagens, laminin and lipoteichoic acids and in self-assembly.
AB  - The protein regions in the S-layer protein CbsA of Lactobacillus crispatus JCM 5810, needed for binding to collagens and laminin, anchoring to bacterial cell wall, as well as self-assembly, were mapped by deletion analysis of His-tagged peptides isolated from Escherichia coli and by heterologous expression on Lactobacillus casei. Mature CbsA is 410 amino acids long, and stepwise genetic truncation at both termini revealed that the region 32-271 carries the infor-mation for self-assembly of CbsA into a periodic structure. The lactobacillar S-layer proteins exhibit sequence variation in their assembly domain, but the border regions 30-34 and 269-274 in CbsA are conserved in valine-rich short sequences. Short deletions or substitutions at these regions affected the morphology of His-CbsA polymers, which varied from sheet-like to cylindrical tubular polymers, and further truncation beyond the DNA encoding residues 32 and 271 leads to a non-periodic aggregation. The self-assembly of the truncated peptides, as seen by electron microscopy, was correlated with their behaviour in a cross-linking study. The shorter peptides not forming a regular polymer were observed by the cross-linking study and mass spectrometry to form dimers, trimers and tetramers, whereas the other peptides were cross-linked to large multimers only. Binding of solubilized type I and IV collagens was observed with the His-CbsA peptides 1-274 and 31-287, but not with the smaller peptides regardless of their ability to form regular polymers. Strain JCM 5810 also adheres to immobilized laminin and, in order to analyse the possible laminin binding by CbsA, cbsA and its fragments were expressed on the surface of L. casei. Expression of the CbsA peptides 1-274, 1-287, 28-287 and 31-287 on L. casei conferred adhesiveness to both laminin and collagen immobilized on glass as well as to laminin- and collagen-containing regions in chicken colon and ileum. The C-terminal peptides 251-410 and 288-410 bound to L. crispatus JCM 5810 cells from which the S-layer had been depleted by chemical extraction, whereas no binding was seen with the His-CbsA peptides 1-250 or 1-269 or to cells with an intact S-layer. The His-CbsA peptides 251-410 and 288-410 bound to teichoic acids of several bacterial species. The results show that CbsA is an adhesive complex with an N-terminal assembly domain exhibiting affinity for pericellular tissue components and a cationic C-terminal domain binding to negatively charged cell wall components.
TI  - Increased mucosal tumour necrosis factor alpha production in Crohn's disease can  be downregulated ex vivo by probiotic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. The effect of bacteria on TNF-alpha release by intestinal mucosa was investigated. METHODS: Ileal specimens were obtained at surgery from 10 patients with Crohn's disease (ileal stricture) and five disease controls undergoing right hemicolectomy (caecal cancer). Mucosal explants from each specimen were cultured for 24 hours with either non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, L bulgaricus LB10, or L crispatus (each study contained blank wells with no bacteria). Tissue and bacterial viability was confirmed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and culture. Concentrations of TNF-alpha were measured in supernatants and the phenotype of the intestinal lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Coculture of mucosa with bacteria did not modify LDH release. Release of TNF-alpha by inflamed Crohn's disease mucosa was significantly reduced by coculture with L casei or L bulgaricus; changes induced by L crispatus or E coli were not significant. The effect of L casei and L bulgaricus was not prevented by protease inhibitors. Coculture with L casei and L bulgaricus reduced the number of CD4 cells as well as TNF-alpha expression among intraepithelial lymphocytes from Crohn's disease mucosa. None of the bacteria induced changes in non-inflamed mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics interact with immunocompetent cells using the mucosal interface and modulate locally the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Competition for adhesion between probiotics and human gastrointestinal pathogens  in the presence of carbohydrate.
AB  - The adhesion of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells  was not inhibited by eight carbohydrates tested, namely N-acetyl-glucosamine, galactose, glucose, fructose, fucose, mannose, methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and sucrose. The degree of hydrophobicity predicted the adhesion of L. rhamnosus GG to Caco-2 cells. L. rhamnosus GG, however, was able to compete with Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. of low hydrophobicity and high adhesin-receptor interaction for adhesion to Caco-2 cells. The interference of adhesion of these gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria by L. rhamnosus GG was probably through steric hindrance, and the degree of inhibition was related to the distribution of the adhesin receptors and hydrophobins on the Caco-2 surface. A Carbohydrate Index for Adhesion (CIA) was used to depict the binding property of adhesins on bacteria surfaces. CIA was defined as the sum of the fraction of adhesion in the presence of carbohydrates, with reference to the adhesion measured in the absence of any carbohydrate. The degree of competition for receptor sites between Lactobacillus casei Shirota and GI bacteria is a function of their CIA distance. There were at least two types of adhesins on the surface of L. casei Shirota. The study provides a scientific basis for the screening and selection of probiotics that compete with selective groups of pathogens for adhesion to intestinal surfaces. It also provides a model for the characterisation of adhesins and adhesin-receptor interactions.
TI  - Synthesis of cholera toxin B subunit gene: cloning and expression of a functional 6XHis-tagged protein in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) has been extensively studied as immunogen, adjuvant, and oral tolerance inductor depending on the antigen conjugated or coadministered. It has been already expressed in several bacterial and yeast systems. In this study, we synthesized a versatile gene coding a 6XHis-tagged CTB (359bp). The sequence was designed according to codon usage of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, and Salmonella typhimurium. The gene assembly was based on a polymerase chain reaction, in which the polymerase extends DNA fragments from a pool of overlapping oligonucleotides. The synthetic gene was amplified, cloned, and expressed in E. coli in an insoluble form, reaching levels about 13 mg of purified active pentameric rCTB per liter of induced culture. Western blot and ELISA analyses showed that recombinant CTB is strongly and specifically recognized by polyclonal antibodies against the cholera toxin. The ability to form the functional pentamers was observed in cell culture by the inhibition of cholera toxin activity on Y1 adrenal cells in the presence of recombinant CTB. The 6XHis-tagged CTB provides a simple way to obtain functional CTB through Ni(2+)-charged resin after refolding and also free of possible CTA contaminants as in the case of CTB obtained from Vibrio cholerae cultures.
TI  - Structural features of the lac promoter affecting gusA expression in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - With the aim of designing efficient expression systems for Lactobacillus casei, different factors affecting gene expression from the strong and highly modulated lac promoter have been systematically analyzed, by using the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene (gusA) as reporter. The activity of this enzyme (GUS) was quantified when plac:: gusA fusions were cloned in plasmids with different copy number or when gusA was inserted in the chromosomal lactose operon (single copy). Results showed a clear gene dosage effect and a positive influence of the native lac operon transcription and translation signals on GUS expression.
TI  - Inducible promoter-repressor system from the Lactobacillus casei phage phiFSW.
AB  - With the aim to extend the presently available inducible gene expression systems  for lactobacilli, we have isolated a thermoinducible promoter-repressor cassette from the temperate Lactobacillus casei phage phiFSW-TI in Escherichia coli. The phiFSW-TI promoter fragment was abutted to the plasmid-borne promoterless beta-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter gene and shown to direct its transcription in L. casei. In addition, the functionality of the promoter-repressor system was verified in the L. casei phiFSW-TI lysogen by showing that the gusA reporter gene, controlled by the isolated phiFSW-TI promoter, was repressed at 28 degrees C and expressed at 42 degrees C. Moreover, a homology search revealed that the C terminus of the isolated phiFSW repressor shows a high similarity to the small mutS-related domain of the MutS2 protein family that is unprecedented for phage-encoded repressor proteins.
TI  - Structure-based studies on species-specific inhibition of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy. Due to its key role in the sole de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is an essential enzyme in all life forms. As such, it has been recently recognized as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. There is also a pressing need for new antimicrobial agents that are able to target strains that are drug resistant toward currently used drugs. In this context, species specificity is of crucial importance to distinguish between the invading microorganism and the human host, yet thymidylate synthase is among the most highly conserved enzymes. We combine structure-based drug design with rapid synthetic techniques and mutagenesis, in an iterative fashion, to develop novel antifolates that are not derived from the substrate and cofactor, and to understand the molecular basis for the observed species specificity. The role of structural and computational studies in the discovery of nonanalog antifolate inhibitors of bacterial TS, naphthalein and dansyl derivatives, and in the understanding of their biological activity profile, are discussed.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Mutation of an essential glutamate residue in folylpolyglutamate synthetase and activation of the enzyme by pteroate binding.
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on Glu143, an essential amino acid in Lactobacillus casei folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) and the structurally equivalent residue, Glu146, in Escherichia coli FPGS. Glu143 is positioned near the P-loop and interacts with the Mg(2+) of Mg NTP-binding proteins. We have solved the structure of the E143A mutant of L. casei FPGS in the presence of AMPPCP and Mg(2+). The structure showed a water molecule at the place where Mg(2+) bound to the wild type enzyme. Mutant proteins E143A, and even E143D and E143Q with conservative mutations, lacked enzyme activity and failed to complement the methionine auxotrophy of the E. coli folC mutant SF4, showing that Glu143 is an essential residue. Both the L. casei and the E. coli FPGS mutant proteins bound methylene-tetrahydrofolate diglutamate and dihydropteroate normally. The E. coli E146Q mutant FPGS bound ADP with the same affinity as the wild type enzyme but bound ATP with much lower affinity and had higher ATPase activity than the wild type enzyme. The mutant enzyme was defective in forming the acyl-phosphate reaction intermediate from ATP and dihydropteroate. The E. coli FPGS requires activation by dihydropteroate or tetrahydrofolate binding to allow full activity. In the absence of a pteroate substrate, only 30% of the total enzyme binds ATP. We suggest that dihydropteroate causes a conformational change to allow increased ATP binding. The mutant enzyme was similarly activated by dihydropteroate resulting in increased ADP binding.
TI  - Mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and Gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether enterobacteria and Gram-positive bacterial cell walls (BCW) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) were isolatedfrom patients with early RA (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). The mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) responses to heat-killed Salmonella enteritidis (SE). Yersinia enterocolitica (YE), and Escherichia coli (EC), and to Gram-positive BCW derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, Eubacterium aerofaciens (EA), Eubacterium limosum (EL), Lactobacillus casei (LC), and Lactobacillus fermentum (LF), and a BCW derived from a pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes (SP) were investigated. RESULTS: 39% or 56% of patients with early RA showed significant proliferation responses by PBMC or SFMC against enterobacteria, respectively. In other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. When BCW were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early RA showed proliferation responses by PBMC or SFMC, respectively. In other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. However, TNF-alpha production by SFMC stimulated by EA BCW, SE, YE or EC, was significantly higher in early RA than in other types of arthritis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SFMC reacting with enterobacteria or BCW exist in some patients with early RA, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. Intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of RA, but the effect appears to be non-specific.
TI  - Reduction of sulfide, ammonia compounds, and adhesion properties of Lactobacillus casei strain KE99 in vitro.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus casei strain KE99 to reduce sulfide, ammonia, and to adhere to bio-surfaces was characterized and compared with three lactobacillus reference strains. Sulfide reduction by strain KE99 in MRS broth increased exponentially after 10-h growth and reached a maximum (>300 ppm reduction) within 48 h. KE99 demonstrated a maximum reduction of sulfide under anaerobic (341 ppm) growth conditions at pH 6.0-8.0 range. Maximum anaerobic reduction of sulfide was demonstrated by L. casei 393 at pH 7.0 (272 ppm); L. rhamnosus at pH 8.0 (277 ppm); and L. reuteri at pH 7.0 (244 ppm). KE99 reduced sulfide more (p < 0.0001) in MRS broth spiked with Na2S (374 ppm) than (NH4)2S (340 ppm) salts. Ammonia reduction by strain KE99 and the three lactobacillus reference strains in MRS broth was low. Ammonia reduction reached a maximum within 36 h and remained unchanged over extended incubations of 48 h to 72 h or further. KE99 reduced ammonium sulfate (37 ppm) more readily than the nitrate (31 ppm), hypophosphate (29 ppm), or chloride (20 ppm) salts of ammonia. KE99 and the three reference strains of lactobacilli demonstrated avid binding to Bio-coat (Cn type-I, Cn type-IV, laminin, fibronectin), Matrigel, and Caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. The number of lactobacilli binding to Caco-2 was estimated at 74/cell with strain KE99, which was significantly higher compared with 40/cell (p < 0.0001), 26/cell (0.0001), and 64/cell (p < 0.002) with L. casei 393, L. reuteri, and L. rhamnosus, respectively. The interaction of KE99 to immobilized Cn type-I was saturable and reached an equilibrium within 1 h at room temperature. KE99 binding to Cn type-I occurred at a wide pH range and was biphasic with maximum binding at pH 5.5 and 7.5. Inhibition and binding-displacement experiments with different salts and sugars suggested that the KE99 binding to immobilized Cn type-I may involve a combination of electrostatic and lectin-type interactions. KE99 effectively detached the Cn-adherent E. coli O157:H7 in the range of 55% (ATCC43895) to 76% (ATCC43894). The binding-displacement values for L. casei 393, L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus to detach Cn-adherent E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC43894) were 66 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 2%, and 64 +/- 2%, respectively. Also, a reconstituted solution of the freeze-dried KE99 preparation effectively detached the Cn-adherent E. coli O157:H7 in a dose-dependent manner that reached a binding-displacement equilibrium of 85% at a 1% wt/vol KE99 concentration.
TI  - Highly divergent dihydrofolate reductases conserve complex folding mechanisms.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that protein folding mechanisms are better conserved than  amino acid sequences, the mechanisms for dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) from human (hs), Escherichia coli (ec) and Lactobacillus casei (lc) were elucidated and compared using intrinsic Trp fluorescence and fluorescence-detected 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) binding. The development of the native state was monitored using either methotrexate (absorbance at 380 nm) or NADPH (extrinsic fluorescence) binding. All three homologs displayed complex unfolding and refolding kinetic mechanisms that involved partially folded states and multiple energy barriers. Although the pairwise sequence identities are less than 30 %, folding to the native state occurs via parallel folding channels and involves two types of on-pathway kinetic intermediates for all three homologs. The first ensemble of kinetic intermediates, detected within a few milliseconds, has significant secondary structure and exposed hydrophobic cores. The second ensemble is obligatory and has native-like side-chain packing in a hydrophobic core; however, these intermediates are unable to bind active-site ligands. The formation of the ensemble of native states occurs via three channels for hsDHFR, and four channels for lcDHFR and ecDHFR. The binding of active-site ligands (methotrexate and NADPH) accompanies the rate-limiting formation of the native ensemble. The conservation of the fast, intermediate and slow-folding events for this complex alpha/beta motif provides convincing evidence for the hypothesis that evolutionarily related proteins achieve the same fold via similar pathways.
TI  - Construction of compatible wide-host-range shuttle vectors for lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - A new collection of shuttle cloning vectors has been constructed that can be used in a broad host range, because they carry replication origins which are functional in Escherichia coli (p15A, pWV01, ColE1), Lactococcus lactis, lactobacilli, and Bacillus subtilis (pAMbeta1, pWV01). These plasmids contain the lacZ-T1T2 cassette from pJDC9, which allows the X-gal selection and cloning of DNA fragments that could cause plasmid instability in E. coli. In addition, they have been proved to be structurally and segregationally stable in Lactobacillus casei, in which their copy number has been determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the antibiotic resistance markers (beta-lactamase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, and erythromycin transacetylase) and the theta and rolling circle replicating origins have been combined to obtain this set of compatible plasmids (pIA family) that can be cotransformed, both in lactic acid bacteria and in E. coli.
TI  - Predicting and harnessing protein flexibility in the design of species-specific inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein plasticity in response to ligand binding abrogates the notion of a rigid receptor site. Thus, computational docking alone misses important prospective drug design leads. Bacterial-specific inhibitors of an essential enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS), were developed using a combination of computer-based screening followed by in-parallel synthetic elaboration and enzyme assay [Tondi et al. (1999) Chem. Biol. 6, 319-331]. Specificity was achieved through protein plasticity and despite the very high sequence conservation of the enzyme between species. RESULTS: The most potent of the inhibitors synthesized, N,O-didansyl-L-tyrosine (DDT), binds to Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) with 35-fold higher affinity and to Escherichia coli TS (EcTS) with 24-fold higher affinity than to human TS (hTS). To reveal the molecular basis for this specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of EcTS complexed with DDT and 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP). The 2.0 A structure shows that DDT binds to EcTS in a conformation not predicted by molecular docking studies and substantially differently than other TS inhibitors. Binding of DDT is accompanied by large rearrangements of the protein both near and distal to the enzyme's active site with movement of C alpha carbons up to 6 A relative to other ternary complexes. This protein plasticity results in novel interactions with DDT including the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to residues conserved in bacterial TS but not hTS and which are hypothesized to account for DDT's specificity. The conformation DDT adopts when bound to EcTS explains the activity of several other LcTS inhibitors synthesized in-parallel with DDT suggesting that DDT binds to the two enzymes in similar orientations. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic protein rearrangements involving both main and side chain atoms play an important role in the recognition of DDT by EcTS and highlight the importance of incorporating protein plasticity in drug design. The crystal structure of the EcTS/dUMP/DDT complex is a model system to develop more selective TS inhibitors aimed at pathogenic bacterial species. The crystal structure also suggests a general formula for identifying regions of TS and other enzymes that may be treated as flexible to aid in computational methods of drug discovery.
TI  - Inhibition of in vitro growth of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 by probiotic Lactobacillus strains due to production of lactic acid.
AB  - The inhibiting characteristics of lactic acid bacteria on Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 (three strains, clinically isolated) was investigated by using a batch fermentation system. The species such as Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota or L. acidophilus YIT 0070 exert growth inhibitory and bactericidal activities on STEC. The pH value and undissociated lactic acid (U-LA) concentration of the culture medium of STEC cocultured with L. casei or L. acidophilus dramatically lowered or increased, respectively [corrected], when compared with those of the control culture. The cytotoxic properties of U-LA on STEC strain 89020087 analyzed in vitro was divided into two phases, i.e., the bacteriostatic phase (between 3.2 to 62 mM) and the bactericidal phase (over 62 mM). These data suggest that the bactericidal effect of Lactobacillus on STEC depends on its lactic acid production and pH reductive effect.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on enterocyte bacterial translocation in vitro.
AB  - Enteral probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG (LGG) have been used in the treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including diarrhea, malabsorption, and Clostridium difficile colitis. We have previously demonstrated that the probiotic bacterium LGG has an inhibitory effect on bacterial translocation (BT) in a neonatal rabbit model. However, this in-vivo model is limited for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for probiotic inhibition of BT. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of LGG in reducing the rate of Escherichia coli C25 (E. coli C25) translocation using an in-vitro enterocyte cell-culture model. Human colonic carcinoma (Caco-2) enterocytes were seeded in porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system and grown for 14 days to confluence. The monolayers were incubated at 37 degrees C with LGG for 180 min. Non-adherent LGG was washed away prior to a 120-min incubation period with 10(5) CFU E. coli C25. E. coli that had translocated across the enterocyte monolayer were quantified by growing basal-chamber media samples on gram-negative bacteria-specific MacConkey's agar. In order to determine monolayer integrity, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured across Caco-2 cells treated with LGG and E. coli. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA with P < 0.05 considered significant. LGG inhibited E. coli translocation at all LGG concentrations tested. The TEER ratio was not significantly altered by addition of LGG or E. coli (0.9 +/- 0.03 vs 0.8 +/- 0.05). These results demonstrate that the probiotic bacterium LGG inhibits BT of E. coli C25 in a dose-dependent manner in an in-vitro cell-culture model. This model should be valuable in investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of pathological enteral bacteria by probiotic agents.
TI  - The effect of oral bacteria on Candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  - A total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral Candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. Briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a C. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive Candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. In general, out of eight bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis SK21A, Streptococcus salivarius SK56, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and S. salivarius OBU3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different C albicans isolates. Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg 50, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 and Prevotella intermedia OBU4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas S. sanguis OBU 2 had no effect. E. coli ATCC 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). A significant increase in the germ tube production of C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected compared with HIV-free individuals was also noted. The current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of C. albicans isolates.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic Lactobacillus casei in a murine model of Escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against Escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model was examined. UTI was induced by intraurethral administration of Escherichia coli strain HU-1 (a clinical isolate from a UTI patient, positive for type 1 and P fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) CFU in 20 microl of saline, into a C3H/HeN mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 N HCl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 N NaOH 24 h before the challenge infection. Chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) CFU in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. A single administration of L. casei Shirota at a dose of 10(8) CFU 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited E. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. Multiple daily treatments with L. casei Shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity in this UTI model. A heat-killed preparation of L. casei Shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. The other Lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., L. fermentum ATCC 14931(T), L. jensenii ATCC 25258(T), L. plantarum ATCC 14917(T), and L. reuteri JCM 1112(T), had no significant antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic L. casei strain Shirota is a potent therapeutic agent for UTI.
TI  - Probiotic activities of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - The interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. In this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) were investigated. Using intestinal Caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. The inhibitory effects of Lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. A decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with Lcr35. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of cell-free Lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, ETEC, EPEC, K. pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile. The growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. Together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
TI  - Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) as a tool for identification of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus zeae and Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - AIMS: To develop a tool for rapid and inexpensive identification of the Lactobacillus casei complex. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus zeae and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were identified by PCR-amplification of the segment between the U1 and U2 regions of 16S rDNA (position 8-357, Escherichia coli numbering) and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Seven tested Lact. paracasei strains were divided into three TTGE-subgroups. CONCLUSION: TTGE successfully distinguished between the closely-related target species. TTGE is also a powerful method for revealing sequence heterogeneities in the 16S rRNA genes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Due to rapid and easy performance, TTGE of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA fragments will be useful for the identification of extended numbers of isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  - Endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located in confined areas of the root canal system. The antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT, Grossman's Sealer, ThermaSeal, Sealer 26, AH Plus, and Sealer Plus. The agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. In the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. The diameters of the formed discs were recorded. All root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. There were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). All root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that AH Plus and Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.
TI  - Reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the US. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. We studied the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium and a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. Following oral inoculation with 10(10)CFU of E. coli O157:H7, 30 Suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. The lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with L. acidophilus or with S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum. The microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)CFU per kilogram of diet. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) as a selective media. E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by its reaction with O157 and H7 antisera. E. coli O157:H7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. However, lambs administered a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum shed significantly lower (P=0.0211) average number of E. coli O157:H7 (2.3log(10)CFU per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. S. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (P=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of L. acidophulus and S. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)CFU per gram of feces) but significantly lower (P=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)CFU per gram of feces) and those supplemented with L. acidophilus (5.5log(10)CFU per gram of feces). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were significantly improved (P=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for L. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for S. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for L. acidophulus and S. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum supplemented lambs. The study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with E. coli O157:H7 with S. faecium or a mixture of S. faecium, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of E. coli O157:H7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.
TI  - Protective effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota on Shiga toxin-producing  Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in infant rabbits.
AB  - We examined colonization patterns of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), concentrations of Shiga toxins (Stxs) and specific immunoglobulin A (lgA) against Stxs and STEC bacterial cell surface antigen in various portions of the gastrointestinal tract in an infant rabbit infection model. After inoculation of 3-day-old infant rabbits with STEC strain 89020087 at low doses (approximately 10(3) CFU/body), numbers of colonizing STEC bacteria and concentrations of Stxs in the intestine increased dramatically and the animals developed diarrhea within a couple of days after infection. Daily administration of Lactobacillus casei from the day of birth dramatically decreased the severity of diarrhea and lowered STEC colonization levels in the gastrointestinal tract 100-fold day 7 after infection. Both Stx1 and Stx2 concentrations in the intestines and histological damage to the intestinal mucus induced by STEC infection were decreased by the administration of L. casei. Examination of the concentrations of volatile fatty acids and pH of the intestinal contents revealed that the protective effect of L. casei administration against STEC infection was not due to fermented products such as lactic acid in the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of L. casei increased levels of lgAs against Stx1, Stx2, and formalin-killed STEC cells in the colon approximately two-, four-, and threefold, respectively, compared with those of the untreated controls by day 7 after infection. These results suggest that administration of L. casei strain Shirota enhances the local immune responses to STEC cells and Stxs and leads to elimination of STEC and thus decreases Stx concentrations in the intestines.
TI  - The S-layer protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for S-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (S(A)-protein) of 43 kDa. S(A)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. Reconstruction of the S-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 A; b=53 A, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the S-layer of Lactobacillus helveticus ATCC 12046. Sequence comparison of S(A)-protein with S-proteins from L. helveticus, Lactobacillus crispatus and the S-proteins encoded by the silent S-protein genes from L. acidophilus and L. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the N-terminal two-thirds (SAN), and another made up of the C-terminal one-third (SAC) of S(A)-protein. The sequence of the N-terminal domains is variable, while that of the C-terminal domain is highly conserved in the S-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. Proteolytic digestion of S(A)-protein showed that SAN was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. SAC was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. DNA sequences encoding SAN or Green Fluorescent Protein fused to SAC (GFP-SAC) were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified SAN could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic S(A)-protein. A calculated S(A)-protein minus SAN density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the SAC domain, which is missing from the truncated SAN peptide. The GFP-SAC fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of L. acidophilus, L. helveticus and L. crispatus cells from which the S-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped cells or to Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - YeiL, the third member of the CRP-FNR family in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The yeiL open reading frame located at 48.5 min (2254 kb) in the nfo-fruA region  of the Escherichia coli chromosome was predicted to encode a CRP and FNR paralogue capable of forming inter- or intra-molecular disulphide bonds and incorporating one iron-sulphur centre per 25 kDa subunit. Purified MBP-YeiL (a maltose-binding-protein-YeiL fusion protein) was a high-molecular-mass oligomer or aggregate which released unstable monomers (68 kDa) under reducing conditions. The MBP-YeiL protein contained substoichiometric amounts of iron and acid-labile sulphide, and an average of one disulphide bond per monomer. The iron and sulphide contents increased consistent with the acquisition of one [4Fe-4S] cluster per monomer after anaerobic NifS-catalysed reconstitution. By analogy with FNR and FLP (the FNR-like protein of Lactobacillus casei) it was suggested that the transcription-regulatory activity of YeiL might be modulated by a sensory iron-sulphur cluster and/or by reversible disulphide bond formation. A yeiL-lacZ transcriptional fusion showed that aerobic yeiL expression increases at least sixfold during stationary phase, requires RpoS, and is positively autoregulated by YeiL, positively activated by Lrp (and IHF in the absence of FNR) and negatively regulated by FNR. A regulatory link between the synthesis of YeiK (a potential nucleoside hydrolase) and YeiL was inferred by showing that the yeiK and yeiL genes are divergently transcribed from overlapping promoters. A 10-15% deficiency in aerobic growth yield and an enhanced loss of viability under nitrogen starvation conditions were detected with a yeiL::kan(R) mutant, suggesting that YeiL might function as a post-exponential-phase nitrogen-starvation regulator.
TI  - Integrative food-grade expression system based on the lactose regulon of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The lactose operon from Lactobacillus casei is regulated by very tight glucose repression and substrate induction mechanisms, which made it a tempting candidate system for the expression of foreign genes or metabolic engineering. An integrative vector was constructed, allowing stable gene insertion in the chromosomal lactose operon of L. casei. This vector was based on the nonreplicative plasmid pRV300 and contained two DNA fragments corresponding to the 3' end of lacG and the complete lacF gene. Four unique restriction sites were created, as well as a ribosome binding site that would allow the cloning and expression of new genes between these two fragments. Then, integration of the cloned genes into the lactose operon of L. casei could be achieved via homologous recombination in a process that involved two selection steps, which yielded highly stable food-grade mutants. This procedure has been successfully used for the expression of the E. coli gusA gene and the L. lactis ilvBN genes in L. casei. Following the same expression pattern as that for the lactose genes, beta-glucuronidase activity and diacetyl production were repressed by glucose and induced by lactose. This integrative vector represents a useful tool for strain improvement in L. casei that could be applied to engineering fermentation processes or used for expression of genes for clinical and veterinary uses.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and X-ray crystal structure of a potent dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase as an antitumor agent.
AB  - A novel N- inverted question mark2-amino-4-methyl[(pyrrolo[2, 3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl inverted question mark-L-glutamic acid (3a) was designed and synthesized as a potent dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and as an antitumor agent. Compound 3b, the N7-benzylated analogue of 3a, was also synthesized as an antitumor agent. The synthesis of 3a was accomplished via a 12-step sequence which involved the synthesis of 2-amino-4-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (10) in 5 steps from 2-acetylbutyrolactone. Protection of the 2-amino group of 10 and regioselective iodination at the 5-position followed by palladium-catalyzed coupling afforded intermediate 14 which was converted to 3a by reduction and saponification. Similar synthetic methodology was used for 3b. X-ray crystal structure of the ternary complex of 3a, DHFR, and NADPH showed that the pyrrolo[2, 3-d]pyrimidine ring binds in a "2,4-diamino mode" in which the pyrrole nitrogen mimics the 4-amino moiety of 2,4-diaminopyrimidines. This is the first example of a classical pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolate shown to have this alternate mode of binding to DHFR. Compounds 3a and 3b were more inhibitory than LY231514 against TS from Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli. Analogue 3a was also more inhibitory against DHFR from human, Toxoplasma gondii, and Pneumocystis carinii. Evaluation of 3a against methotrexate (MTX)-resistant cell lines with defined mechanisms indicated that cross-resistance of 3a was much lower than that of MTX. Metabolite protection studies and folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase studies suggest that the antitumor activity of 3a against the growth of tumor cells in culture is a result of dual inhibition of TS and DHFR. Compound 3a inhibited the growth of CCRF-CEM and FaDu cells in culture at ED(50) values of 12.5 and 7.0 nM, respectively, and was more active against FaDu cells than MTX. In contrast, compound 3b was inactive against both cell lines. Compound 3a was evaluated in the National Cancer Institute in vitro preclinical antitumor screening program and afforded IG(50) values in the nanomolar range against a number of tumor cell lines.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of Lactobacillus casei phage PL-1 lysis genes.
AB  - The genes encoding the host cell wall-lytic proteins were searched in the genome  DNA of phage PL-1 active against Lactobacillus casei ATCC 27092 by comparing the amino acid sequences with those of others using a computer software of the DDBJ data base. The gene regions found were cloned into E. coli by inserting PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the EcoRI site of pUC 19, and the nucleotide sequences were determined. One of the ORFs (hol) consisted of 270 bp encoding 90 amino acids. The hol product (holin) possessed a putative secretion signal, two putative transmembrane helices, and a highly charged C-terminus. Another ORF (lys) consisted of 1050 bp encoding an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase of 350 amino acids. The gene lys was expressed in E. coli using pCALn expression vector, and the purified gene product hydrolysed the amide linkage in the peptidoglycans of L. casei. The amino acid sequence of PL-1 amidase showed a high homology to those of Lactococcus lactis phage rlt and Listeria monocytogenes phage A511. It was suggested that the N-terminal region was involved in enzyme activity and the C-terminal region in binding the enzyme to the cell wall substrate, respectively.
TI  - Development of a chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal system for Lactobacillus acidophilus with thyA gene as selective marker.
AB  - A chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal gene delivery system for Lactobacillus acidophilus based on the thyA gene was developed. The selected L. acidophilus DOM La strain carries a mutated thyA gene and has an obligate requirement for thymidine. This strain can be used as a host for the constructed shuttle vector pFXL03, lacking antibiotic-resistant markers but having the wild-type thyA gene from L. casei which complements the thyA chromosomal mutation. The vector also contains the replicon region from plasmid pUC19 and that of the Lactococcus plasmid pWV01, which allows the transfer between Escherichia coli, L. casei and L. acidophilus. Eight unique restriction sites (i.e., PstI, HindIII, SphI, SalI, AccI, XbaI, KpnI and SacI) are available for cloning. After 40-time transfers in modified MRS medium, no plasmid loss was observed. The vector pFXL03 is potentially useful as a food-grade vaccine delivery system for L. acidophilus.
TI  - Structural and functional similarities in the ADP-forming amide bond ligase superfamily: implications for a substrate-induced conformational change in folylpolyglutamate synthetase.
AB  - Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) and the bacterial cell wall ligase UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine:d-glutamate ligase (MurD) reveals that these two enzymes have a remarkable structural similarity despite a low level of sequence identity. Both enzymes have a modular, multi-domain structure and catalyse a similar ATP-dependent reaction involving the addition of a glutamate residue to a carboxylate-containing substrate, tetrahydrofolate in the case of FPGS, and UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine in the case of MurD. Site-directed mutations of selected residues in the active site of Lactobacillus casei FPGS (P74A, E143A, E143D, E143Q, K185A, D313A, H316A, G411A and S412A) showed that most of these changes resulted in an almost complete loss of activity. Several of these amino acid residues in FPGS are found in structurally equivalent positions to active-site residues in MurD. Some insights into the function of these residues in FPGS activity are proposed, based on the roles surmised from the structures of two MurD. UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine.ADP complexes and a MurD. UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine-d-glutamate complex. Furthermore, the comparison has led us to propose that conformational changes induced by substrate binding in the reaction mechanism of FPGS result in a movement of the domains towards each other to more closely resemble the orientation of the corresponding domains in MurD. This relative domain movement may be a key feature of this new family of ADP-forming amide bond ligases.
TI  - Quantitative approach in the study of adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to intestinal cells and their competition with enterobacteria.
AB  - To describe the phenomena of bacterial adhesion to intestinal cells and the competition for adhesion between bacteria, mathematical equations based on a simple dissociation process involving a finite number of bacterial receptors on intestinal cell surface were developed. The equations allow the estimation of the maximum number of Lactobacillus sp. and Escherichia coli cells that can adhere to Caco-2 cells and intestinal mucus; they also characterize the affinity of the bacteria to Caco-2 cells and intestinal and fecal mucus and the theoretical adhesion ratio of two bacteria present in a mixed suspension. The competition for adhesion between Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and E. coli TG1 appeared to follow the proposed kinetics, whereas the competition between Lactobacillus casei Shirota and E. coli TG1 may involve multiple adhesion sites or a soluble factor in the culture medium of the former. The displacement of the adhered Lactobacillus by E. coli TG1 seemed to be a rapid process, whereas the displacement of E. coli TG1 by the Lactobacillus took more than an hour.
TI  - Effect of C9-methyl substitution and C8-C9 conformational restriction on antifolate and antitumor activity of classical 5-substituted 2,4-diaminofuro[2,3-d]pyrimidines.
AB  - N-[4-[1-methyl-2-(2,4-diaminofuro[2, 3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (5) and its C8-C9 conformationally restricted E- and Z-isomers (6 and 7) were designed and synthesized in order to investigate the effect of incorporating a methyl group at the C9 position and of conformational restriction at the C8-C9 bridge of N-[4-[2-(2,4-diaminofuro[2, 3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (1) with respect to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitory activity as well as antitumor activity. The compounds were synthesized by a Wittig reaction of 2,4-diamino-5-(chloromethyl)furo[2,3-d]pyrimidine with ethyl 4-acetylbenzoate followed by catalytic reduction, hydrolysis, and standard peptide coupling with diethyl L-glutamate. The biological results indicated that the addition of a 9-methyl group to the C8-C9 bridge, as in 5, increased recombinant human (rh) DHFR inhibitory potency (IC(50) = 0.42 microM) as well as the potency against the growth inhibition of tumor cells in culture (CCRF-CEM EC(50) = 29 nM, A253 EC(50) = 28.5 nM, and FaDu EC(50) = 17.5 nM) compared with the 9-desmethyl analogue 1. However, the conformationally restricted 4:1 Z/E mixture of 7 and 6 was less potent than 5 in both assays, and the pure E-isomer 6 was essentially inactive. These three classical analogues were also evaluated as inhibitors of Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, and rat and rh thymidylate synthase (TS) and were found to be weak inhibitors. All three analogues 5-7 were good substrates for human folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). These data suggested that FPGS is relatively tolerant to different conformations in the bridge region. Further evaluation of the cytotoxicity of 5 and 7 in methotrexate (MTX)-resistant CCRF-CEM cell sublines suggested that polyglutamylation was crucial for their mechanism of action. Metabolite protection studies of 5 implicated DHFR as the primary intracellular target. Compound 5 showed GI(50) values in 10(-9)-10(-7) M range against more than 30 tumor cell lines in culture.
TI  - Cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris against Clostridium spp.
AB  - The growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris Link. Pt. (Ascomycotina: Clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of Coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. The biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. This compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward Clostridium paraputrificum and Clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and Escherichia coli. However, C. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. militaris. As a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic treatment in a neonatal animal model.
AB  - The clinical use of probiotic agents such as enteral Lactobacillus to enhance intestinal defense against potential luminal pathogens has been tested in vivo; however, an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the observed protection is lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus on bacterial translocation (BT) in a neonatal animal model. Newborn New Zealand white rabbit pups were enterally fed a 10% Formulac solution inoculated with or without a 10(8) suspension of ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli K1 (E. coli K1A) and/or Lactobacillus casei GG (Lacto GG). Pups received either no bacteria (n = 10), Lacto GG (n = 8), E. coli K1A (n = 26), or a combination of Lacto GG and E. coli K1A (n = 33). On day 3, representative tissue specimens from the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen (SPL), and liver (LIV) were aseptically harvested in addition to a small-bowel (SB) sample that was rinsed to remove luminal contents. The specimens were then cultured in organism-specific media. Statistical analysis was by one-way ANOVA with P values less than 0.05 considered significant. Neonatal rabbits receiving Lacto GG-supplemented formula exhibited a 25% decrease (P < 0.05) in small-bowel colonization by E. coli K1A. In addition, Lacto GG decreased the frequency of extraintestinal BT by 46% (P < 0.05), 61% (P < 0.05), and 23%, respectively, in the MLN, SPL, and LIV. We have shown that enterally-administered Lacto GG decreases the frequency of E. coli K1A translocation in a neonatal rabbit model. These results may have significant implications for the treatment of BT and sepsis in the human neonate and provide a model for further studies.
TI  - Cloning of the gene of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Lactobacillus casei ATCC 27092 and characterization of the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GlcNAcase) of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 27092 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene consisted of 1581 nucleotides, and had a promoter, Shine-Dalgarno, and rho-independent type transcription termination sequences typical in bacteria. The protein deduced from the sequence consisted of 526 amino acids, and had a putative signal peptide of 14 amino acids and 5 possible asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. A conserved sequence was homologous to the 12 other hexosaminidases from different origins. The recombinant GlcNAcase (r-GlcNAcase) purified from the transformed E. coli had a MW of 39 kDa and lacked oligosaccharide chains. The isoelectric point and the optimum pH for the activity of r-GlcNAcase were similar to those of original GlcNAcases (o-GlcNAcase). However, the thermal stability was lower, and sensitivity to Cd2+, Fe2+, Cu2+ and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was higher than those of o-GlcNAcases, suggesting that the oligosaccharide moieties of the enzyme contribute to their stability. The Km value for p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-1,4-D-glucosamine (PNP-GlcNAc) of r-GlcNAcase (6.4 microM) implied that the affinity of r-GlcNAcase for the substrate was 200-fold higher than that of the original ones.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the ccpA gene from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enzymes involved in the metabolism of complex carbon and energy sources are unnecessary under conditions of abundant, readily metabolisable nutrients such as glucose or fructose. The repression of these enzymes by glucose has been termed carbon catabolite repression. Mechanisms involved in the carbon catabolite repression in gram-positive bacteria are known to differ from those of gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. It appears to be mediated by transcriptional repression, requiring trans-acting CcpA, a member of the LacI-GalR family of bacterial regulatory proteins and a cis-acting consensus sequence, designated cre. Here, we report the cloning and characterisation of the chromosomal ccpA gene from Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. This gene is predicted to encode a 333 amino acids protein with nearly 75% identity to CcpA of Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Biosynthesis of lipoteichoic acid in Lactobacillus rhamnosus: role of DltD in D-alanylation.
AB  - The dlt operon (dltA to dltD) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 7469 encodes four proteins responsible for the esterification of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) by D-alanine. These esters play an important role in controlling the net anionic charge of the poly (GroP) moiety of LTA. dltA and dltC encode the D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase (Dcl) and D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp), respectively. Whereas the functions of DltA and DltC are defined, the functions of DltB and DltD are unknown. To define the role of DltD, the gene was cloned and sequenced and a mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis of dltD from Lactobacillus casei 102S. Permeabilized cells of a dltD::erm mutant lacked the ability to incorporate D-alanine into LTA. This defect was complemented by the expression of DltD from pNZ123/dlt. In in vitro assays, DltD bound Dcp for ligation with D-alanine by Dcl in the presence of ATP. In contrast, the homologue of Dcp, the Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (ACP), involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, was not bound to DltD and thus was not ligated with D-alanine. DltD also catalyzed the hydrolysis of the mischarged D-alanyl-ACP. The hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of DltD was required for anchoring the protein in the membrane. It is hypothesized that this membrane-associated DltD facilitates the binding of Dcp and Dcl for ligation of Dcp with D-alanine and that the resulting D-alanyl-Dcp is translocated to the primary site of D-alanylation.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactococcus lactis transcription factor FlpA and demonstration of an in vitro switch.
AB  - The commercially important bacterium Lactococcus lactis contains two FNR-like proteins (FlpA and FlpB) which have a high degree of identity to each other and to the FLP of Lactobacillus casei. FlpA was isolated from a GST-FlpA fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli. Like FLP, isolated FlpA is a homodimeric protein containing both Zn and Cu. However, the properties of FlpA were more like those of the E. coli oxygen-responsive transcription factor FNR than the FLP of L. casei. As prepared FlpA recognized an FNR site (TTGAT-N4-ATCAA) but not an FLP site (CCTGA-N4-TCAGG) in band-shift assays. In contrast to FLP, DNA binding by FlpA did not require the formation of an intramolecular disulphide bond. However, despite containing only two cysteine residues per monomer, FlpA was able to acquire an FNR-like, oxygen-labile [4Fe 4S] cluster. But, whereas the incorporation of a [4Fe 4S] cluster into FNR enhances interaction with target DNA, it abolished DNA binding by FlpA. An FlpA variant (FlpA') with an N-terminal region designed to be more FLP-like failed to incorporate an iron-sulphur cluster but could now form an intramolecular disulphide. This simple example of protein engineering, converting an oxygen-labile [4Fe 4S] containing FNR-like protein into a dithiol-disulphide FLP-like redox sensor demonstrates the versatility of the basic CRP structure. Attempts to demonstrate an FlpA-based aerobic-anaerobic switch in the heterologous host E. coli were unsuccessful. However, studies with a series of FNR-dependent lac reporter fusions in strains of E. coli expressing flpA or flpB revealed that both homologues were able to activate expression of FNR-dependent promoters in vivo but only when positioned 61 base pairs upstream of the transcription start.
TI  - Effects of subunit occupancy on partitioning of an intermediate in thymidylate synthase mutants.
AB  - Experimental evidence for a 5-exocyclic methylene-dUMP intermediate in the thymidylate synthase reaction was recently obtained by demonstrating that tryptophan 82 mutants of the Lactobacillus casei enzyme produced 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiomethyl-dUMP (HETM-dUMP) (Barret, J. E., Maltby, D. A., Santi, D. V., and Schultz, P. G. (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 449-450). The unusual product was proposed to emanate from trapping of the intermediate with beta-mercaptoethanol in competition with hydride transfer from H(4)folate to form dTMP. Using mutants of the C-terminal residue of thymidylate synthase, we found that the ratio of HETM-dUMP to dTMP varies as a function of CH(2)H(4)folate concentration. This observation seemed inconsistent with the conclusion that both products arose from a common intermediate in which CH(2)H(4)folate was already bound to the enzyme. The enigma was resolved by a kinetic model that allowed for differential partitioning of the intermediate formed on each of the two subunits of the homodimeric enzyme in forming the two different products. With three C-terminal mutants of L. casei TS, HETM-dUMP formation was consistent with a model in which product formation occurs upon occupancy of the first completely bound subunit, the rate of which is unaffected by occupancy of the second subunit. With one analogous E. coli TS mutant, HETM-dUMP formation occurred upon occupancy of the first subunit, but was inhibited when both subunits were occupied. With all mutants, dTMP formation occurs from occupied forms of both subunits at different rates; here, binding of cofactor to the first subunit decreased affinity for the second, but the reaction occurred faster in the enzyme form with both subunits bound to dUMP and CH(2)H(4)folate. The model resolves the apparent enigma of the cofactor-dependent product distribution and supports the conclusion that the exocyclic methylene intermediate is common to both HETM-dUMP and dTMP formation.
TI  - Potentiation of the effectiveness of Lactobacillus casei in the prevention of E.  coli induced diarrhea in conventional and gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - The influence of preventive administration of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei and maltodextrin KMS X-70 on Escherichia coli 08: K88 adhesion in the gastrointestinal tract of 11 conventional and 6 gnotobiotic piglets was investigated. The preventive administration of L. casei alone had almost no inhibitory effect on the adherence of E. coli to the jejunal mucosa of gnotobiotic and conventional piglets while the lactobacilli administered together with maltodextrin decreased the number of E. coli colonising jejunal mucosa of gnotobiotic piglets by 1 logarithm (4.95 log 10/cm2) in comparison with the control group (5.96 log 10/cm2). L. casei administered in combination with maltodextrin decreased the number of E. coli colonising the jejunum of conventional piglets by more than two and half logarithm (4.75 log 10/cm2, p < 0.05) in comparison with the control (7.42 log 10/cm2). The inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus casei and maltodextrin KMS X-70 on the adhesion of E. coli to the intestinal mucosa of conventional and gnotobiotic pigs was probably mediated by Lactobacillus--produced antibacterial substances and stimulation of immunity.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of Coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of Coptis japonica (Makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (BS), berberine iodide (BI), palmatine chloride (PC), and palmatine sulfate(PS)], as well as that of Thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The biologically active constituents of the Coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (BC), palmatine iodide (PI), and coptisine chloride (CC) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. In a test using 500 microg/disk, BC and PI produced a clear inhibitory effect against Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli. At 1000 microg/ disk, CC revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas EGCG exhibited weak growth inhibition against only C. perfringens and C. paraputrificum. Among various isoquinoline alkaloids, BC exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward C. perfringens than BI and BS, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in PI compared to PC and PS. The Coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of B. longum and C. perfringens.
TI  - The effect of probiotic bacteria on the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  - Human intestinal glycoproteins extracted from faeces were used as a model for intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains, and the effect of probiotics on this adhesion. S-fimbriated E. coli expressed relatively high adhesion in the mucus model, but the other tested pathogens adhered less effectively. Probiotic strains Lactobacillus GG and L. rhamnosus LC-705 as well as a L. rhamnosus isolated from human faeces were able to slightly reduce S-fimbria-mediated adhesion. Adhesion of S. typhimurium was significantly inhibited by probiotic L. johnsonii LJ1 and L. casei Shirota. Lactobacillus GG and L. rhamnosus (human isolate) increased the adhesion of S. typhimurium suggesting that the pathogen interacts with the probiotic.
TI  - Elements involved in catabolite repression and substrate induction of the lactose operon in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - In Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, the chromosomally encoded lactose operon, lacTEGF, encodes an antiterminator protein (LacT), lactose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) elements (LacE and LacF), and a phospho-beta-galactosidase. lacT, lacE, and lacF mutant strains were constructed by double crossover. The lacT strain displayed constitutive termination at a ribonucleic antiterminator (RAT) site, whereas lacE and lacF mutants showed an inducer-independent antiterminator activity, as shown analysis of enzyme activity obtained from transcriptional fusions of lac promoter (lacp) and lacpDeltaRAT with the Escherichia coli gusA gene in the different lac mutants. These results strongly suggest that in vivo under noninducing conditions, the lactose-specific PTS elements negatively modulate LacT activity. Northern blot analysis detected a 100-nucleotide transcript starting at the transcription start site and ending a consensus RAT sequence and terminator region. In a ccpA mutant, transcription initiation was derepressed but no elongation through the terminator was observed in the presence of glucose and the inducing sugar, lactose. Full expression of lacTEGF was found only in a man ccpA double mutant, indicating that PTS elements are involved in the CcpA-independent catabolite repression mechanism probably via LacT.
TI  - Instruments for oral disease-intervention strategies: recombinant Lactobacillus casei expressing tetanus toxin fragment C for vaccination or myelin proteins for oral tolerance induction in multiple sclerosis.
AB  - Lactobacillus strains possess properties that make them attractive candidates as  vehicles for oral administration of therapeutics. In this report we describe the construction and analysis of recombinant Lactobacillus casei applicable in oral vaccination against an infectious disease (tetanus) and in oral tolerance induction for intervention in an autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. Recombinant L. casei which express surface-anchored tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) were generated. Quantitative analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated a high level of cell wall-bound expression of TTFC and immunogenicity was demonstrated by parenteral immunization with whole cell extracts of the recombinants. A series of expression vectors was constructed to secrete human myelin basic protein (hMBP) or hMBP as a fusion protein with beta-glucuronidase from Escherichia coli. These heterologous products produced by L. casei were detected in the growth medium and parenteral immunization with this medium evoked antibodies against hMBP, confirming that secretion indeed had occurred. Based on the different localization of the heterologous proteins, lactobacilli expressing surface-anchored TTFC are ideally suited for the induction of antibody responses, whereas lactobacilli that secrete myelin proteins can be used for the induction of peripheral T-cell tolerance. In conclusion, the specific technology described here allows the construction of a wide array of safe live recombinant lactobacilli which may prove to be useful in oral intervention strategies for the prevention of infectious diseases or treatment of autoimmune diseases.
TI  - Insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  - Most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. Two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon Tn916 mutagenesis of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (Challis). A 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dltA and dltB of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (formerly called Lactobacillus casei). A 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous DNA in a fosmid library of S. gordonii DL1. This DNA encoded D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in Escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. The cloned streptococcal dltA was disrupted by inserting an ermAM cassette, and then it was linearized and transformed into S. gordonii DL1 for allelic replacement. Erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dltA exhibited a loss of D-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. This phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kDa surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (C. J. Whittaker, D. L. Clemans, and P. E. Kolenbrander, Infect. Immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). The mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric coaggregations. The mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. The natural DNA transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. Southern analysis of chromosomal DNAs from various streptococcal species with the dltA probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. Thus, it is hypothesized that D-alanyl LTA may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kDa adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.
TI  - Homofermentative production of D- or L-lactate in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli RR1.
AB  - We investigated metabolic engineering of fermentation pathways in Escherichia coli for production of optically pure D- or L-lactate. Several pta mutant strains were examined, and a pta mutant of E. coli RR1 which was deficient in the phosphotransacetylase of the Pta-AckA pathway was found to metabolize glucose to D-lactate and to produce a small amount of succinate by-product under anaerobic conditions. An additional mutation in ppc made the mutant produce D-lactate like a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium. When the pta ppc double mutant was grown to higher biomass concentrations under aerobic conditions before it shifted to the anaerobic phase of D-lactate production, more than 62.2 g of D-lactate per liter was produced in 60 h, and the volumetric productivity was 1.04 g/liter/h. To examine whether the blocked acetate flux could be reoriented to a nonindigenous L-lactate pathway, an L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Lactobacillus casei was introduced into a pta ldhA strain which lacked phosphotransacetylase and D-lactate dehydrogenase. This recombinant strain was able to metabolize glucose to L-lactate as the major fermentation product, and up to 45 g of L-lactate per liter was produced in 67 h. These results demonstrate that the central fermentation metabolism of E. coli can be reoriented to the production of D-lactate, an indigenous fermentation product, or to the production of L-lactate, a nonindigenous fermentation product.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Inactivity of N229A thymidylate synthase due to water-mediated effects: isolating a late stage in methyl transfer.
AB  - Mutation of thymidylate synthase N229(177) to alanine results in an essentially inactive enzyme, yet it leads to formation of a stable ternary complex. The kinetics of N229(177)A show that kcat for Escherichia coli is reduced by 200-fold while the Km for dUMP is increased 200-fold and the Km for folate increased by tenfold versus the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structures of N229(177)A in complex with dUMP and CB3717, and in complex with dUMP alone are determined at 2.4 A, and 2.5 A resolution. These structures identify the covalently bound ternary complex and show how N229(177)A traps an intermediate, and so becomes inactive in a later step of the reaction. Since the smaller alanine side-chain at N229(177)A does not directly sterically impair binding of ligands, the structures implicate, and place quantitative limits on the involvement of the structured water network in the active site of thymidylate synthase in both catalysis and in determining the binding affinity for dUMP (in contrast, the N229(177)V mutation in Lactobacillus casei has minimal effect on activity).
TI  - Crystal structures of a unique thermal-stable thymidylate synthase from Bacillus  subtilis.
AB  - Unlike all other organisms studied to date, Bacillus subtilis expresses two different thymidylate synthases: bsTS-A and bsTS-B. bsTS-A displays enhanced enzymatic and structural thermal stability uncharacteristic of most TSs. Despite the high level of TS conservation across most species, bsTS-A shares low sequence identity (<40%) with the majority of TSs from other organisms. This TS and the TSs from Lactococcus lactis and phage Phi3T-to which it is most similar-have been of interest for some time since, by structure-based sequence alignment, they appear to lack several key residues shown by mutagenesis to be essential to enzymatic function [Greene, P. J., Yu, P. L., Zhao, J., Schiffer, C. A., and Santi, D. (1994) Protein Sci. 3, 1114-6]. In addition, bsTS-A demonstrates specific activity 2-3-fold higher than TS from Lactobacillus casei or Escherichia coli. We have solved the crystal structure of this unusual TS in four crystal forms to a maximum resolution of 1.7 A. Each of these crystal forms contains either one or two noncrystallographically related dimers. Stabilization of the beta-sheet dimer interface through a dramatic architecture of buttressed internal salt bridges maintains the structural integrity of bsTS-A at elevated temperatures. Melting curves of TSs from L. casei and E. coli are compared to that of TS-A from B. subtilis and correlated with numbers of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and the numbers of interactions localized to the dimer interface. Analysis of this structure will shed light on the conservation of function across diversity of sequence, as well as provide insights into the thermal stabilization of a highly conserved enzyme.
TI  - Effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme Q10, and L-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  - The involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1, and fumonisin B1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. The strains used in this study included Escherichia coli (FT 101), Streptococcus agalactiae (FT 311, FT 313, FT 315), Staphylococcus aureus (FT 192), Yersinia enterocolitica (FT 430), Salmonella infantis (FT 431), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (FT 432), Lactobacillus plantarum (FT234) and Lactobacillus casei (FT 232). Tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. Tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. A combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. It was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. The objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the toxic effects of the mycotoxins. The data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by T-2 toxin, aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A and that this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme Q10 plus l-carnitine.
TI  - Suppression of the ptsH mutation in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium by a DNA fragment from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - A DNA fragment from Lactobacillus casei that restores growth to Escherichia coli  and Salmonella typhimurium ptsH mutants on glucose and other substrates of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) has been isolated. These mutants lack the HPr protein, a general component of the PTS. Sequencing of the cloned fragment revealed the absence of ptsH homologues. Instead, the complementation ability was located in a 120-bp fragment that contained a sequence homologue to the binding site of the Cra regulator from enteric bacteria. Experiments indicated that the reversion of the ptsH phenotype was due to a titration of the Cra protein, which allowed the constitutive expression of the fructose operon.
TI  - Structure-based design and synthesis of lipophilic 2,4-diamino-6-substituted quinazolines and their evaluation as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductases and potential antitumor agents.
AB  - The synthesis and biological activities of 14 6-substituted 2,4-diaminoquinazolines are reported. These compounds were designed to improve the cell penetration of a previously reported series of 2,4-diamino-6-substituted-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines which had shown significant potency and remarkable selectivity for Toxoplasma gondii dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), but had much lower inhibitory effects on the growth of T. gondii cells in culture. The target N9-H analogues were obtained via regiospecific reductive amination of the appropriate benzaldehydes with 2,4,6-triaminoquinazoline, which, in turn, was synthesized from 2,4-diamino-6-nitroquinazoline. The N9-CH3 analogues were synthesized via a regiospecific reductive methylation of the corresponding N9-H precursors. The compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of DHFR from human, Pneumocystis carinii, T. gondii, rat liver, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli, and selected analogues were evaluated as inhibitors of the growth of tumor cells in culture. These analogues displayed potent T. gondii DHFR inhibition as well as inhibition of the growth of T. gondii cells in culture. Further, selected analogues were potent inhibitors of the growth of tumor cells in culture in the in vitro screening program of the National Cancer Institute with GI50s in the nanomolar and subnanomolar range. Crystallographic data for the ternary complex of hDHFR-NADPH and 2,4-diamino-6-[N-(2', 5'-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-methylamino]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine, 1c, reveal the first structural details for a reversed N9-C10 folate bridge geometry as well as the first conformational details of a hybrid piritrexim-trimetrexate analogue.
TI  - Aspartate 221 of thymidylate synthase is involved in folate cofactor binding and  in catalysis.
AB  - Structural studies indicate that Asp 221 of Lactobacilluscasei thymidylate synthase forms a hydrogen bond network with the 2-amino and 3-imino groups of the folate [Matthews, D. A. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 214, 937-948; Finer-Moore, J. S. (1990)Biochemistry 29, 6977-6986] that has been proposed to participate in catalysis. We prepared a complete replacement set of 19 mutants at position 221 of L. casei thymidylate synthase. Of these, the only one with sufficient activity to complement growth of a thymidylate synthase-deficient host was the Cys mutant. To further elucidate the function of the Asp 221 side chain, seven thymidylate synthase 221 mutants were studied in detail with regard to catalysis of dTMP formation and of thymidylate synthase partial reactions. Most of the mutants bound the nucleotide substrate dUMP with only moderate loss of binding affinity, indicating that the Asp side chain does not contribute to dUMP binding. Most of the mutants catalyzed the cofactor-independent dehalogenation of 5-bromodUMP; hence, the Asp side chain of TS is not essential for addition of the catalytic Cys residue to the nucleotide substrate. Mutants showed decreased affinity for the folate cofactor, but those with side chains capable of hydrogen bond formation were less severely affected. Some of the mutants were capable of forming covalent thymidylate synthase-5-fluorodUMP-methylenetetrahydrofolate complex; hence, the Asp side chain is not essential for steps leading to the covalent complex. We conclude that the hydrogen bond network between Asp 221 and the folate cofactor contributes to cofactor binding and a catalytic step after formation of the covalent ternary complex intermediate.
TI  - Adhesion of some probiotic and dairy Lactobacillus strains to Caco-2 cell cultures.
AB  - The adhesion of 12 different Lactobacillus strains was studied using Caco-2 cell  line as an in vitro model for intestinal epithelium. Some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. Human and bovine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Bacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. The adherence of bacteria was also observed microscopically after Gram staining. Viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. Among the tested strains, L. casei (Fyos) was the most adhesive strain and L. casei var. rhamnosus (Lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to Caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. The corresponding values for positive and negative control E. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. The Lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. The four most adhesive strains were L. casei (Fyos), L. acidophilus 1 (LC1), L. rhamnosus LC-705 and Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103). No significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. Adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of Caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the Caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. Viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90% of the bacteria were viable with the exception of L. acidophilus 1 which was 74% viable. Microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in Gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.
TI  - The gal genes for the Leloir pathway of Lactobacillus casei 64H.
AB  - The gal genes from the chromosome of Lactobacillus casei 64H were cloned by complementation of the galK2 mutation of Escherichia coli HB101. The pUC19 derivative pKBL1 in one complementation-positive clone contained a 5.8-kb DNA HindIII fragment. Detailed studies with other E. coli K-12 strains indicated that plasmid pKBL1 contains the genes coding for a galactokinase (GalK), a galactose 1-phosphate-uridyltransferase (GalT), and a UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GalE). In vitro assays demonstrated that the three enzymatic activities are expressed from pKBL1. Sequence analysis revealed that pKBL1 contained two additional genes, one coding for a repressor protein of the LacI-GalR-family and the other coding for an aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase). The gene order of the L. casei gal operon is galKETRM. Because parts of the gene for the mutarotase as well as the promoter region upstream of galK were not cloned on pKBL1, the regions flanking the HindIII fragment of pKBL1 were amplified by inverse PCR. Northern blot analysis showed that the gal genes constitute an operon that is transcribed from two promoters. The galKp promoter is inducible by galactose in the medium, while galEp constitutes a semiconstitutive promoter located in galK.
TI  - Mode of action of site-directed irreversible folate analogue inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - 5,8-Dideazafolate analogues are tight binding but not irreversible inhibitors of  thymidylate synthase (TS). However, when a chloroacetyl (ClAc) group is substituted at the N10-position of 2-desamino-2-methyl-5,8-dideazafolate (DMDDF), the resulting compound, ClAc-DMDDF, although still a reversible inhibitor (KI = 3.4 x 10(-3) M), gradually inactivates thyA-TS irreversibly at a rate of 0.37 min-1. The corresponding iodoacetyl derivative alkylated the enzyme somewhat slower (k3 = 0.15 min-1 ) than ClAc-DMDDF but was bound more tightly (KI = 1.4 x 10(-5) M), resulting in a second-order rate constant (k3/KI) of inactivation that was 100-fold greater than that of ClAc-DMDDF. A tryptic digest of the ClAc-DMDDF-inactivated enzyme yielded a peptide on HPLC, which revealed that cysteine-146, the residue at the active site that is intimately involved in the catalytic process, had reacted with ClAc-DMDDF to form a covalent bond. This derivative was confirmed indirectly by Edman analysis and more directly by mass spectrometry. Deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate, a substrate in the catalytic reaction, protected against inactivation. Similar to previously described Lactobacillus casei TS inhibition studies with sulfhydryl reagents [Galivan, J., Noonan, J., and Maley, F. (1977) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 184, 336-345], the kinetics of inhibition suggested that complete inhibition occurs on reaction of only one of the two active site cysteines, although sequence and amino acid analysis revealed that iodoacetate and ClAc-DMDDF had reacted with both active site cysteines. These studies demonstrate that a sulfhydryl reactive compound that is directed to the folate binding site of TS may diffuse to the active site cysteine, and form a covalent bond with this residue. How this inhibition comes about is suggested in a stereoscopic view of the ligand when modeled to the known crystal structure of Escherichia coli TS.
TI  - Oxygen-dependent regulation of the expression of the catalase gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei LTH677.
AB  - The catalase gene katA of Lactobacillus sakei LTH677 was cloned and expressed in  Escherichia coli UM2, Lactobacillus casei LK1, and Lactobacillus curvatus LTH1432. The last host is a catalase-deficient plasmid-cured derivative of a starter organism used in meat fermentation. The regulation of katA expression was found to be the same in L. sakei LTH677 and the recombinant strains. The addition of H2O2 to anaerobic cultures, as well as a switch to aerobic conditions, resulted in a strong increase in KatA activity. The expression was investigated in more detail with L. sakei LTH677 and L. curvatus LTH4002. The recombinant strain LTH4002 did not accumulate H2O2 under glucose-limited aerobic conditions and remained viable in the stationary phase. Under inductive conditions, the katA-specific mRNA and the apoenzyme were synthesized de novo. Deletion derivatives of the katA promoter were produced, and the regulatory response was investigated by fusion to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene gusA and expression in L. sakei LTH677. The fact that gene expression was subject to induction was confirmed at the level of transcription and protein synthesis. A small putative regulatory sequence of at least 25 bp was identified located upstream of the -35 site. Competition experiments performed with L. sakei LTH677 harboring the fusion constructs consisting of the katA promoter and gusA revealed that an activator protein is involved in the transcriptional induction of katA.
TI  - A novel regulatory switch mediated by the FNR-like protein of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - FNR (regulator for fumarate and nitrate reduction) and CRP (cAMP receptor protein) are global regulators which regulate the transcription of overlapping modulons of target genes in response to anaerobiosis and carbon source in Escherichia coli. An ORF, designated flp because it encodes an FNR-like protein of the FNR-CRP family, has been found in Lactobacillus casei. The product of the flp coding region (FLP) was overproduced in E. coli, purified and crystallized. FLP is a homodimeric protein in which each subunit can form an intramolecular disulphide bond. The isolated protein also contains non-stoichiometric amounts of Cu and Zn. Although the DNA recognition helix of FLP resembles that of FNR, the flp gene failed to complement the anaerobic respiratory deficiency of an fnr mutant when expressed in E. coli and it neither activated nor interfered with transcription from FNR- or CRP-dependent promoters in E. coli. Site-specific DNA binding by oxidized FLP (the form containing intrasubunit disulphide bonds) was abolished by reduction. The interconversion between disulphide and dithiol forms thus provides the basis for a novel redox-mediated transcriptional switch. Two non-identical FLP-binding sites, distinct from FNR- and CRP-binding sites, were identified in the meIR region of E. coli by gel-retardation analysis. A further eight FLP-binding sites were selected from a random library. A synthetic oligonucleotide conforming to a putative FLP site consensus, CA/CTGA-N4-TCAG/TG (the most significant bases are underlined), was retarded by FLP. Functional tests showed that FLP represses the aerobic transcription of a semi-synthetic promoter in E. coli. A C5S variant of FLP lacking the ability to form intramolecular disulphide bonds was unable to bind to FLP sites and failed to repress transcription in vivo.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of promoters from the Lactobacillus casei temperate bacteriophage A2.
AB  - Random Sau3A1 DNA fragments from the temperate Lactobacillus bacteriophage A2 were cloned into the promoter-probe plasmid pGKV210. Seven DNA fragments with promoter activity were selected, after transformation of Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis, subsp, lactis, through the chloramphenicol resistance they conferred to the corresponding clones. The seven promoters were functional in Lactobacillus casei. Their strength was analysed by measuring the levels of chloramphenicol resistance and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity induced in each host. The nucleotide sequences of these fragments were determined and primer extension analysis was used to locate the initiation site of transcription from each promoter in E coli. The promoters contained -10 and -35 regions similar to the consensus sequences of E. coli and Lactobacillus promoters.
TI  - Anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  - Reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. As expected, the cations Fe2+ and Cu+ enhanced killing of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 by hydroperoxides. However, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to O2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. Sensitivities to anaerobic killing by Fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. The oral streptococci Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 10558, Streptococcus rattus FA-1, and Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 were approximately as sensitive as S. mutans GS-5. Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790, Actinomyces viscosus OMZ105E, and Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45 had intermediate sensitivity, while Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 and Escherichia coli B were insensitive. Killing of S. mutans GS-5 in response to millimolar levels of added Fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and pH. The organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. Chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. Sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to Fe2+ exposure. Fe2+, but not Fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of S. mutans. The reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to Fe2+ inhibition of F-ATPase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or F1 enzyme separated from membranes. Cu+ and Cu2+ also inhibited F-ATPase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. All of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  - In the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, Candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. Three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. Among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different Gram-positive bacteria. It inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/mL which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. It functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. The antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.
TI  - Effects of single-residue substitutions on negative cooperativity in ligand binding to dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The effects of six amino acid substitutions in Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate  reductase, predominantly in the coenzyme binding site, on catalysis and on the negative cooperativity between NADPH and tetrahydrofolate binding have been determined. Replacement of Leu62, His64 or Leu54 by alanine has no effect on kcat, and produces only modest changes in negative cooperativity. Alanine substitution of His77, which interacts indirectly with the coenzyme adenine ring, leads to a doubling of the negative cooperativity and a consequent doubling of kcat. Replacement of Arg43, which interacts with the coenzyme 2'-phosphate, by alanine, or of Trp21, which interacts with the coenzyme nicotinamide ring, by histidine leads to a 20-100-fold decrease in negative cooperativity. In both mutants there is a decrease in kcat; isotope effects show that product release is largely rate-limiting in R43A, whereas in W21H hydride ion transfer is rate-limiting. 1H NMR has been used to obtain information on the extent of the structural changes produced by the substitutions. This varies from very local effects in H64A to very widespread effects in W21H. These changes are used as the basis for discussion of the mechanisms of the functional effects of the various substitutions. It is suggested that residues in helix C, beta-strand 3 and the beta3-beta4 loop may be involved in the transmission of effects between the coenzyme and substrate binding sites.
TI  - Molecular genetic characterization of the L-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) of  Lactobacillus helveticus and biochemical characterization of the enzyme.
AB  - The Lactobacillus helveticus L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) gene (ldhL) was  isolated from a lambda library. The nucleotide sequence of the ldhL gene was determined and shown to have the capacity to encode a protein of 323 amino acids (35.3 kDa). The deduced sequence of the 35-kDa protein revealed a relatively high degree of identity with other lactobacillar L-LDHs. The highest identity (80.2%) was observed with the Lactobacillus casei L-LDH. The sizes and 5' end analyses of ldhL transcripts showed that the ldhL gene is a monocistronic transcriptional unit. The expression of ldhL, studied as a function of growth, revealed a high expression level at the logarithmic phase of growth. The ldhL gene is preceded by two putative -10 regions, but no corresponding -35 regions could be identified. By primer extension analysis, the ldhL transcripts were confirmed to be derived from the -10 region closest to the initiation codon. However, upstream of these regions additional putative -10/-35 regions could be found. The L-LDH was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by two chromatographic steps. The purified L-LDH was shown to be a nonaliosteric enzyme, and amino acid residues involved in allosteric regulation were not conserved in L. helveticus L-LDH. However, a slight enhancement of enzyme activity was observed in the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, particularly at neutral pH. A detailed enzymatic characterization of L-LDH was performed. The optimal reaction velocity was at pH 5.0, where the kinetic parameters K(m), and Kcat for pyruvate were 0.25 mM and 643 S-1, respectively.
TI  - Structure and regulation of expression of the Bacillus subtilis valyl-tRNA synthetase gene.
AB  - We have sequenced the valyl-tRNA synthetase gene (valS) of Bacillus subtilis and  found an open reading frame coding for a protein of 880 amino acids with a molar mass of 101,749. The predicted amino acid sequence shares strong similarity with the valyl-tRNA synthetases from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli. Extracts of B. subtilis strains overexpressing the valS gene on a plasmid have increased valyl-tRNA aminoacylation activity. Northern analysis shows that valS is cotranscribed with the folC gene (encoding folyl-polyglutamate synthetase) lying downstream. The 300-bp 5' noncoding region of the gene contains the characteristic regulatory elements, T box, "specifier codon" (GUC), and rho-independant transcription terminator of a gene family in gram-positive bacteria that encodes many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and some amino acid biosynthetic enzymes and that is regulated by tRNA-mediated antitermination. We have shown that valS expression is induced by valine limitation and that the specificity of induction can be switched to threonine by changing the GUC (Val) specifier triplet to ACC (Thr). Overexpression of valS from a recombinant plasmid leads to autorepression of a valS-lacZ transcriptional fusion. Like induction by valine starvation, autoregulation of valS depends on the presence of the GUC specifier codon. Disruption of the valS gene was not lethal, suggesting the existence of a second gene, as is the case for both the thrS and the tyrS genes.
TI  - The lac operon of Lactobacillus casei contains lacT, a gene coding for a protein  of the Bg1G family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  - The 5' region of the lac operon of Lactobacillus casei has been investigated. An  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lacT, was identified upstream of lacE. The gene product encoded by lacT is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes BglG from Escherichia coli, ArbG from Erwinia chrysanthemi, SacT, SacY, and LicT from Bacillus subtilis, and BglR from Lactococcus lactis. Amino acid sequence identities range from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. The transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lacT. The corresponding mRNA would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus RNA binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. LacT was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a B. subtilis test system using the sacB target sequence. lacT directly precedes lacEGF, the genes coding for enzyme IICB, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme IIA, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. Northern hybridizations with probes against lacT, lacE, and lacF revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mRNAs of several L. casei strains. Since the length of the lac mRNA is just sufficient to contain lacTEGF, we conclude that the lac operon of L. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - High level heterologous protein production in Lactococcus and Lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the Lactobacillus brevis S-layer signals.
AB  - A secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a S-layer  protein (SlpA) from Lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. E. coli beta-lactamase (Bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the S-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pGK12. In all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpA signals and all Bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. The Lb. brevis S-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in L. lactis, Lb. brevis and Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. gasseri the slpA promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in Lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. The production of Bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. The highest yield of Bla was obtained with L. lactis and Lb. brevis. Without pH control, substantial degradation of Bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) tested. When growing L. lactis and Lb. brevis under pH control, the Bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. L. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of Bla which to our knowledge represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by LAB so far. The short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) Bla molecules/cell per h. Such a high rate was also observed with Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpA gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of Bla production. The results obtained indicate wide applicability of the Lb. brevis slpA signals for efficient protein production and secretion in LAB.
TI  - 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) transformation by clostridia isolated from a munition-fed bioreactor: comparison with non-adapted bacteria.
AB  - Several bacterial strains were examined for their ability to degrade the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The strains examined included various clostridial strains isolated from a 4-year-old munition enrichment, related clostridial strains obtained from a culture collection, two enteric bacteria, and three lactobacilli. All Clostridium species tested were able to reduce TNT rapidly in a complex medium. In cell suspension experiments, these strains were also able to reduce 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (DANT) to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (TAT) and to produce a compound that is not yet identified; thus, they could not be distinguished from one another with regard to the pathway of transformation. The enteric strains and the lactobacilli were able to perform the initial reduction of TNT, but none was capable of reducing DANT in cell suspensions.
TI  - 2-amino-4-oxo-5-substituted-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as nonclassical antifolate  inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Six novel 2-amino-4-oxo-5-[(substituted phenyl)sulfanyl]pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines 7-12 were synthesized as potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS) and as antitumor and/or antibacterial agents. The analogues contain a 5-thio substituent with a phenyl, 4'-chlorophenyl, 3',4'-dichlorophenyl, 4'-nitrophenyl, 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl, and 2'-naphthyl on the sulfur, and were synthesized from the key intermediate 2-(pivaloylamino)-4-oxo-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine, 17. Appropriately substituted aryl thiols were appended to the 5-position of 17 via an oxidative addition reaction using iodine, ethanol, and water under conditions which also resulted in the deprotection of the 2-amino group. The compounds were evaluated against human, Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecium, and Pneumocystis carinii (pc) TSs and against human, rat liver (rl), pc, and Toxoplasma gondii (tg) DHFRs. The nonclassical analogues with the 3',4'-dichloro and the 4'-nitro substituents in the side chain (9 and 10) were more potent than N-[4-[N-[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-N-prop- 2-ynylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (PDDF, 1) and N-[5-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-N- methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-L-glutamic acid (ZD1694,2) against human TS. Analogues with the 4'-chloro, 3',4'-dimethoxy, and naphthyl side chains (8, 11 and 12) were more potent than the unsubstituted phenyl analogue (7) but less than 2, 9, and 10 by 1 order of magnitude. They were all poor inhibitors of human, rl, and pc DHFRs (IC50 = 10(-5) M) but moderate inhibitors (IC50 = 10(-6) M) of tg DHFR. The 4-nitro analogue, 10 (EC50 1.5 microM), was comparable to PDDF in its potency as an inhibitor of the growth of the FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma cell line.
TI  - The D-Alanyl carrier protein in Lactobacillus casei: cloning, sequencing, and expression of dltC.
AB  - The incorporation of D-alanine into membrane-associated D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid in Lactobacillus casei requires the 56-kDa D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase (Dcl) and the 8.9-kDa D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp). To identify and isolate the gene encoding Dcp, we have cloned and sequenced a 4.3-kb chromosomal fragment that contains dcl (dltA). In addition to this gene, the fragment contains three other genes, dltB, d1tC, and a partial dltD gene. dltC (246 nucleotides) was subcloned from this region and expressed in Escherichia coli. The product was identified as apo-Dcp lacking the N-terminal methionine (8,787.9 Da). The in vitro conversion of the recombinant apo-Dcp to holo-Dcp by recombinant E. coli holo-ACP synthase provided Dcp which accepts activated D-alanine in the reaction catalyzed by Bcl. The recombinant D-alanyl-Dcp was functionally identical to native D-alanyl-Dcp in the incorporation of D-alanine into lipoteichoic acid. L. casei Dcp is 46% identical to the putative product of dltC in the Bacillus subtilis dlt operon (M. Perego, P. Glaser, A. Minutello, M. A. Strauch, K. Leopold, and W. Fischer, J. Biol. Chem. 270:15598-15606, 1995), and therefore, this gene also encodes Dcp. Comparisons of the primary sequences and predicted secondary structures of the L. casei and B. subtilis Dcps with that of the E. coli acyl carrier protein (ACP) were undertaken together with homology modeling to identify the functional determinants of the donor and acceptor specificities of Dcp. In the region of the phospho-pantetheine attachment site, significant similarity between Dcps and ACPs was observed. This similarity may account for the relaxed acceptor specificity of the Dcps and ACPs in the ligation Of D-alanine catalyzed by Dcl. In contrast, two Dcp consensus sequences, KXXVLDXLA and DXVKXNXD, share little identity with the rest of the ACP family and, thus, may determine the donor specificity of D-alanyl-Dcp in the D-alanylation of membrane-associated D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - 2,4-diamino-5-deaza-6-substituted pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates as potent and selective nonclassical inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  - Fifteen novel nonclassical and two classical 2,4-diamino-6-(benzylamino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates were synthesized as potential inhibitors of Pneumocystis carinii, (pc) Toxoplasma gondii, (tg) rat liver (rl), and human (h) recombinant dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR). These analogues lack a 5-methyl substitution which has been shown to be important for increased hDHFR inhibitory activity. In addition, they contain a reversal of the C9-N10 bridge present in folates and most antifolates. The synthesis of the compounds involved the reaction of 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine with the sodium salt of nitromalonaldehyde to afford the key intermediate 2,4-diamino-6-nitropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (7), in a single step. Reduction of 7 to the 2,4,6-triaminopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (8), followed by reductive amination with the appropriate benzaldehydes or phenylacetaldehydes afforded the target compounds. N9 methylation of these analogues was carried out using formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride. The analogues demonstrated significant inhibition of pcDHFR and tgDHFR. N9 methylation significantly increased DHFR inhibitory potency. Compound 11, the 3'4'5'-trimethoxy-substituted analogue with a selectivity ratio of 9.4 for tgDHFR (compared to rlDHFR) was the most selective analogue of the nonclassical series. Compound 22, the N9 methyl 2'5'-dimethoxy-substituted analogue was the most potent analogue against tgDHFR (IC 50 = 6.3 nM) and was the second most selective analogue for tgDHFR (compared to rlDHFR) in the nonclassical series. The naphthyl-substituted analogues 23-25 were generally more potent against rlDHFR than against pcDHFR and tgDHFR. Selected analogues were also evaluated against Streptococcus faecium (sf) DHFR, Escherichia coli (ec) DHFR, Lactobacillus casei (lc) DHFR and tgDHFR with hDHFR as the mammalian reference, under slightly different assay conditions than those employed for rlDHFR. Analogues 11 and 22 had selectivity ratios of greater than 100 for tgDHFR (compared to hDHFR). Analogue 22 in particular, was the most selective analogue of the nonclassical series against tgDHFR (selectivity ratio = 303.5) with excellent potency (28 nM). Analogue 11, also displayed significant selectivity for sfDHFR (selectivity ratio = 4902). Compound 22 was evaluated in vivo for the inhibition of the growth of T.gondii trophozoites in mice, where at 50 mg/kg orally, it demonstrated distinct prolongation of survival without toxicity. Compounds 11, 12 and 21-23 were evaluated as antitumor agents in the National Cancer Institutes preclinical in vitro screening program. Compounds 12, 22, and 23 showed GI50s for tumor growth inhibition in the 10 -6 - 10 -7 M range.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae MS11 folC gene.
AB  - The gene coding for folylpoly-(gamma)-glutamate synthetase (FPGS)-dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo) has been cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli folC mutant (SF4). The sequence encodes a 224-residue protein of 46.4 kDa. It shows 46% identity to the E. coli FPGS-DHFS and 29% identity to the FPGS of Lacto-bacillus casei. Sequence comparisons between the three genes reveal regions of high homology, including ATP binding sites required for bifunctionality, all of which may be important for FPGS activity. In contrast to L. casei FPGS, the E. coli and Ngo enzymes share some additional regions which may be essential for DHFS activity. The products of Ngo folC and flanking genes were monitored by T7 promoter expression. Interestingly, deletion of the upstream folI gene, which encodes a 16.5 kDa protein, abolishes the capacity of folC to complement E. coli SF4 to the wild-type phenotype. The ability to complement can be restored by folI provided in trans. Unlike folC mutants, gonococcal folI mutants are viable and display no apparent phenotype. Thus, in contrast to E. coli, Ngo folC is expressed at a sufficiently high level from its own promoter, in the absence of FolI This study provides the first insights into the genetic complexity of one-carbon metabolism in Nqo.
TI  - The potential of Lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  - Oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (Gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). The adjuvant function of different Lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. After i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high DTH responses were observed with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In different experimental model systems L. casei and L. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. A series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the L. casei L-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the Lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (Pouwels and Leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. Intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. Lactobacilli synthesizing the fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous priming.
TI  - Contribution of a salt bridge to binding affinity and dUMP orientation to catalytic rate: mutation of a substrate-binding arginine in thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Invariant arginine 179, one of four arginines that are conserved in all thymidylate synthases (TS) and that bind the phosphate moiety of the substrate 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP), can be altered even to a negatively charged glutamic acid with little effect on kcat. In the mutant structures, ordered water or the other phosphate-binding arginines compensate for the hydrogen bonds made by Arg179 in the wild-type enzyme and there is almost no change in the conformation or binding site of dUMP. Correlation of dUMP Kds for TS R179A and TS R179K with the structures of their binary complexes shows, that the positive charge on Arg179 contributes significantly to dUMP binding affinity. kcat/K(m) for dUMP measures the rate of dUMP binding to TS during the ordered bi-substrate reaction, and in the ternary complex dUMP provides a binding surface for the cofactor. kcat/K(m) reflects the ability of the enzyme to accept a properly oriented dUMP for catalysis and is less sensitive than is Kd to the changes in electrostatics at the phosphate binding site.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Thermodynamic analysis of the binding of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate to thymidylate synthase over a range of temperatures.
AB  - The binding of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) to Lactobacillus casei recombinant thymidylate synthase has been studied by isothermal titration microcalorimetry at pH 7.1 over the temperature range 16-35 degrees C. Calorimetric measurements in various buffer systems with different heats of ionization suggest that a proton uptake is involved in the binding process of the nucleotide. In the temperature range investigated, the mol protons bound/mol nucleotide increases as the temperature decreases. A model of two equal and independent sites fits well with the binding isotherms for thymidylate synthase. The binding constants, the changes in Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy/site for FdUMP binding were calculated at each temperature. The results show that the binding is driven by both enthalpy and entropy contributions in the range 16-35 degrees C. The enthalpy changes become more negative as the temperature increases, with delta Cp = -170 +/- 20 J.K-1.(mol FdUMP bound)-1. The behavior of the system supports the observation that FdUMP binds to thymidylate synthase without producing profound conformational changes in the protein dimer.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of selected lactic acid bacteria on microflora associated with  ready-to-use vegetables.
AB  - The addition of selected lactic acid bacteria strains had a remarkable inhibitory effect on the growth dynamics of microflora associated with ready-to-use vegetables, during refrigerated storage. In particular, coliforms and enterococci were strongly reduced or eliminated from the products from the third day of storage. Lactobacillus casei strains proved more effective than pediococci. The use of lactic cultures able to produce bacteriocins and to grow at low temperatures could be a useful tool to preserve fresh vegetables and to ensure their microbiological safety.
TI  - High-level expression and isotopic labeling of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate  reductase for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - Two efficient systems have been used for high-level expression of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase in Escherichia coli, including the production of protein generally and specifically labeled with 13C and 15N. A system based on T7 RNA polymerase led to the production of dihydrofolate reductase at a level of 37% of the total soluble protein of the host strain: 50 mg of pure enzyme was obtained from a 1 liter of culture (or 14 mg/g wet weight of cells). In this system, a small amount of the enzyme (less than 5%) was identified as a catalytically active 21-kDa fusion protein. Introduction of a second in-frame (ochre) stop codon did not eliminate the production of this fusion protein. The same expression system was also used to prepare dihydrofolate reductase generally labeled with 15N and to prepare single and double mutants of the enzyme. In order to have an expression system which can be used with a range of auxotrophic strains of E. coli, a system based on the tac promoter was used. This led to the production of dihydrofolate reductase at a level of 29% of total soluble protein; a yield of 40 mg enzyme per liter of culture (or 11 mg/g wet weight of cells). This system was successfully used to produce mutants of the enzyme as well as the enzyme selectively labeled with [gamma-13C]aspartic acid.
TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of varicella-zoster virus thymidylate synthase. Analysis of two highly conserved regions of the enzyme.
AB  - We have constructed a series of mutants to study the role of two structurally and functionally important regions of thymidylate synthase (TS) from varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The first centres on a conserved glycine residue in the beta-kink of beta-strand i, a partially buried region of the protein that is important for dimer interactions and the formation of the active site. We show that the glycine residue located in beta-strand i is not essential for enzyme activity and that beta-strand i can readily accommodate several amino acid substitutions and also an insertion. A covariant residue that accommodates these changes was also identified. The second region of interest was the solvent-exposed and highly mobile C-terminal residue which is an essential component of the active site in TS from Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that removal of the C-terminal residue from VZV TS does not completely inactivate the enzyme, implying that there are significant structural differences between the virus and bacterial enzymes. By combining site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling we have identified these differences and propose a model that explains the contrasting activities.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Expression of Bacillus subtilis levanase gene in Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Two Lactobacillus-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors, harbouring the levanase gene  from Bacillus subtilis under the control of its own promoter (pLPEW1) or behind the E. coli tac promoter (pESIEW2), were constructed. Lactobacillus plantarum showed the same growth characteristics on selective plates and in liquid media containing inulin, after transformation with either pLPEW1 or pESIEW2. L. plantarum transformed with pLPEW1 could be selected on inulin plates, indicating that levanase expression can be used as a food-grade selection system for Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus casei grew faster in inulin-containing medium than L. plantarum after transformation with pESIEW2, but did not grow when harbouring pLPEW1. Inulin-degrading activities of 90 mU/ml were found in culture medium of L. plantarum containing pLPEW1 or pESIEW2, and of 500 mU/ml in medium of L. casei (pESIEW2). Addition of 1 mM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside to the culture medium had no effect on growth and levanase expression in L. plantarum (pESIEW2) and L. casei (pESIEW2) strains. Levanase produced by L. casei (pESIEW2) has a size of 75 kDa and 72 kDa, corresponding to that of unprocessed and mature B. subtilis levanase, respectively, suggesting that the protein produced is recognized and processed by a signal peptidase.
TI  - Role of the active-site carboxylate in dihydrofolate reductase: kinetic and spectroscopic studies of the aspartate 26-->asparagine mutant of the Lactobacillus casei enzyme.
AB  - A mutant of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase, D26N, in which the active site aspartic acid residue has been replaced by asparagine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis has been studied by NMR and optical spectroscopy and its kinetic behavior characterized in detail. On the basis of comparisons of a large number of chemical shifts and NOEs, it is clear that there are only very slight structural differences between the methotrexate complexes of the wild-type and mutant enzymes and that these are restricted to the immediate environment of the substitution. The data suggest a slight difference in orientation of the pteridine ring in the binding site in the mutant enzyme. Both NMR and UV spectroscopy show that methotrexate is protonated on N1 when bound to the wild-type enzyme but not when bound to the mutant. Binding constant measurements by fluorescence quenching and steady-state kinetic measurements of dihydrofolate (FH2) and folate reduction show that the substitution has little or no effect on substrate, coenzyme, and inhibitor binding (< 7-fold increase in Kd) and only a modest effect on kcat (up to a factor of 9 for FH2 and 25 for folate) and kcat/KM (up to a factor of 13 for FH2 and 14 for folate). Measurements of deuterium isotope effects and direct measurements of hydride ion transfer and product release by stopped-flow methods revealed that for the mutant enzyme hydride ion transfer is rate-limiting across the pH range 5-8. This allowed a direct comparison of the rate of hydride ion transfer in the wild-type and mutant enzymes; the asparagine substitution was found to decrease this rate by 62-fold at pH 5.5 and 9-fold at pH 7.5. This effect is much smaller than that seen for the corresponding mutant of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase [Howell, E. E., Villafranca, J. E., Warren, M. S., Oatley, S. J., & Kraut, J. (1986) Science 231, 1123-1128], estimated as a 1000-fold decrease in the rate of hydride ion transfer. The change in pH dependence of kcat resulting from the substitution is consistent with, but does not prove, the idea that the group of pK 6.0 which must be protonated for hydride ion transfer to occur is Asp26. For folate reduction, the pH dependence of kcat is determined by two pKs, one of which, pK 5, disappears in the mutant enzyme, suggesting that it may correspond to ionization of Asp26.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Role of histidine 188 in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate- and divalent cation-regulated L-lactate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - A fructose 1,6-bisphosphate [Fru(1,6)P2] and divalent cation-regulated allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) (EC 1.1.1.27) of Lactobacillus casei was highly produced in Escherichia coli cells, together with its mutant enzyme, in which His-188 was replaced by Asp. Under acidic conditions, the mutant enzyme showed positive allosteric regulations by the substrate pyruvate and its analogues, like the wild-type enzyme, but not by Fru(1,6)P2, which even inhibited the stimulative effects of the alternative activation factors. In addition, Mn2+ ions also showed greatly reduced inhibitory effects on the mutant enzyme. Under neutral conditions, on the other hand, the reaction of the mutant enzyme was slightly enhanced by Fru(1,6)P2, but not further stimulated by additional Mn2+ ions, unlike the case of the wild-type enzyme. These results indicate that His-188 is, though not essential for the regulation by the alternative factors, essential for the cooperative regulation by Fru(1,6)P2 and divalent cations in L. casei L-LDH.
TI  - Complete restoration of activity to inactive mutants of Escherichia coli thymidylate synthase: evidence that E. coli thymidylate synthase is a half-the-sites activity enzyme.
AB  - Escherichia coli thymidylate synthase (TS) is a dimeric protein containing identical subunits. When R126E, an inactive mutant of this enzyme, was incubated at room temperature with other inactive mutants of E. coli, TS enzyme activity gradually reappeared. The rate of activity restoration was dependent on the mutant employed. In the case of C146W, an active site mutant, the half-time required for maximal activity restoration was about one hour, which was about 500-fold faster than that obtained with C146S. The final specific activity of the mutant mixtures, based on the concentration of R126E, was equivalent to that of the wild-type TS (WT-TS). However, when the activities of E. coli WT-TS and mutant TS mixtures were compared for their extents of renaturation following denaturation as described for Lactobacillus casei TS [Pookanjanatavip, M., Yuthavong, Y., Greene, P. J., & Santi, D. V. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 10303-10309], only about one-half of the activity of WT-TS was restored, implying that the denaturation-renaturation procedure was less efficient than allowing the native TS mutant dimers to exchange subunits. If, as proposed, subunit exchange is responsible for the observed restoration of activity to the E. coli mutant TS mixtures, it would suggest that only one active site cysteine, that provided by R126E in the dimer (R126E)-(C146W), is sufficient to yield the same kcat as WT-TS, which contains one active site cysteine in each subunit. Other mutant dimers that contain both active site cysteines such as (R126E)-(Y94A) and (R126E)-(I264Am) are also fully active, even though one of the subunits is functionally inactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Studies on bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus isolates from selected Nigerian fermented foods.
AB  - Ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) Lactobacillus isolates obtained from three Nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: Lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas cavice, Salmonella typhimurium, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Staphylococcus aureus. All the bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus were found to inhibit L. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. The antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from L. plantarum KKY12 and L. casei OGM12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. They are designated Plantacin N and Caseicin A and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. Plantacin N from L. plantarum KKY12 was active against L. plantarum, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas sobria and Aeromonas cavice whereas Caseicin A from L. casei OGM12 inhibited L. plantarum, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Caseicin A is stable at 121 degrees C/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. The bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of Lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.
TI  - Effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. The effects of growing Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. Growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the pH-dependence of zeta potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different SDS-PAGE protein profiles. For several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. The important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.
TI  - Crystal structure of thymidylate synthase from T4 phage: component of a deoxynucleoside triphosphate-synthesizing complex.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase from phage T4 (T4TS) is part of a complex of several enzymes required for coordinate DNA synthesis in infected Escherichia coli cells. It has been proposed that similar complexes of enzymes related to DNA synthesis are also functional in eukaryotes [Pardee, A. B. (1989) Science 246, 603-608]. To delineate the role of structure in the function of this complex, we have solved the structure of T4TS as a basis for mapping the complex by mutagenesis. The 3.1 A structure of the unliganded enzyme was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 19.9% for all data. Three inserts and one deletion in the coding region are unique to T4TS, and all sites lie on one side of the enzyme surface, possibly encoding unique T4 specific intermolecular interactions during the infective cycle. The crystal structure is generally in the open, unliganded conformation seen in unliganded E. coli TS, as opposed to the closed, ternary complex conformation, except that the critically important C-terminus is inserted into the active site hydrogen bonded to residue Asn85, as seen in functional ternary complex structures. Other differences between E. coli TS and T4TS appear to explain the enhanced binding of folyl polyglutamate to the latter.

TI  - Vaginal application of lactobacilli in the prophylaxis of recurrent lower urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether vaginal application of Lactobacillus casei v. rhamnosus reduces the reinfection rate in cystitis-prone women. DESIGN: A controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Division for General Practice, University of Bergen, Norway. INTERVENTION: Vaginal application of lactobacilli twice weekly. SUBJECTS: 47 women, aged 18-50 years, reporting three or more episodes of distal urinary symptoms during the previous 12 months, of which at least one episode had been medically verified as a lower UTI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The incidence rate of lower UTI during 6 months' follow-up. RESULTS: No difference in infection rate between the two groups; the incidence rate ratio between the treatment group and the placebo group was 1.41 (95% confidence interval 0.88-1.98). Lactobacilli were not found more frequently periurethrally in the treatment group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: It is still uncertain whether vaginal application of lactobacilli reduces the infection rate in cystitis-prone women.
TI  - Cloning of promoter-like sequences from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei  CG11 and their expression in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Fragments of chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CG11 (formerly Lactobacillus casei CG11) capable of functioning as promoters were isolated using the broad host range, promoter-probe vector pGKV210. Five such fragments designated P61, P79, P80, P116, and P144 were completely sequenced and analyzed. Fragment P61 had the highest transcriptional efficiency in Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus reuteri whereas P80 was the most active in Lactococcus lactis. In general, the orders of the transcriptional strengths were almost identical in E. coli and Lactobacillus reuteri but different from that in Lactococcus lactis. Mapping of the 5' end of cat mRNA showed that different regions of fragments P79 and P144 were used as promoters in Lactococcus lactis than in E. coli and Lactobacillus reuteri. Analysis of these DNA sequences revealed that the putative -35 and -10 hexanucleotides resembled those of E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and lactococci. The spacing between these two hexanucleotides and between the putative -10 hexanucleotide and the transcriptional start point (A residues predominated) ranged from 17 to 18 base pairs and from 5 to 7 base pairs, respectively. Each of the cloned Lactobacillus paracasei CG11 promoter-like fragments contained an AT-rich sequence upstream of the putative -35 region (from 60 to 73%).
TI  - Mutagenesis of the Lactobacillus casei folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene at essential residues resembling an ATP binding site.
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed on a region of the Lactobacillus casei folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) protein (residues 49 to 52), which is highly conserved when compared to the Escherichia coli and human FPGS proteins. The amino acid sequence of this region, GKGS/T, is similar to the consensus sequence for the A region of a nucleotide binding site, a motif which encodes a phosphate-binding loop. Mutation G49A or K50R, with substitution to amino acids of similar size and charge, resulted in decreases in Vmax/Km of 40- to over 100-fold, depending on the variable substrate. Alteration of G51 to S or T resulted in a large increase in the Km for glutamate. The Km for ATP was not affected more than 4-fold by any of the mutations. Our studies indicate that the conserved region is essential for FPGS function, since many of the mutations resulting in functionally conservative substitutions produced inactive enzymes. However, the mutations affected binding of all three substrates, so there is no direct evidence for involvement of the region in ATP binding.
TI  - Solution structure of bound trimethoprim in its complex with Lactobacillus casei  dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - Two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) NMR techniques have been used to assign the signals from nearly all of the protons in Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (M(r) 18,300) in its 1:1 complex with the antibacterial drug trimethoprim. A sample of uniformly 15N-labeled protein was examined using 3D 15N/1H experiments [nuclear Overhauser, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (NOESY-HMQC) and total correlation, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (TOCSY-HMQC) experiments]. Twenty-two intermolecular NOEs between trimethoprim and protein protons and four intramolecular NOEs in the ligand have been detected. Some were obtained by using heteronuclear editing and 2D HMQC-NOESY experiments on complexes formed with 15N-and 13C-labeled trimethoprim molecules ([1,3-15N2,2-amino-15N]-and [7-13C,4'-methoxy-13C]trimethoprim) bound to unlabeled protein. The ligand-protein NOEs were used as distance constraints in conjunction with minimum energy and simulated annealing calculations (carried out with X-PLOR) to dock the trimethoprim ligand into dihydrofolate reductase, using as a starting structure the crystal coordinates from a related complex with a similar overall protein structure. The restrained minimum energy calculations and the simulated annealing calculations gave 83 calculated structures with distance violations of < 0.1 A. In all of these, the two aromatic rings of trimethoprim occupied essentially the same region of conformational space in the binding site (RMSD = 0.63 A). The protein residues nearest to the bound trimethoprim were found to be very similar in all of the structures and agreed well with corresponding contact residues observed in the X-ray crystal studies on trimethoprim complexes formed with Escherichia coli and chicken liver DHFRs.
TI  - 3H-n.m.r. studies of multiple conformations and dynamic processes in complexes of folate and methotrexate with Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - [7,3',5'-3H3]- and [7,9-3H3]-folic acid and [7,3',5'-3H3]methotrexate (MTX) have  been prepared and 3H-n.m.r. spectra obtained for their complexes with Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The 3H results confirm the presence of three pH-dependent different conformational forms in the complex DHFR.NADP+.folate. The folate benzoyl ring could be shown to be in essentially the same environment in the different forms, with the major differences being associated with the pterin ring. The appearance of a single resonance for the 3',5'-tritons showed that the benzoyl ring is flipping rapidly in all three forms. In contrast, the MTX complex was shown to exist as a single conformational state with the benzoyl ring flipping rate being too low to give a single averaged signal for the 3',5'-nuclei over the temperature range 283-313 K.
TI  - Characterization and evaluation of a pta (phosphotransacetylase) negative mutant  of Escherichia coli HB101 as production host of foreign lipase.
AB  - In order to evaluate the pta(phosphotransacetylase) (-) mutant of Escherichia coli as a potential host of foreign lipase expression, the pta(-) mutant HB101 was constructed for the purpose of blocking the acetate synthetic pathway. Since acetate is known as a major inhibitory by-product of cell growth and foreign protein production, the growth characteristics and expression kinetics of the microbial lipase of the pta(-) E. coli mutant were investigated. The growth rate was considerably decreased (about 30%) when grown on M9 minimal media containing glucose, mannose or glycerol. Growth retardation was not observed when a gluconeogenic carbon source (acetate, malate or succinate) was utilized. It should be noted that the growth rate of the mutant was enhanced (about 20%) in modified M9 media including a gluconeogenic carbon source and NZ-amine. Growth inhibition of the pta(-) mutant by menadione, a representative redox-cycling drug, was more pronounced than that of the parental type of E. coli. Furthermore, the inhibition effect was more pronounced in glucose minimal medium, whereas the menadione sensitivity was not observed when a gluconeogenic carbon source was used as a sole carbon source or the lactate dehydrogenase gene from Lactobacillus casei was introduced in the pta(-) mutant. Therefore, it is suggested that the growth deficiency of the pta(-) mutant is closely related to the intracellular redox balance. When the pseudomonad lipase was expressed in the pta(-) mutant, a comparable expression rate and yield to the parental type strain was observed. High-cell-density culture of the mutant was easy to achieve even under the fluctuating conditions of residual glucose concentration.
TI  - NAD(+)-dependent D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Gene cloning and enzyme characterization.
AB  - A genomic library from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was used to complement an Escherichia coli mutant strain deficient for both lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase, and thus unable to grow anaerobically. One recombinant clone was found to display a broad specificity NAD(+)-dependent D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase activity. The corresponding gene (named hdhD) was subcloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme indicates a 333-residue protein closely related to D-2-hydroxyisocaproate (i.e. 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-pentanoate) dehydrogenase (D-HO-HxoDH) of Lactobacillus casei and other NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenases (D-LDH) from several other bacterial species. The hdhD gene was overexpressed under the control of the lambda phage PL promoter and the enzyme was purified with a two-step method. The L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus enzyme, like that of L. casei, was shown to be active on a wide variety of 2-oxoacid substrates except those having a branched beta-carbon.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Cloning, characterization and insertional inactivation of the Lactobacillus helveticus D(-) lactate dehydrogenase gene.
AB  - A plasmid, designated pSUW100, encoding the D(-)lactate dehydrogenase [D(-)-LDH;  NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28] from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 was identified from a genomic library by complementation of Escherichia coli FMJ39. The D(-)LDH gene was localized by Tn5 mutagenesis and subcloning to a 1.4-kb region of pSUW100. A 2-kb DraI fragment of pSUW100 encoding D(-)LDH activity was subcloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Analysis of this sequence identified a putative 1,014-bp D(-)LDH open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 337 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 38 kDa. The distribution of homology to the CNRZ32 D(-)LDH gene in several lactic acid bacteria was determined by Southern hybridization using an internal fragment of the D(-)LDH gene as a probe. Hybridization was detected in leuconostocs and pediococci but not in lactococci or Lactobacillus casei. An integration plasmid was constructed from pSA3 and a 0.60-kb internal fragment of the D(-)LDH gene. This plasmid was used to construct a D(-)LDH-negative derivative of L. helveticus CNRZ 32 by gene disruption; this derivative was determined as producing only L(+)lactic acid. No significant difference in growth or total lactic acid production was observed between CNRZ32 and its D(-)LDH mutant.
TI  - Partial restoration of activity to Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase following inactivation by domain deletion.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) from Lactobacillus casei has a 50 amino acid insert (residues 90-139) in the small domain that is found in only one other TS. A deletion mutant was constructed which lacked the entire insert, thereby reducing the small domain to the size found in Escherichia coli TS. This mutant did not catalyze the formation of dTMP. From the crystal structure of L. casei TS, we surmised that the loss of activity might have resulted from the exposure of residues of helices C and D, which were previously buried by the insert. To restore the local structure of helices C and D in the deletion mutants, we replaced several residues in this region by the corresponding residues found in E. coli TS. The mutant whose sequence most closely resembled that of E. coli TS carried six mutations and possessed partially restored TS activity. The mutant which had all those mutations except F87D did not catalyze any dTMP formation. The crucial role of F87D was proven in a deletion mutant which had only this change and showed greatly increased activity. All of the mutants catalyzed the debromination of BrdUMP in the absence of cofactor about as well as wild type TS. The kinetic parameters for dTMP formation of the active mutants show that the deletion has its major effect on kcat and binding of cofactor CH2H4folate, with less effect on binding of the substrate dUMP. Removal of residues 90-139 is believed to disorder helices C and D, which in turn decreases cofactor binding and catalysis.
TI  - Divergence in codon usage of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - We have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different Lactobacillus species. Codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. Both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. Codon usage in L. acidophilus is similar to that in L. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. pentosus and L. plantarum. Codon usage in the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from that in L. bulgaricus. Inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. L. bulgaricus shows GC drift, whereas all other species show AT drift. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus rarely use NNG in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. This result may be explained by assuming that L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single tRNA species for translation of family-box codons. Differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. Highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. Codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of Lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. The GC content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. The possible implications of a reduced GC content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.
TI  - Role of the D-alanyl carrier protein in the biosynthesis of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - D-Alanyl-lipoteichoic acid (D-alanyl-LTA) is a widespread macroamphiphile which plays a vital role in the growth and development of gram-positive organisms. The biosynthesis of this polymer requires the enzymic activation of D-alanine for its transfer to the membrane-associated LTA (mLTA). A small, heat-stable, and acidic protein that is required for this transfer was purified to greater than 98% homogeneity from Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469. This protein, previously named the D-alanine-membrane acceptor ligase (V. M. Reusch, Jr., and F. C. Neuhaus, J. Biol. Chem. 246:6136-6143, 1971), functions as the D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp). The amino acid composition, beta-alanine content, and N-terminal sequence of this protein are similar to those of the acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid biosynthesis. The isolation of Dcp and its derivative, D-alanyl approximately Dcp, has allowed the characterization of two novel reactions in the pathway for D-alanyl-mLTA biosynthesis: (i) the ligation of Dcp with D-alanine and (ii) the transfer of D-alanine from D-alanyl approximately Dcp to a membrane acceptor. It has not been established whether the membrane acceptor is mLTA or another intermediate in the pathway for D-alanyl-mLTA biosynthesis. Since the D-alanine-activating enzyme (EC 6.1.1.13) catalyzes the ligation reaction, this enzyme functions as the D-alanine-Dcp ligase (Dcl). Dcl also ligated the ACPs from Escherichia coli, Vibrio harveyi, and Saccharopolyspora erythraea with D-alanine. In contrast to the relaxed specificity of Dcl in the ligation reaction, the transfer of D-alanine to the membrane acceptor was highly specific for Dcp and did not occur with other ACPs. This transfer was observed by using only D-[14C]alanyl approximately Dcp and purified L. casei membranes. Thus, D-alanyl approximately Dcp is an essential intermediate in the transfer of D-alanine from Dcl to the membrane acceptor. The formation of D-alanine esters of mLTA provides a mechanism for modulating the net anionic charge in the cell wall.
TI  - Detection of alcohol-tolerant hiochi bacteria by PCR.
AB  - We report a sensitive and rapid method for detection of hiochi bacteria by PCR. This method involves the electrophoresis of amplified DNA. Nucleotide sequences of the spacer region between 16S and 23S rRNA genes of 11 Lactobacillus strains were identified by analysis of PCR products. Five primers were designed by analysis of similarities among these sequences. A single cell of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei could be detected when purified genomic DNA was used as the template. When various cell concentrations of L. casei subsp. casei were added to 50 ml of pasteurized sake and the cells were recovered, the detection limit was about one cell. No discrete band was observed in electrophoresis after PCR when human, Escherichia coli, mycoplasma, Acholeplasma, yeast, or mold DNA was used as the template.
TI  - The FNR family of transcriptional regulators.
AB  - Homologues of the transcriptional regulator FNR from Escherichia coli have been identified in a variety of taxonomically diverse bacterial species. Despite being structurally very similar, members of the FNR family have disparate regulatory roles. Those from Shewanella putrefaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Rhodopseudomonas palustris are functionally similar to FNR in that they regulate anaerobic respiration or carbon metabolism. Four rhizobial proteins (from Rhizobium meliloti, R. leguminosarum, B. japonicum and Azorhizobium caulinodans) are involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation; a fifth (from Rhizobium strain IC3342) has unknown function. Two proteins from mammalian pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis) may be involved in the regulation of toxin expression. The FNR protein of Vibrio fischeri regulates bioluminescence, and the function of the one known FNR homologue from a Gram-positive organism (Lactobacillus casei) remains to be elucidated. Some members of this family, like FNR itself, appear to function as sensors of oxygen availability, whereas others do not. The ability to sense and respond to oxygen limitation may be correlated with the presence of cysteine residues which, in the case of FNR, are thought to be involved in oxygen or redox sensing. The mechanism of DNA sequence recognition is probably conserved, or very similar, throughout this family. In a number of other Gram-negative species, there is good indirect evidence for the existence of FNR analogues; these include Alcaligenes eutrophus, A. denitrificans, A. faecalis, Paracoccus denitrificans and a number of Pseudomonas species.
TI  - 6-Phospho-beta-galactosidases of gram-positive and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B of gram-negative bacteria: comparison of structure and function by kinetic and immunological methods and mutagenesis of the lacG gene of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase of Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus casei and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B of Escherichia coli build a subfamily inside a greater enzyme family, named the glycosal hydrolase family 1, which, in addition, contains nine beta-glycosidases of different origins. Kinetic and immunological evidence is provided in this report which strengthens the relationship of the four 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases. It is shown that the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B are able to split aromatic beta-galactoside phosphates and beta-glucoside phosphates. The turnover numbers of hydrolysis of substrates with different epimerization at C-4 of the glycon vary up to 15-fold only. Two polyclonal antisera, one derived against the native 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from S. aureus and the other derived against the 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B, cross-reacted with both enzymes. Peptides of the proteins were separated by reverse phase HPLC. The cross-reacting peptides were sequenced and shown to be localized at almost the same position in the aligned primary structures of both enzymes. An insertion of nine amino acids near these antigenic domains is unique for the 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases and missing within the sequences of the beta-glycoside-specific members of the family. The lacG gene of a 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase negative S. aureus mutant was cloned into E. coli and sequenced. In the totally inactive mutant protein only the glycine at position 332 was changed to an arginine. This amino acid is part of the sequence insertion near the antigenic domain reacting with both antisera.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Catalytically active cross-species heterodimers of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a highly conserved homodimeric enzyme with two active sites, each of which contains amino acid residues from both subunits. We show that the conservation at the subunit interface between Escherichia coli TS and Lactobacillus casei TS is sufficient to permit the formation of a cross-species heterodimer between subunits of E. coli TS and L. casei TS. Heterodimer formation was monitored by the generation of catalytic activity when combinations of inactive E. coli homodimers and inactive L. casei homodimers were mixed under conditions of reversible unfolding and dissociation. The inactive L. casei mutant enzymes (Lc)C198A, (Lc)C198L, and (Lc)V316Am were tested as Arg donors to the active sites of the inactive E. coli mutant enzymes (Ec)R126Q and (Ec)R126E, while the inactive E. coli mutant enzymes (Ec)K48Q, (Ec)C146S, (Ec)R166Q, and (Ec)I264Am were tested as Arg donors to the active site of inactive (Lc)R178F. Except for (Lc)V316Am, all of the mutant enzymes tested were able to form catalytically active cross-species heterodimers. (Lc)C198A and (Ec)R126Q were cotransformed on compatible plasmids into a thymine-requiring E. coli host, and this combination was able to form sufficient active TS in vivo to support growth. Titration of (Ec)R126Q with (Lc)C198A showed that the cross-species heterodimer formed with the same probability as the intraspecies homodimers in the refolding mixture. The single active site formed by this pair has kcat and Km values similar to those of an intraspecies heterodimer.
TI  - Growth of lactobacilli, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
AB  - The growth of three lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. casei), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus 6032 and L. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. S. aureus 26003 and E. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. These mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. Among the lactobacilli, L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus grew faster than L. casei in both types of milk samples. All the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. However, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of L. casei. Pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. All the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequence analysis and partial characterization of pepN, a lysyl aminopeptidase from Lactobacillus delbruckii ssp. lactis DSM7290.
AB  - In cell extracts of Lactobacillus delbruckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 a peptidase with the ability to hydrolyse Phe-beta-naphthylamide (Phe-beta-NA) and His-beta-NA could be detected. Escherichia coli lacking the enzyme activity in an enzymic plate assay was used to screen high-copy-number and low-copy-number plasmid libraries of size-fractionated Lactobacillus DNA. Clones with the desired phenotype were detected, and the gene, designated pepN, was further subcloned and sequenced. A large open reading frame of 2529 nucleotides is predicted to encode a protein of 843 amino acids (95358 Da). Comparison of the pepN gene from Lb. delbruckii ssp. lactis DSM7290 indicates that it is homologous to genes of the family of Zn(2+)-metallohydrolases and PepN shows identity with the active centre Zn(2+)-binding motif of these enzymes. The substrate Lys-beta-NA is more effectively cleaved than Phe-beta-NA or His-beta-NA which were used for screening in E. coli. The cloned pepN gene was efficiently overexpressed in E. coli and subcloning of the gene in Lactobacillus casei resulted in a moderate overexpression of approximately 20-fold. The pepN gene product was purified from the pepN-deficient E. coli strain CM89, using the substrate Lys-p-nitroanilide (Lys-NH-Ph) in the assay procedure. In a four-step procedure including streptomycin sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration the peptidase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity.
TI  - Asparagine 229 in thymidylate synthase contributes to, but is not essential for,  catalysis.
AB  - The conserved Asn-229 (N229) of thymidylate synthase (TS, EC 2.1.1.45) provides the only side chain that directly hydrogen bonds with the pyrimidine ring of the substrate dUMP. The carboxamide moiety forms a cyclic hydrogen bond network with the NH-3 and O-4 of the base and is a prime candidate for assisting proton-transfer reactions that occur at O-4 of the pyrimidine ring of dUMP. A complete replacement set of mutants at position 229 of Lactobacillus casei TS (N229 mutants) has been prepared, purified, and characterized. Fifteen of the 19 TS mutants were catalytically active. Steady-state kinetic parameters of N229 mutants varied 17- and 115-fold in the Km values for 5,10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate and dUMP, respectively, 1000-fold in kcat values, and 10,000-fold in kcat/Km values. Wild-type TS possesses lower Km and higher kcat and kcat/Km values than any of the TS N229 mutants. We conclude that N229 contributes to, but is not essential for, binding and catalysis. When the wild-type enzyme was not considered, there were excellent correlations between log kcat and the hydrophobicity of the side chains at position 229, in which the more hydrophobic side chains showed higher values. Our results suggest a unique interaction between N229 and the substrates that seems important in appropriately positioning the uracil heterocycle for catalysis. We propose that in the absence of N229, the electrophilic catalyst that transfers protons to the O-4 and stabilizes enol intermediates is a highly conserved molecule of water.
TI  - Nonsense suppression in thymine-requiring strains of Escherichia coli is a consequence of altered folate metabolism.
AB  - Thymine-requiring strains of Escherichia coli suppress nonsense and frameshift mutants of T4 phage. We proposed that these mutants make errors during translation because of an imbalance in folate metabolism. A thymine-requiring strain grown under suppressing conditions has elevated levels of reduced folates. We tested the effect of either mutational blocks or the inhibition of various steps in folate biosynthesis on suppression. Conditions which prevent the accumulation of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate inhibit suppression, suggesting that elevated levels of this folate are required for suppression. Furthermore, conditions that result in an accumulation in dihydrofolate inhibit suppression.
TI  - Cloning and sequence determination of the valS gene, encoding valyl-tRNA synthetase in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The DNA sequence of the valS gene from Lactobacillus casei and the predicted amino acid sequence of its valyl-tRNA synthetase product have been determined. An open reading frame coding for a protein of 901 amino acids was found. A clone containing the intact L. casei valS gene functionally complemented the temperature-sensitive growth of the valS mutant strain 236c of Escherichia coli. The valS gene and the downstream folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene are transcribed in the same direction but are separated by a putative transcription terminator.

TI  - 13C NMR studies of complexes of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase formed with methotrexate and with folic acid.
AB  - 13C NMR studies of 13C-labelled ligands bound to dihydrofolate reductase provide  (DHFR) a powerful means of detecting and characterizing multiple bound conformations. Such studies of complexes of Escherichia coli DHFR with [4,7,8a,9-13C]- and [2,4a,6-13C]methotrexate (MTX) and [4,6,8a-13C]- and [2,4a,7,9-13C]folic acid confirm that in the binary complexes, MTX binds in two conformational forms and folate binds as a single conformation. Earlier studies on the corresponding complexes with Lactobacillus casei DHFR indicated that, in this case, MTX binds as a single conformation whereas folate binds in multiple conformational forms (both in its binary complex and ternary complex with NADP+); two of the bound conformational states for the folate complexes are very different from each other in that there is a 180 degrees difference in their pteridine ring orientation. In contrast, the two different conformational states observed for MTX bound to E. coli DHFR do not show such a major difference in ring orientation and bind with N1 protonated in both forms. The major difference appears to involve the manner in which the 4-NH2 group of MTX binds to the enzyme (although the same protein residues are probably involved in both interactions). Addition of either NADP+ or NADPH to the E. coli DHFR-MTX complex results in a single set of 13C signals for bound methotrexate consistent with only one conformational form in the ternary complexes.
TI  - Expression cloning of a human cDNA encoding folylpoly(gamma-glutamate) synthetase and determination of its primary structure.
AB  - A human cDNA for folypoly(gamma-glutamate) synthetase [FPGS; tetrahydrofolate:L-glutamate gamma-ligase (ADP forming), EC 6.3.2.17] has been cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli folC mutant. The cDNA encodes a 545-residue protein of M(r) 60,128. The deduced sequence has regions that are highly homologous to peptide sequences obtained from purified pig liver FPGS and shows limited homology to the E. coli and Lactobacillus casei FPGSs. Expression of the cDNA in E. coli results in elevated expression of an enzyme with characteristics of mammalian FPGS. Expression of the cDNA in AUXB1, a mammalian cell lacking FPGS activity, overcomes the cell's requirement for thymidine and purines but does not overcome the cell's glycine auxotrophy, consistent with expression of the protein in the cytosol but not the mitochondria.
TI  - Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacR, lacABCD, and lacFE genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of lacRABCDF and partial nucleotide sequence of lacE from the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans are presented. Comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. The deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of Lactobacillus casei. Additionally, LacR has sequence homology with the repressor (DeoR) of the Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while LacC is similar to phosphokinases (FruK and PfkB) from E. coli. The primary translation products of the lacRABCDFE genes are polypeptides of 251 (M(r) 28,713), 142 (M(r) 15,610), 171 (M(r) 18,950), 310 (M(r) 33,368), 325 (M(r) 36,495), 104 (M(r) 11,401), and 123 (NH2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. As inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (LacR), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (LacA and LacB), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (LacC), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (LacD), and the sugar-specific components enzyme III-lactose (LacF) and enzyme II-lactose (LacE) of the S. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the S. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of S. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.
TI  - Isolation and complete sequence of the purL gene encoding FGAM synthase II in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The purL gene from Lactobacillus casei, encoding phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase II involved in the de novo synthesis of purines, was cloned and sequenced. The putative purL product of 741 amino acids (M(r) of 79,575) shows 25% and 53% identity to the homologous enzymes from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. In addition, partial sequences of two other pur genes (purQ and purF) and a possible third gene (purC) were obtained. All these genes are organized in an operon similar to that of B. subtilis. In contrast, the corresponding genes from E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium are scattered through the genome.
TI  - Prevention of 5-fluorouracil-induced infection with indigenous Escherichia coli in tumor-bearing mice by nonspecific immunostimulation.
AB  - We have previously reported that the lethal toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in  specific-pathogen-free mice is due to an indigenous infection with Escherichia coli (K. Nomoto, T. Yokokura, Y. Yoshikai, et al. Can. J. Microbiol. 37:244-247, 1991). In the present study, we demonstrate that nonspecific immunostimulation augments host resistance against the lethal toxicity of 5-FU in tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous administration of a preparation of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (LC 9018), a nonspecific immunostimulant, at a dose of 20 mg/kg to BALB/c mice augmented their resistance against the lethal toxicity of 5-FU if the preparation was injected into the mice 10-40 days before administration of 5-FU. Injection of LC 9018 into BALB/c mice bearing Meth A fibrosarcoma also enhanced their resistance against the lethality of 5-FU. Systemic infection with E. coli was induced in all of the 5-FU-treated tumor-bearing mice 10 days or more after administration of the drug at a lethal dose of 500 mg/kg, and it was accompanied by an overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestine. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with LC 9018 resulted in decreased rates of occurrence of systemic infection with E. coli and inhibition of overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestine after administration of 5-FU. A single administration of either LC 9018 or 5-FU significantly inhibited the growth of Meth A cells in vivo, and a combined antitumor effect was shown in the mice treated with both 5-FU and LC 9018.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of two cryptic plasmids from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353 and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014.
AB  - The DNA sequences of a 2.4 kb plasmid (p353-2) from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353  and a 1.9 kb plasmid (p8014-2) from Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 show 81.5% overall similarity. Both plasmids carry elements (replication protein gene, plus-origin and minus-origin of replication), which are typical of plasmids that replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism of replication (RCR). Direct evidence for an RCR mechanism was obtained by showing the accumulation of single-stranded plasmid intermediates in the presence of rifampicin. A minus-origin of replication was defined for plasmids p353-2 and p8014-2 based on DNA sequence analysis and on its ability to convert single-stranded into double-stranded plasmid DNA. Plasmids pLPE323, pLPE350 and pLPC37 that are derived from the p353-2 or p8014-2 replicon are structurally and segregationally stable in L. pentosus MD353, L. plantarum ATCC 8014 and in Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393. The presence of Escherichia coli or lambda DNA fragments in vectors derived from p353-2 or p8014-2 does not affect the structural stability but results in segregational instability of the vectors. The instability increases with increasing size of the inserted DNA fragment. Since vectors based on these replicons can be efficiently propagated in a wide variety of Lactobacillus species, they are highly suitable for cloning and expression of foreign DNA in Lactobacillus, provided that selective pressure is applied.
TI  - Thymidylate synthase with a C-terminal deletion catalyzes partial reactions but is unable to catalyze thymidylate formation.
AB  - The V316Am mutant of Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase has a single amino  acid deletion at the C-terminus which abolishes catalysis of dTMP formation. However, V316Am catalyzes two partial reactions which require covalent catalysis: a CH2H4folate-dependent exchange of the 5-hydrogen of dUMP for protons in water and a thiol-dependent dehalogenation of 5-bromo- and 5-iodo-dUMP. These reactions proceed with kcat and Km values similar to those of the wild-type TS-catalyzed reactions. dUMP, dTMP, and FdUMP are competitive inhibitors of the debromination reaction with Ki values similar to those obtained with wild-type enzyme. These results show that removal of the terminal valine does not alter the ability of the enzyme to bind to or form covalent bonds with nucleotide ligands. V316Am also forms a covalent ternary complex with FdUMP and CH2H4folate. However, the affinity of the TS-FdUMP complex for the cofactor is reduced, and the rate of covalent ternary complex formation and its stability are significantly lower than with wild-type TS. These results allow us to place the major defects of the mutation on steps that occur subsequent to initial CH2H4folate binding.
TI  - Complete replacement set of amino acids at the C-terminus of thymidylate synthase: quantitative structure-activity relationship of mutants of an enzyme.
AB  - The C-terminal residue of thymidylate synthase (TS) is highly conserved and has been implicated in cofactor binding, catalysis, and a conformational change. The codon for the C-terminal valine of Lactobacillus casei TS has been replaced with those for 19 other amino acids and the amber stop codon. Fourteen of the resulting mutant proteins were active by genetic complementation using a Thy- strain of Escherichia coli, and 18 mutants were active by in vitro assay. Only the aspartate and amber mutations had undetectable activity. All of the mutants were expressed at high levels (5-30% of soluble protein) and were purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. In general, the alterations at position 316 led to little effect on the Km for dUMP, an increase in Km for the folate cofactor, and a decrease in kcat. The observations show that TS can tolerate the substitution of most amino acids for valine at the C-terminus without a complete loss of activity, that hydrophobic substitutions are preferred, and that the C-terminal side chain is involved in both cofactor binding and catalysis. There was an excellent correlation between log kcat and hydrophobicity of the side chain at position 316 and an inverse correlation between log Km and the hydrophobicity of this residue. Kinetic parameters of the cofactor-independent TS-catalyzed dehalogenation of BrdUMP showed no variation with the side chain at position 316. In context of the structure of TS, it is proposed that binding of the cofactor triggers a conformational change in which the C-terminal side chain undergoes hydrophobic interactions that stabilize a rate-limiting transition state of the TS reaction.
TI  - Construction and characterization of shuttle plasmids for lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The chimeric plasmid pBN183 was first constructed in Escherichia coli by ligating the BamHI-digested E. coli plasmid pBR322 and a Bg/II-linearized streptococcal plasmid, pNZ18. The pBN183 transformed E. coli to ApR at a frequency of (8.2 +/- 1.2) x 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/microgram DNA. Electrotransformation of Streptococcus thermophilus with pBN183 yielded CmR, ApS clones at a frequency of (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(1) CFU/microgram DNA. Plasmid screening with pBN183-transformed S. thermophilus clones revealed that ca. 70% of these transformants contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid pBN183A, a pBN183 deletion mutant lacking one copy of a tandemly arranged, highly homologous DNA sequence, was isolated for further study. It transformed E. coli to ApR and S. thermophilus to CmR with frequencies of (4.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(5) and (8.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA, respectively. Screening of S. thermophilus transformants did not show the presence of deleted plasmids. Based on the structure of pBN183A, a new shuttle plasmid, pDBN183, was constructed from pBN183 by removal of the small (1.2 kb) Sa/I fragment. Transformation frequencies of pDBN183 were (5.0 +/- 1.3) x 10(5) and (4.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA with E. coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In contrast to the parent pBN183, only 17% of the pDBN183-transformed S. thermophilus contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid copy numbers of the three vectors in E. coli were estimated at 17-18 per chromosome. The three plasmids conferred ApR and CmR to E. coli, but only CmR to S. thermophilus. The insertion of a Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) into pDBN183 did not affect the plasmid's stability in Lactobacillus casei, but resulted in deletion of the recombinant DNA in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Biosynthesis of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid: cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of the Lactobacillus casei gene for the D-alanine-activating enzyme.
AB  - The D-alanine-activating enzyme (Dae; EC 6.3.2.4) encoded by the dae gene from Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 is a cytosolic protein essential for the formation of the D-alanyl esters of membrane-bound lipoteichoic acid. The gene has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli, an organism which does not possess Dae activity. The open reading frame is 1,518 nucleotides and codes for a protein of 55.867 kDa, a value in agreement with the 56 kDa obtained by electrophoresis. A putative promoter and ribosome-binding site immediately precede the dae gene. A second open reading frame contiguous with the dae gene has also been partially sequenced. The organization of these genetic elements suggests that more than one enzyme necessary for the biosynthesis of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid may be present in this operon. Analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the dae gene identified three regions with significant homology to proteins in the following groups of ATP-utilizing enzymes: (i) the acid-thiol ligases, (ii) the activating enzymes for the biosynthesis of enterobactin, and (iii) the synthetases for tyrocidine, gramicidin S, and penicillin. From these comparisons, a common motif (GXXGXPK) has been identified that is conserved in the 19 protein domains analyzed. This motif may represent the phosphate-binding loop of an ATP-binding site for this class of enzymes. A DNA fragment (1,568 nucleotides) containing the dae gene and its putative ribosome-binding site has been subcloned and expressed in E. coli. Approximately 0.5% of the total cell protein is active Dae, whereas 21% is in the form of inclusion bodies. The isolation of this minimal fragment without a native promoter sequence provides the basis for designing a genetic system for modulating the D-alanine ester content of lipoteichoic acid.
TI  - Mutation of asparagine 229 to aspartate in thymidylate synthase converts the enzyme to a deoxycytidylate methylase.
AB  - The conserved Asn 229 of thymidylate synthase (TS) forms a cyclic hydrogen bond network with the 3-NH and 4-O of the nucleotide substrate dUMP. The Asn 229 to Asp mutant of Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase (TS N229D) has been prepared, purified, and investigated. Steady-state kinetic parameters of TS N229D show 3.5- and 10-fold increases in the Km values of CH2H4folate and dUMP, respectively, and a 1000-fold decrease in kcat. Most important, the Asp 229 mutation changes the substrate specificity of TS to an enzyme which recognizes and methylates dCMP in preference to dUMP. With TS N229D the Km for dCMP is bout 3-fold higher than for dUMP, and the Km for CH2H4folate is increased about 5-fold; however, the kcat for dCMP methylation is 120-fold higher than that for dUMP methylation. Specificity for dCMP versus dUMP, as measured by kcat/Km, changes from negligible with wild-type TS to about a 40-fold increase with TS N229D. TS N229D reacts with CH2H4folate and FdUMP or FdCMP to form ternary complexes which are analogous to the TS-FdUMP-CH2H4folate complex. From what is known of the mechanism and structure of TS, the dramatic change in substrate specificity of TS N229D is proposed to involve a hydrogen bond network between Asp 229 and the 3-N and 4-NH2 of the cytosine heterocycle, causing protonation of the 3-N and stabilization of a reactive imino tautomer. A similar mechanism is proposed for related enzymes which catalyze one-carbon transfers to cytosine heterocycles.
TI  - Purification and crystallization of Lactobacillus casei folylpolyglutamate synthetase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) from Lactobacillus casei has been crystallized with polyethylene glycol and acetate buffer at pH 5.0. The enzyme was obtained from Escherichia coli strain SF4 harboring the L. casei FPGS chromosomal gene on a pEMBL vector (pGT3-8.1). Crystals of the enzyme were obtained which diffract to 2.6 A resolution. The crystals are monoclinic, space group P2(1), with unit cell dimensions of a = 54.07 A, b = 45.83 A, c = 84.37 A and beta = 107.92 degrees. A unit cell contains one molecule of the 43,000 Da enzyme per asymmetric unit. A complete X-ray data set on the native crystals has been collected.
TI  - Evolutionary relationship of NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase: comparison of primary structure of 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases.
AB  - A comparison of the primary structures of NAD(+)-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase with L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-malate dehydrogenase failed to show any sequence similarity. However, D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus casei, glycerate dehydrogenase from cucumber, D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and erythronate 4-phosphate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli showed 38%, 24%, 24% and 22% amino acid identity, respectively. The profile analysis of the aligned sequences confirmed their relatedness. The hydropathy profiles of the aligned dehydrogenases were almost identical between residues 100-300 indicating largely preserved folding patterns of their polypeptide chains. The data suggest that L- and D-specific 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase genes evolved from two different ancestors and thus represent two different sets of enzyme families.
TI  - Cloning, sequence, and phenotypic expression of katA, which encodes the catalase  of Lactobacillus sake LTH677.
AB  - Lactobacillus sake LTH677 is a strain, isolated from fermented sausage, which forms a heme-dependent catalase. This rare property is highly desirable in sausage fermentation, as it prevents rancidity and discoloration caused by hydrogen peroxide. A gene bank containing MboI fragments of chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus sake LTH677 in Escherichia coli plasmid pBR328 was constructed. The catalase gene was cloned by heterologous complementation of the Kat- phenotype of E. coli UM2. The catalase structural gene, designated katA, was assigned to a 2.3-kb region by deletion analysis of the originally cloned fragment in plasmid pHK1000. The original chromosomal arrangement was determined by Southern hybridization. Protein analysis revealed that the catalase subunit has a molecular size of 65,000 Da and that the active catalase possesses a hexameric structure. The molecular size of the subunit deduced from the nucleotide sequence was determined to 54,504 Da. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 65,000-Da protein corresponded to the one deduced from the DNA sequence. After recloning of katA in the E. coli-Lactococcus shuttle vector pGKV210, the gene was successfully transferred and phenotypically expressed in Lactobacillus casei, which is naturally deficient in catalase activity.
TI  - Replacement of the folC gene, encoding folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase in Escherichia coli, with genes mutagenized in vitro.
AB  - The folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase gene (folC) in Escherichia coli was deleted from the bacterial chromosome and replaced by a selectable Kmr marker. The deletion strain required a complementing gene expressing folylpolyglutamate synthetase encoded on a plasmid for viability, indicating that folC is an essential gene in E. coli. The complementing folC gene was cloned into the vector pPM103 (pSC101, temperature sensitive for replication), which segregated spontaneously at 42 degrees C in the absence of selection. This complementing plasmid was replaced in the folC deletion strain by compatible pUC plasmids containing folC genes with mutations generated in vitro, producing strains which express only mutant folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Mutant folC genes expressing insufficient enzyme activity could not complement the chromosomal deletion, resulting in retention of the pPM103 plasmid. Some mutant genes expressing low levels of enzyme activity replaced the complementing plasmid, but the strains produced were auxotrophic for products of folate-dependent pathways. The folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene from Lactobacillus casei, which may lack dihydrofolate synthetase activity, replaced the complementing plasmid, but the strain was auxotrophic for all folate end products.
TI  - Prevention of indigenous infection of mice with Escherichia coli by nonspecific immunostimulation.
AB  - We have previously reported that the lethal toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in  specific-pathogen-free mice is due to an intestinal infection with indigenous Escherichia coli induced by the drug (K. Nomoto, T. Yokokura, Y. Yoshikai, M. Mitsuyama, and K. Nomoto, Can J. Microbiol. 37:244-247, 1991). In the present study we demonstrate that nonspecific immunostimulation is effective in the protection of mice from the lethal indigenous infection induced by 5-FU. Intravenous or subcutaneous injection of a preparation of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018, a potent nonspecific immunostimulant, into BALB/c mice reduced the lethal toxicity of 5-FU at doses ranging from 338 to 800 mg/kg of body weight if YIT 9018 was injected 7 to 40 days before administration of 5-FU. Systemic infection with E. coli developed in all of the 5-FU-treated control mice 7 days or more after administration of 5-FU in large doses and was accompanied by overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestinal tract. Pretreatment of mice with YIT 9018 resulted in a decreased occurrence of systemic infection with E. coli to levels of 0 to 20% and no significant changes in the population levels of E. coli in the intestinal tract during the 14 days after administration of 5-FU. The levels of leukopenia in the spleen and peripheral blood were lower, and recovery of granulocyte-macrophage precursor cells in the spleen and femur began earlier in the treated animals than in the 5-FU-treated controls. Intravenous transfusion of syngeneic normal bone marrow cells or spleen cells into the mice at an early period after administration of 5-FU diminished markedly the occurrence of the lethal indigenous infection, suggestion that an earlier recovery from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is important in the mechanisms of protection of the host from the infection.
TI  - Distribution of an L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  - A protein carboxyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues. A similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. In this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. DNA probes from the E. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal DNA of the enteric species. Interestingly, no activity was found in the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in Rhizobium meliloti or Rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. Additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species Bacillus subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces griseus. The absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence of inhibitors in the extracts. These results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. Since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal cellular physiology.
TI  - Purification and substrate specificity of a T4 phage intron-encoded endonuclease.
AB  - The T4 phage td intron-encoded endonuclease (I-Tev I) cleaves the intron-deleted  td gene (td delta I) 23 nucleotides upstream of the intron insertion site on the noncoding strand and 25 nucleotides upstream of this site on the coding strand, to generate a 2-base hydroxyl overhang in the 3' end of each DNA strand. I-Tev I-157, a truncated form in which slightly more than one third (88 residues) of the endonuclease is deleted, was purified to homogeneity and shown to possess endonuclease activity similar to that of I-TEV I, the full-length enzyme (245 residues). The minimal length of the td delta I gene that was cleaved by I-Tev I and I-Tev I-157 has been determined to be exactly 39 basepairs, from -27 (upstream in exon1) to +12 (downstream in exon2) relative to the intron insertion site. Similar to the full-length endonuclease, I-Tev I-157 cuts the intronless thymidylate synthase genes from such diverse organisms as Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and the human. The position and nature of the in vitro endonucleolytic cut in these genes are homologous to those in td delta I. Point mutational analysis of the td delta I substrate based on the deduced consensus nucleotide sequence has revealed a very low degree of specificity on either side of the cleavage site, for both the full-length and truncated I-TEV I.
TI  - Structural similarity and distribution of small cryptic plasmids of Lactobacillus curvatus and L. sake.
AB  - Plasmid profiles of strains of Lactobacillus curvatus and L. sake isolated from meat or sauerkraut were analysed to investigate plasmid homology and distribution in relation to the ecology of these organisms in fermenting foods. A hybridisation probe was constructed by cloning of pLc2, a cryptic, 2.6-kbp plasmid from L. curvatus LTH683, into the Escherichia coli plasmid pRV50. In Southern hybridisations with the digoxygenine labeled pLc2 probe, pLc2-related small plasmids were frequently detected in meat-borne strains of L. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum, L. curvatus, L. sake, L. alimentarius, L. farciminis and L. halotolerans and in L. curvatus and L. sake isolated from sauerkraut. Among 27 Lactobacillus type strains originally isolated from habitats other than meat this type of homology was detected only with plasmids of L. buchneri and L. mali. Restriction-enzyme mapping of six small cryptic plasmids from L. curvatus and L. sake revealed strong structural homology but no similarity to previously characterized plasmids of lactobacilli. The presence of a variable region in addition to a conserved one and the occurrence of deletions during cloning of pLc2 suggest that vectors derived from these plasmids are likely to be structurally unstable.
TI  - Shuttle plasmid vectors for Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli with a minus origin.
AB  - Recombinant plasmids which can be used as shuttle vectors between Escherichia coli and the industrially used strains of Lactobacillus casei were constructed. They have replication regions closely related to those of pUB110 and are likely to replicate by a rolling-circle mechanism via a plus-strand-specific DNA intermediate in L. casei. Both orientations of palA from the staphylococcal plasmid pC194 and those of the intergenic region from coliphage M13 are identified as active minus origins in L. casei, in contrast to the pAM alpha 1 delta 1-derived BA3 minus origin which does not function in L. casei. Stability of the plasmids increased in L. casei when one of these two active minus origins was inserted. All the DNA sequences of the constructed vectors were known.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activity of oral Lactobacillus casei: influence of dose on the secretory immune response and protective capacity in intestinal infections.
AB  - Lactobacilli, often used as effectors of host functions, could play an important  role in maintaining human health by controlling other intestinal microorganisms capable of producing harmful effects. Using an experimental model, we studied the effect of different oral doses of Lactobacillus casei on the secretory IgA response and the protective capacity of the microorganism in preventing intestinal infections. The optimization of the protective dose of Lb. casei by previous feeding and the use of the lactobacillus as an immunological way to control enteric infections were investigated. We found that conventional mice were protected against infection with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli by previous feeding for 2 consecutive days with a daily Lb. casei dose of 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/mouse. Previous feeding for 7 d proved less effective, and feeding for 5 d afforded no protection at all. We were also able to demonstrate that the protective effect of Lb. casei against Sal. typhimurium and Esch. coli was connected mainly with the high level of IgA antipathogen antibodies present in intestinal secretions. beta-Glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) and beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) activities, measured both in the intestinal fluid and histological samples, showed a marked increase in intestinal inflammatory response on day 5 of feeding. These results show that Lb. casei plays an important role in the prevention of enteric infections, a low dose being enough for protection against intestinal infections by increasing IgA secretion into the intestinal lumen, thus providing adequate defences for the mucosal surface. A previously administered dose of this magnitude could therefore be used as an oral adjuvant in preventing enteric infections.
TI  - Organization and characterization of three genes involved in D-xylose catabolism  in Lactobacillus pentosus.
AB  - A cluster of three genes involved in D-xylose catabolism (viz. xylose genes) in Lactobacillus pentosus has been cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. The deduced gene products show considerable sequence similarity to a repressor protein involved in the regulation of expression of xylose genes in Bacillus subtilis (58%), to E. coli and B. subtilis D-xylose isomerase (68% and 77%, respectively), and to E. coli D-xylulose kinase (58%). The cloned genes represent functional xylose genes since they are able to complement the inability of a L. casei strain to ferment D-xylose. NMR analysis confirmed that 13C-xylose was converted into 13C-acetate in L. casei cells transformed with L. pentosus xylose genes but not in untransformed L. casei cells. Comparison with the aligned amino acid sequences of D-xylose isomerases of different bacteria suggests that L. pentosus D-xylose isomerase belongs to the same similarity group as B. subtilis and E. coli D-xylose isomerase and not to a second similarity group comprising D-xylose isomerases of Streptomyces violaceoniger, Ampullariella sp. and Actinoplanes. The organization of the L. pentosus xylose genes, 5'-xylR (1167 bp, repressor) - xylA (1350 bp, D-xylose isomerase) - xylB (1506 bp, D-xylulose kinase) - 3' is similar to that in B. subtilis. In contrast to B. subtilis xylR, L. pentosus xylR is transcribed in the same direction as xylA and xylB.
TI  - Cloning of the D-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus by complementation in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A strain of Escherichia coli (FMJ144) deficient for pyruvate formate lyase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was complemented with a genomic DNA library from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. One positive cloned showed LDH activity and production of D(-)lactate was demonstrated. The nucleotide sequence of the D-LDH gene (ldhA) revealed the spontaneous insertion of an E. coli insertion sequence IS2 upstream of the gene coding region. The open reading frame encoded a 333-amino acid protein, showing no similarity with known L-LDH sequences but closely related to L. casei D-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (D-HicDH).
TI  - [An electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  - Transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei and Edwardsiella tarda. Different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. For the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses by E. coli indigenous strains M-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. This observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenase  gene.
AB  - An allosteric L-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 was cloned in Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined. The gene was composed of an open reading frame of 981 bp, starting with a GTG codon and ending with a TAA codon. The sequences for the promoter and ribosome binding site were identified, and a sequence for a structure resembling a rho-independent transcription terminator was also found.
TI  - D-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of the D-isomer-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family. Cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of the D-lactate dehydrogenase gene of Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - The gene encoding D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-lactate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) of Lactobacillus plantarum has been sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5'-noncoding region of the gene was replaced with the tac promoter. Comparison of the sequence of D-lactate dehydrogenase with L-lactate dehydrogenases, including the L. plantarum L-lactate dehydrogenase, showed no significant homology. In contrast, the D-lactate dehydrogenase is homologous to E. coli D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and Lactobacillus casei D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. This indicates that D-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of a new family of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases recently proposed, being distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase and L-malate dehydrogenase, and strongly suggests that the new family consists of D-isomer-stereospecific enzymes. In the reductive reaction, the enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity, although pyruvate was the most favorable of all 2-ketocarboxylic acids tested. In particular, hydroxypyruvate is effectively reduced by the enzyme, the reaction rate, and Km value being comparable to those in the case of pyruvate, indicating that the enzyme has not only D-lactate dehydrogenase activity but also D-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. The conserved residues in this family appear to be the residues involved in the substrate binding and the catalytic reaction, and thus to be targets for site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - Production of mutant dihydrofolate reductases of Lactobacillus casei for nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - Seven mutations (L4P, W21L, D26E, D26N, R57H, R57K and T63Q) affecting residues of dihydrofolate reductase of Lactobacillus casei, suspected of being important in substrate, inhibitor, or cofactor binding, were made by gapped-duplex site-directed mutagenesis. Expression of the L. casei dhfr gene required the removal of nucleotide sequences flanking the coding region. Temperature-inducible expression from the lambda pL promoter of plasmid pPLc28 allowed synthesis and subsequent affinity purification of five mutant proteins in amounts and purity sufficient for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis (100 mg or more) from 10-liter cultures. W21L required the growth of 40-liter batches, and L4P was not found. Using a two-plasmid system with pcI857 providing lambda repressor and pMAC5-14 expressing the mutant gene, any auxotrophic strain of Escherichia coli can be used as a host, allowing isotopic labelling of each amino acid of any protein for rapid NMR peak assignment.
TI  - Staphylococcal lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: site-specific mutagenesis on the lacE gene gives evidence that a cysteine residue is responsible for phosphorylation.
AB  - The lactose-specific phosphocarrier protein enzyme II of the bacterial phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Staphylococcus aureus was modified by site-specific mutagenesis on the corresponding lacE gene in order to replace the histidine residues 245, 274 and 510 and the cysteine residue 476 of the amino acid sequence with a serine residue. The wild-type and mutant genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene products were characterized in different in vitro test systems. In vitro phosphorylation studies on mutant derivatives of the lactose-specific enzyme II led to the conclusion that cysteine residue 476 is the active-site for phosphorylation of this enzyme II by a phospho-enzyme III of the same sugar specificity. A cysteine residue phosphorylated intermediate was first postulated for the mannitol-specific enzyme II of E. coli and studies performed independently concerning the lactose-specific enzyme II of Lactobacillus casei are in agreement with the above results.
TI  - The possible role of probiotics as dietary antimutagen.
AB  - Possible antimutagenic actions of probiotics--mainly lactic acid bacteria--were examined using in vitro and in vivo test systems. In the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA1538 beef extract and nitrosated beef extract were used as mutagens. L. casei showed high antimutagenic activity on mutagenicity induced by nitrosated beef extract only without S9 mix, whereas Omniflora (a lyophilized preparation of lactobacilli and E. coli) and its cell-free culture broth exhibited antimutagenic action only on beef extract. The actions of probiotics were more homogeneous when living animals were used in the tests. Using busulfan as a mutagen both the chromosome aberration test (with Chinese hamster bone marrow cells) and the micronucleus test (with bone marrow cells of Chinese hamsters and mice) showed strong anticlastogenic action when L. casei, Omniflora or yoghurt (with living bifiobacteria) were given orally at the same time as the mutagen. Lactobacilli were effective also after i.p. injection. Cell-free culture broths had no or only weak antimutagenic effects. Mutagen-induced chromosome aberrations and micronuclei were reduced by up to 80% by the lactobacilli.
TI  - Impact on catalysis of secondary structural manipulation of the alpha C-helix of  Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The alpha C-helix of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase has been converted  to its counterpart in Lactobacillus casei by a triple mutation in the helix (H45R, W47Y, and I50F). These changes result in a 2-fold increase in the steady-state reaction rate (kcat = 26 s-1) that is limited by an increased off rate for the release of tetrahydrofolate (koff = 40 s-1 versus 12 s-1). On the other hand the mutant protein exhibits a 10-fold increase in the KM value (6.8 microM) for dihydrofolate and a 10-fold decrease in the rate of hydride transfer (85 s-1) from NADPH to dihydrofolate. The elevated rate of tetrahydrofolate release upon the rebinding of NADPH, a characteristic of the wild-type enzyme-catalyzed reaction, is diminished. The intrinsic pKa (6.4) of the mutant enzyme binary complex with NADPH is similar to that of the wild type, but the pKa of the ternary complex is increased to 7.3, about on pH unit higher than the wild-type value. Further mutagenesis (G51P and an insertion of K52) was conducted to incorporate a hairpin turn unique to the C-terminus of the alpha C-helix of the L. casei enzyme in order to adjust a possible dislocation of the new helix. The resultant pentamutant enzyme shows restoration of many of the kinetic parameters, such as kcat (12 s-1), KM (1.1 microM for dihydrofolate), and khyd (526 s-1), to the wild-type values. The synergism in the product release is also largely restored. A substrate-induced conformational change responsible for the fine tuning of the catalytic process was found to be associated with the newly installed hairpin structure. The Asp27 residue of the mutant enzyme was found to be reprotonated before tetrahydrofolate release.
TI  - On the optimization of hydrophobic and hydrophilic substituent interactions of 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted-benzyl)pyrimidines with dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The inhibition constants (Kiapp) were obtained from the action of 68 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted-benzyl)pyrimidines on dihydrofolate reductase from an Escherichia coli strain MB 1428. Subsequently, these results were used to formulate appropriate quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Once again these equations emphasize the paramount importance of steric/dispersion factors in enhancing antibacterial potency. Hydrophobicity also plays a role, albeit a minor one. Comparisons with the QSAR obtained versus prokaryotic dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) demonstrate subtle differences in binding behavior between meta and para substituents which may be effectively maximized in the design of more efficacious and selective antibacterial agents. The bacterial and avian QSAR equations can be used to calculate selectivity indices for trimethoprim, tetroxoprim, and two other specially designed 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted-benzyl)pyrimidines.
TI  - Molecular cloning and DNA sequence of lacE, the gene encoding the lactose-specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system of Lactobacillus casei. Evidence that a cysteine residue is essential for sugar phosphorylation.
AB  - The gene coding for the lactose-specific Enzyme II of the Lactobacillus casei phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, lacE, has been isolated by molecular cloning and expressed in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of the lacE gene and the deduced amino acid sequence are presented. The putative translation product comprises a hydrophobic protein of 577 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 62,350 Da. The deduced polypeptide has a high degree of sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose-specific enzymes II of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis. The sequence surrounding cysteine 483 was strongly conserved in the three proteins. The identity of the lacE product as the Enzyme IIlacL.casei was demonstrated by in vitro lactose phosphorylation assays using the protein expressed in E. coli. Single replacement of each of the histidine and cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis pointed to cysteine 483 as an amino acid residue essential for the phosphoryl group transfer reaction.
TI  - Characterization of the lactose-specific enzymes of the phosphotransferase system in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded lactose genes of the Lactococcus lactis phosphotransferase system encoding Enzyme IIIlac (lacF) and Enzyme IIlac (lacE) have been identified and cloned in Escherichia coli and L. lactis. Nucleotide sequence and transcription analysis showed that these genes are organized into a lactose-inducible operon with the gene order lacF-lacE-lacG-lacX, the latter two genes encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase and a 34-kDa protein with an unknown function, respectively. The lac-operon is immediately followed by an IS element that is homologous to ISS1. Enzyme IIIlac was purified from L. lactis and determination of its NH2-terminal sequence demonstrated that the lacF gene starts with a TTG codon and encodes a 105 amino acid protein (Mr = 11416). Cross-linking studies with the purified enzyme showed that Enzyme IIIlac is active as a trimer. A mutant lacF gene was identified in strain YP2-5 and appeared to encode Enzyme IIIlac containing the missense mutation G18E. The lacF gene could be expressed under control of vector-located promoter sequences resulting in overproduction of Enzyme IIIlac in E. coli and complementation of the L. lactis lacF mutant YP2-5. The deduced amino acid sequence of Enzyme IIlac consists of 586 amino acids (Mr = 61562) and shows the characteristics of a hydrophobic, integral membrane protein. The deduced primary structures of the L. lactis Enzyme IIIlac and Enzyme IIlac are homologous to those of Staphylococcus aureus (72 and 71% identity, respectively) and Lactobacillus casei (48 and 47% identity, respectively). In contrast, the organization of the lactose genes differs significantly between those Gram-positive bacteria. Heterogramic homology in specific domains was observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the lactose-specific enzymes and that of E. coli Enzyme IIIcel and Enzyme IIcel, which suggest a common function in the transport and phosphorylation of these structurally related beta-glucosides.
TI  - Saturation site-directed mutagenesis of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - We have subjected 12 different codons of a synthetic Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase (TS) gene to saturation site-directed mutagenesis to create amino acid "replacement sets" at each of those positions. The target residues were chosen because they are highly conserved and because they are important for the structure and function of the protein as indicated by solution and structural studies. The mutagenesis procedure involved excision of a fragment of the synthetic gene containing the target codon, followed by its replacement with a mixture of oligonucleotides which code for all 20 amino acids and the amber stop codon. TS mutants were identified by DNA sequencing, and catalytically active mutants were identified by genetic complementation using a Thy- strain of Escherichia coli. Only 3 of the 12 target amino acids examined were essential for TS activity; and of the 125 total mutants identified, 57 were catalytically active. These results point to a high degree of plasticity of TS in accommodating function with structural change.
TI  - Properties of bacteriophage T4 thymidylate synthase following mutagenic changes in the active site and folate binding region.
AB  - Amino acid replacements have been introduced in specific sites of bacteriophage T4 thymidylate synthase (T4-TS) to assess the role that these changes have on enzyme activity. Each of the conserved amino acids in the active-site region of T4-TS was modified, and the effects that these changes had on the kinetic and physical properties of this enzyme were measured. The mutations introduced were Pro-155-Ala (P155A), Cys-156-Ser (C156S), and His-157-Val (H157V) with the resulting synthases possessing kcat's of 10.3, 0.008, and 2.70 s-1, respectively, relative to that of the wild-type enzyme of 11.8 s-1. Equilibrium dialysis was performed on the wild-type and mutant enzymes to determine the binding constants for 2'-deoxyuridylate and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate, and while in most cases the extent of binding of these nucleotides to the mutant proteins was reduced when compared with wild-type TS, the number of binding sites involved remained about 1 or less for the binary complex and almost 2 for the ternary complex. Heat and urea stability studies revealed that the mutant with the highest enzyme activity, P155A, was the most unstable, while spectrofluorometric analyses revealed that the structures of P155A and H157V were perturbed relative to the C156S and wild-type TSs. These studies are in agreement with others implicating the phylogenetically conserved active-site cysteine as playing an essential mechanistic role in the catalytic process promoted by TS. The proximal amino acids on either side of this cysteine, although also highly conserved, do not appear to affect the catalytic mechanism directly, but may do so indirectly through their influence on the conformation at the active site as well as other regions of the enzyme. Amino acids replacements were introduced also into the folate and deoxynucleotide 5'-phosphate binding sites of the T4-phage TS to ascertain the potential role that these amino acids play in the catalytic process. These positions were selected on the basis of previous chemical modification and X-ray crystallographic studies on Lactobacillus casei TS. Amino acid residues 48 and 49, which are in the putative folate binding site, were converted from lysines to arginines; in the former case, the mutated enzyme had less than 7% of the wild-type activity while in the latter, the mutated enzyme still retained about 60% of its activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - A IIIman protein is involved in the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by oral streptococci.
AB  - We show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called IIIman. This protein was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-TSK, hydroxyapatite, and Dyematrex Green A. The purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. However, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and Western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of S. salivarius of 2 different forms of IIIman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. The presence of the high-molecular-weight form of IIIman was observed by immunodiffusion, Western blot and phosphorylation by [32]PEP in S. salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus lactis but not in Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei. Antibodies directed against the IIIman of S. salivarius did not react with the IIIman of Escherichia coli.
TI  - The purification of dihydrofolate reductase from Drosophila melanogaster.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been purified over 30,000-fold from Drosophila adults with a yield of 35%, using a combination of low pH extraction, (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, Sephadex gel filtration, Affi-Gel blue affinity chromatography, ion exchange and gel filtration FPLC. The Drosophila enzyme is a soluble, 17-22 kDa monomeric protein displaying the two pH optima characteristic of eukaryotic DHFRs. The sequence of the first 23 amino acids from the amino-terminal end of the protein shows that Drosophila DHFR is more homologous to the mosquito and vertebrate DHFRs than to the prokaryotic enzymes. However, the percent similarity between the two insect enzymes is not as close as expected when compared to the virtually identical initial sequence conservation of mammalian DHFRs.
TI  - Role of aspartate 27 of dihydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli in interconversion of active and inactive enzyme conformers and binding of NADPH.
AB  - The apoenzyme of wild-type (WT) dihydrofolate reductase (DHRF) from Escherichia coli exists in two conformational states, Et and Ew, which differ in affinity for NADPH and in kinetic competence. Dissociation constants for the binary complex of NADPH with the two conformers differ by over 100-fold (KDt = 0.17 microM, KDw = 22 microM). Rate constants governing the interconversion of conformers are small (t1/2 for Ew----Et = 71 s), and since Ew is not catalytically competent, this conversion is accompanied by an increase in catalytic velocity. The equilibrium proportion of Et in the absence of ligands is 63%, but binding of NADPH greatly increases this proportion, and t1/2 for conversion of Ew.NADPH to Et.NADPH is 30 s. This conformational equilibrium has also been examined in mutant enzyme in which aspartate 27 is replaced by asparagine (D27N E. coli DHFR). Although ASp27 is an active site residue, it does not interact directly with bound NADPH, and in the mutant the rate constant for NADPH binding to Et is unchanged as are the dissociation constants for NADPH complexes with Et or Ew. However, for mutant apoenzyme, the proportion of Et is decreased to 18% in the absence of ligands so that the overall KD for NADPH is increased (0.15 microM for WT E. coli DHFR, 0.68 microM for D27N E. coli DHFR). The lower proportion of Et is due to a decreased rate for Ew----Et (t1/2 = 221 s) and an increased rate for Et----Ew (t1/2 = 50 s versus 120 s for WT E. coli DHFR).
TI  - Cloning and expression of the gene encoding Lactobacillus casei folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase in Escherichia coli and determination of its primary structure.
AB  - A genomic library of Lactobacillus casei DNA containing 10,000 individual clones  was constructed in the plasmid pUC13. The gene encoding the L. casei folylpolyglutamate synthetase was isolated from the library by complementation of a folC mutant of Escherichia coli. The gene was expressed in E. coli from its own promoter and produced amplified folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity with properties identical with those of the purified L. casei enzyme. The absence of dihydrofolate synthetase activity and the preferential utilization of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, rather than 10-formyltetrahydrofolate as folate substrate, distinguishes this activity from the E. coli folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase. A protein of Mr = 43,000, identical with that of purified L. casei folylpolyglutamate synthetase, was expressed in maxicells containing the complementing plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of the folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene was determined. An open reading frame of 1,284 bases was found predicting a protein product of 428 amino acids with Mr = 44,169. The predicted amino acid sequence of the gene is 33% homologous to that of the E. coli folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Primer extension studies indicate that the transcription initiation site is at -59 base pairs, relative to the initiation ATG codon of the folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene, suggesting that the gene is transcribed independently of upstream genes. A second open reading frame was found downstream of the folylpolyglutamate synthetase open reading frame, overlapping the final codon by 1 base pair. This downstream gene may be co-transcribed with the folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene.
TI  - [Bacterial penetration of bovine dentinal tubules. 1].
AB  - The penetration by bacteria through dentinal tubules was studied using a device that included portion of bovine anterior teeth. Strains of 4 genera, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, were used for the experiment, and the effects of acid etching of dentin on the penetration of bacteria through the dentin was examined. The time required for penetration through dentinal tubules of acid-etched samples was shorter than that of unetched samples. The minimum time required for half the samples to become positive for bacterial penetration through dentin MPT50 was 4 hours for all strains chosen when the acid-etched dentin was the target. In non-acid etched samples, the MPT50 varied among the genera and ranged from 20 hours to 48 hours; the speed of penetration was Sta. aureus = L. casei greater than Str. mutans greater than E. coli. Observation under the scanning electron microscope indicated that the smeared layer was completely coated on the surface of the prepared cavity, and when bacterial penetration occurred, a portion of the smear layer on the dentin disappeared. In longitudinal sections, the penetration by the bacteria into the tubules was visible. From these results, it is suggested that the smeared layer have an important effects on bacterial penetration through these tubules.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences and genomic constitution of five tryptophan genes of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Five trp genes, trpD, trpC, trpF, trpB, and trpA, of Lactobacillus casei were cloned by transformation of tryptophan auxotrophic mutants of the respective trp genes in Escherichia coli. These trp genes appear to constitute an operon and are located in the above order in a segment of DNA of 6,468 base pairs. The entire nucleotide sequence of this DNA segment was determined. Five contiguous open reading frames in this segment can encode proteins consisting of 341, 260, 199, 406, and 266 amino acids, respectively, in the same direction. The amino acid sequences of these proteins exhibit 25.5-50.2% homology with the amino acid sequences of the corresponding trp enzymes of E. coli. Two trp genes, trpC and trpF, from L. casei can complement mutant alleles of the corresponding genes of E. coli. However, neither the trpA gene nor the trpB gene of L. casei can complement mutations in the E. coli trpA gene and the trpB gene, respectively, suggesting that the protein products of the L. casei and E. coli trpA and trpB genes, respectively, cannot form heterodimers of tryptophan synthetase with activity. Other features of the coding and flanking regions of the trp genes are also described.
TI  - Chemical synthesis of the thymidylate synthase gene.
AB  - A 978-base-pair gene that encodes thymidylate synthase (TS; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) from Lactobacillus casei has been synthesized and inserted into Escherichia coli expression vectors. The DNA sequence contains 35 unique restriction sites that are located an average of 28 base pairs apart throughout the entire length of the gene. A ribosome binding site was included 9 base pairs upstream from the translation start site and codon usage was adjusted to ensure efficient translation in E. coli. The TS gene is flanked by unique EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites that render the gene portable to any of several E. coli expression vectors. Catalytically active TS encoded by the synthetic gene is expressed in large amounts (10-20% of the soluble protein) and is indistinguishable from that isolated from L. casei. The utility of the synthetic gene for mutagenesis is demonstrated by a single experiment in which His-199 was replaced with 14 different amino acids. Analysis of the mutants by genetic complementation indicates that TS can tolerate a number of amino acid substitutions at that position and shows that His-199 is not strictly required for catalytic activity.
TI  - Plastic adaptation toward mutations in proteins: structural comparison of thymidylate synthases.
AB  - The structure of thymidylate synthase (TS) from Escherichia coli was solved from  cubic crystals with a = 133 A grown under reducing conditions at pH 7.0, and refined to R = 22% at 2.1 A resolution. The structure is compared with that from Lactobacillus casei solved to R = 21% at 2.3 A resolution. The structures are compared using a difference distance matrix, which identifies a common core of residues that retains the same relationship to one another in both species. After subtraction of the effects of a 50 amino acid insert present in Lactobacillus casei, differences in position of atoms correlate with temperature factors and with distance from the nearest substituted residue. The dependence of structural difference on thermal factor is parameterized and reflects both errors in coordinates that correlate with thermal factor, and the increased width of the energy well in which atoms of high thermal factor lie. The dependence of structural difference on distance from the nearest substitution also depends on thermal factors and shows an exponential dependence with half maximal effect at 3.0 A from the substitution. This represents the plastic accommodation of the protein which is parameterized in terms of thermal B factor and distance from a mutational change.
TI  - Sequence and characteristics of the Bifidobacterium longum gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase and the primary structure of the enzyme: a new feature of the allosteric site.
AB  - The gene ldh, encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; EC 1.1.1.27) of Bifidobacterium longum aM101-2, was cloned in Escherichia coli using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide hybridization probe. The amino acid (aa) sequence, deduced from the sequence of the cloned DNA, was consistent with the results of protein chemical analysis of B. longum LDH. The transcription start points (tsp) in B. longum were identified by S1 nuclease mapping. A sequence, GTAGCAA-(14 bp)-TTATAGA, which is located a few bp upstream from the tsp, was assigned as the promoter of this ldh gene. In the 3'-noncoding region, there were two structures that strongly resembled the Rho-independent transcriptional termination signal of E. coli. Therefore, the B. longum ldh gene might form a monocistronic unit. The deduced primary structure of B. longum LDH had 40% identity with LDHs from Thermus caldophilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and dogfish muscle. Most bacterial LDHs are allosterically regulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), while the vertebrate LDHs are not. The anion-binding site of vertebrate LDHs has been thought to correspond to the FBP-binding site of bacterial LDHs. Although the B. longum LDH was regulated by FBP, the charge properties of aa residues in the putative FBP-binding site of the LDH were closer to those of the vertebrate LDHs than to those of bacterial LDHs.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase-encoding gene of Lactobacillus confusus in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene (L-HicDH) encoding L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (L-HicDH) from Lactobacillus confusus was cloned in Escherichia coli. A 69-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe, derived to be complementary to the N-terminal amino acid (aa) coding sequence, was used for screening. The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of the L-HicDH gene was determined. The 5'-end of the mRNA was mapped by primer extension and the promoter identified. Downstream from the L-HicDH gene is a typical Rho-independent terminator. The aa sequence of L-HicDH, deduced from the nt sequence, has an overall similarity of 30% to the aa sequence of L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH) from Lactobacillus casei. The aa residues involved in binding of coenzyme and substrate are highly conserved in L-HicDH with respect to prokaryotic and eukaryotic L-LDHs. The L-HicDH gene could be expressed under control of phage lambda 'Leftward' and 'rightward' promoters in E. coli up to 35% of total cell protein. The enzyme produced under these conditions exhibits full specific activity and is found exclusively in soluble form.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductase of the extremely halophilic archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii. The enzyme and its coding gene.
AB  - Halobacterium volcanii mutants that are resistant to the dihydrofolate reductase  inhibitor trimethoprim contain DNA sequence amplifications. This paper describes the cloning and nucleic acid sequencing of the amplified DNA sequence of the H. volcanii mutant WR215. This sequence contains an open reading frame that codes for an amino acid sequence that is homologous to the amino acid sequences of dihydrofolate reductases from different sources. As a result of the gene amplification, the trimethoprim-resistant mutant overproduces dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate-mediated chromatographies. It is shown that the enzyme comprises 5% of the cell protein. The amino acid sequence of the first 15 amino acids of the enzyme fits the coding sequence of the gene. Preliminary biochemical characterization shows that the enzyme is unstable at salt concentrations lower than 2 M and that its activity increases with increase in the KCl or NaCl concentrations.
TI  - A kinetic study of wild-type and mutant dihydrofolate reductases from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - A kinetic scheme is presented for Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase that predicts steady-state kinetic parameters. This scheme was derived from measuring association and dissociation rate constants and pre-steady-state transients by using stopped-flow fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. Two major features of this kinetic scheme are the following: (i) product dissociation is the rate-limiting step for steady-state turnover at low pH and follows a specific, preferred pathway in which tetrahydrofolate (H4F) dissociation occurs after NADPH replaces NADP+ in the ternary complex; (ii) the rate constant for hydride transfer from NADPH to dihydrofolate (H2F) is rapid (khyd = 430 s-1), favorable (Keq = 290), and pH dependent (pKa = 6.0), reflecting ionization of a single group. Not only is this scheme identical in form with the Escherichia coli kinetic scheme [Fierke et al. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4085] but moreover none of the rate constants vary by more than 40-fold despite there being less than 30% amino acid homology between the two enzymes. This similarity is consistent with their overall structural congruence. The role of Trp-21 of L. casei dihydrofolate reductase in binding and catalysis was probed by amino acid substitution. Trp-21, a strictly conserved residue near both the folate and coenzyme binding sites, was replaced by leucine. Two major effects of this substitution are on (i) the rate constant for hydride transfer which decreases 100-fold, becoming the rate-limiting step in steady-state turnover, and (ii) the affinities for NADPH and NADP+ which decrease by approximately 3.5 and approximately 0.5 kcal mol-1, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Expression of human thymidylate synthase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A cDNA clone encoding thymidylate synthase (TS) has been isolated from a human T-cell library and modified in the 5'-untranslated region to incorporate several unique cloning sites. The gene has been cloned as a cassette into several Escherichia coli expression vectors which did not provide detectable amounts of the enzyme. A successful approach used a constitutive E. coli expression vector developed for the enzyme from Lactobacillus casei. A 115-base pair 5'-untranslated region from the L. casei TS which contains a ribosomal binding site and other regulatory sequences has been fused to the coding region of the human TS gene to provide a construct that is expressed in E. coli. The level of expression was further enhanced by altering the nucleotide sequence of the first 90 base pairs to accommodate common codon use in E. coli. In our best expression system, catalytically active human TS is expressed to a level that represents about 1.6% of the total soluble protein. The recombinant human TS has been purified and characterized; except for the presence of an amino-terminal blocking group, the enzyme has physical and kinetic properties similar to the enzyme isolated from human cells.
TI  - Hydride transfer by dihydrofolate reductase. Causes and consequences of the wide  range of rates exhibited by bacterial and vertebrate enzymes.
AB  - Transient and steady-state kinetics have been examined for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from a number of sources. Rates of hydride transfer at pH 7.65 cover a wide range, from 7 s-1 for DHFR from a strain of Lactobacillus casei (LCDHFR1) to 3000 s-1 for recombinant human DHFR (rHDHFR). In all cases as the pH is increased from 7 to 10, Vmax for the steady-state reaction decreases, and DVmax, the primary isotope effect, increases. This indicates a decrease in the rate of hydride transfer with increasing pH. The cross-over points, at which rates of product release and hydride transfer become equal, were calculated to occur at DVmax = 2.34. The higher the rate of hydride transfer at pH 7.65, the higher the pH of the cross-over point. For LCDHFR1 the low rate of hydride transfer results in this process being partially rate-limiting for the steady-state reaction even at pH 5, with a cross-over point at about pH 7. At pH 7.65 the burst phase associated with the initial conversion of enzyme-bound substrates to enzyme-bound products has an isotope effect of 3 or higher for LCDHFR and for DHFR from Escherichia coli (ECDHFR). In contrast, the vertebrate DHFRs (bovine, BDHFR; chicken, CDHFR; and rHDHFR) exhibit a burst of product formation which is only partially limited by hydride transfer at this pH (Dkb: 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1, respectively). An obligatory isomerization of the ternary substrate complex or of the ternary product complex is postulated to be partially rate-limiting for the vertebrate enzymes. At pH 5 LCDHFR1 and ECDHFR also exhibit evidence of such a rate-limiting obligatory conformational transition of the substrate or product ternary complex.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression in Escherichia coli of the D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase gene of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - D-2-Hydroxyisocaproic acid dehydrogenase (D-HicDH) from Lactobacillus casei was purified and partially sequenced. A 65-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe corresponding to the N-terminal 23 amino acids was synthesized and a physical map was made of the genomic region which hybridized most strongly. A strongly hybridising restriction fragment was highly purified and eventually cloned at low frequency in pBR322. The original clones spontaneously produced D-HicDH at about 0.05% of total protein and showed viability problems in that 10- to 12-h growth-lag periods occurred after diluting stationary cultures into fresh medium. Subcloning into pGEM3 plasmids for sequencing with concomitant ExoIII deletion led to clones which no longer exhibited the growth inhibition characteristics but now made D-HicDH as 3 to 5% of total protein. Subcloning downstream from a double PL PR promoter in plasmid pJLA601 gave a highly inducible clone that builds large inclusion bodies of largely denatured D-HicDH. The gene transcript was mapped for L. casei and Escherichia coli hosts. The promoter, terminator and Shine-Dalgarno sequence are functional in both organisms. The gene encodes a protein subunit of 38 kDa, whereby 67% of the sequence could be checked by correlation with partial peptide sequences from the original enzyme. So far no Lactobacillus gene has been found to utilize the Arg codons AGG and AGA.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductase: multiple conformations and alternative modes of substrate binding.
AB  - The complex of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase with the substrate folate and the coenzyme NADP+ has been shown to exist in solution as a mixture of three slowly interconverting conformations whose proportions are pH-dependent [Birdsall, B., Gronenborn, A. M., Hyde, E. I., Clore, G. M., Roberts, G. C. K., Feeney, J., & Burgen, A. S. V. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 5831]. The assignment of the resonances of all the aromatic protons of the ligand molecules in all three conformational states of the complex has now been completed by using a variety of NMR methods, particularly two-dimensional exchange experiments. The resonances of the nicotinamide protons of the coenzyme and the pteridine 7-proton of the folate have different chemical shifts in the three conformations, in some cases differing by more than 1 ppm. Comparison of the COSY spectra of the complex at low pH (conformation I) and high pH (conformations IIa and IIb) with that of the enzyme-methotrexate-NADP+ complex shows only slight differences in the conformation of the protein. The pattern of chemical shift changes in the ligand and the protein indicates that the structural differences are localized within the active site of the enzyme. Nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) are observed between the nicotinamide 5- and 6-protons and the methyl resonance of Thr 45 at both low and high pH, indicating that there is no major movement of the nicotinamide ring. By contrast, NOEs are observed between the pteridine 7-proton and the methyl protons of Leu 19 and Leu 27 in conformations I and IIa but not in conformation IIb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Interactions between inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The binding of substrates and inhibitors to dihydrofolate reductase was studied by steady-state kinetics and high-field 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. A series of 5-substituted 2,4-diaminopyrimidines were examined and were found to be 'tightly binding' inhibitors of the enzyme (Ki less than 10(-9) M). Studies on the binding of 4-substituted benzenesulphonamides and benzenesulphonic acids also established the existence of a 'sulphonamide-binding site' on the enzyme. Subsequent n.m.r. experiments showed that there are two binding sites for the sulphonamides on the enzyme, one of which overlaps the coenzyme (NADPH) adenine-ring-binding site. An examination of the pH-dependence of the binding of sulphonamides to the enzyme indicated the influence of an ionizable group on the enzyme that was not directly involved in the sulphonamide binding. The change in pKa value from 6.7 to 7.2 observed on sulphonamide binding suggests the involvement of a histidine residue, which could be histidine-28.
TI  - Atypical transient state kinetics of recombinant human dihydrofolate reductase produced by hysteretic behavior. Comparison with dihydrofolate reductases from other sources.
AB  - The transient state kinetics of catalysis for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from several enzyme sources including highly purified recombinant human enzyme (rHDHFR) have been examined. Like DHFR from Escherichia coli, the enzyme from Lactobacillus casei, and isoenzyme 2 from Streptococcus faecium exhibit a slow increase in activity upon addition of substrates to enzyme. No slow hysteresis of this type was detected with recombinant human DHFR (rHDHFR) or DHFR from chicken or bovine liver or L1210 mouse leukemia cells (MDHFR). In contrast, both rHDHFR and MDHFR exhibited a very rapid decrease in activity (t1/2 = 30 and 20 ms, respectively) during a phase that occurred after the first turnover of the enzyme but before establishment of the steady state. This intermediate phase was not observed for the bacterial enzymes or the avian enzyme, nor was it observed with a mutant of rHDHFR in which Phe-31 has been replaced by leucine. For rHDHFR the intermediate phase is not a consequence of product inhibition, substrate depletion, or enzyme instability. It may therefore be concluded that this unusual transient state kinetic behavior results from the existence of two conformers of the enzyme, one of which has a higher turnover number than the other with the equilibrium shifting in favor of the less active conformer during the course of catalysis. The equilibrium is particularly favorable for the less active conformer when NADP is present in the active site of rHDHFR, whereas bound tetrahydrofolate favors the more active conformer. The more active conformer has a 6-fold higher Km for dihydrofolate than does the less active conformer. The existence of these conformers is likely to produce cooperative behavior by rHDHFR in vivo.
TI  - NMR studies of differences in the conformations and dynamics of ligand complexes  formed with mutant dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  - Two mutants of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase, Trp 21----Leu and Asp 26----Glu, have been prepared by using site-directed mutagenesis methods, and their ligand binding and structural properties have been compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR studies have been carried out to characterize the structural changes in the complexes of the mutant and wild-type enzymes. Replacement of the conserved Trp 21 by a Leu residue causes a decrease in activity of the enzyme and reduces the NADPH binding constant by a factor of 400. The binding of substrates and substrate analogues is only slightly affected. 1H NMR studies of the Trp 21----Leu enzyme complexes have confirmed the original resonance assignments for Trp 21. In complexes formed with methotrexate and the mutant enzyme, the results indicate some small changes in conformation occurring as much as 14 A away from the site of substitution. For the enzyme-NADPH complexes, the chemical shifts of nuclei in the bound coenzyme indicate that the nicotinamide ring binds differently in complexes with the mutant and the wild-type enzyme. There are complexes where the wild-type enzyme has been shown to exist in solution as a mixture of conformations, and studies on the corresponding complexes with the Trp 21----Leu mutant indicate that the delicately poised equilibria can be perturbed. For example, in the case of the ternary complex formed between enzyme, trimethoprim, and NADP+, two almost equally populated conformations (forms I and II) are seen with the wild-type enzyme but only form II (the one in which the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is extended away from the enzyme structure and into the solvent) is observed for the mutant enzyme complex. It appears that the Trp 21----Leu substitution has a major effect on the binding of the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme. For the Asp 26----Glu enzyme there is a change in the bound conformation of the substrate folate. Further indications that some conformational adjustments are required to allow the carboxylate of Glu 26 to bind effectively to the N1 proton of inhibitors such as methotrexate and trimethoprim come from the observation of a change in the dynamics of the bound trimethoprim molecule as seen from the increased rate of the flipping of the 13C-labeled benzyl ring and the increased rate of the N1-H bond breaking.
TI  - Augmentation of resistance of mice to bacterial infection by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) extracted from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - A water-soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (PSPG) was prepared from heat-killed Lactobacillus casei by digesting the bacteria with N-acetylmuramidase. The molecular weight of PSPG was over 30,000, and the polysaccharide portion of PSPG, its main component was composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, glucosamine and galactosamine. Mice pretreated intraperitoneally with PSPG survived after a lethal infection with Listeria monocytogenes or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of infecting bacteria (L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli) in both the peritoneal cavity and the liver was inhibited markedly in the mice that had been treated with PSPG. It was suggested that macrophages may be the main effector for the anti-infectious effect of PSPG since treatment of mice with carrageenan, a selective macrophage blocker, markedly reduced the anti-infectious effect of PSPG.
TI  - Vitamin contents of archaebacteria.
AB  - The levels of six water-soluble vitamins of seven archaebacterial species were determined and compared with the levels found in a eubacterium, Escherichia coli. Biotin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, and lipoic acid contents of Halobacterium volcanii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H, "Archaeoglobus fulgidus" VC-16, Thermococcus celer, Pyrodictium occultum, Thermoproteus tenax, and Sulfolobus solfataricus were measured by using bioassays. The archaebacteria examined were found to contain these vitamins at levels similar to or significantly below the levels found in in E. coli. Riboflavin was found at levels comparable to those in E. coli. Pyridoxine was as abundant among the archaebacteria of the methanogenhalophile branch as in E. coli. It was only one-half as abundant in the sulfur-metabolizing branch. "A. fulgidus," however, contained only 4% as much pyridoxine as E. coli. Nicotinic and pantothenic acids were approximately 10-fold less abundant (except for a 200-fold-lower nicotinic acid level in "A. fulgidus"). Nicotinic acid may be replaced by an 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin coenzyme (factor F420) in some archaebacteria (such as "A. fulgidus"). Compared with the level in E. coli, biotin was equally as abundant in Thermococcus celer and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, about one-fourth less abundant in P. occultum and "A. fulgidus," and 25 to over 100 times less abundant in the others. The level of lipoic acid was up to 20 times lower in H. volcanii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Thermococcus celer. It was over two orders of magnitude lower among the remaining organisms. With the exception of "A. fulgidus," lipoic acid, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine were more abundant in the members of the methanogen-halophile branch of the archaebacteria than in the sulfur-metabolizing branch.
TI  - Detection of a Lactobacillus substance that inhibits Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. This interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. In the present study, Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant Escherichia coli Hu 734 and E. coli ATCC 25922. The bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain GR-1 was retained under pH buffered conditions and was bactericidal. The bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. The data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. Human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the E. coli. The ability of L. casei GR-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase gene.
AB  - The thymidylate synthase (TS) gene from Lactobacillus casei has been isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The coding sequence is 948 bp and predicts a primary structure, identical to that reported by protein sequencing methods (Maley et al., 1979b). The gene has been placed in several expression systems which complement TS-deficient Escherichia coli, and express the catalytically active enzyme at levels of 10-20% of the soluble protein of E. coli. The expressed TS has kinetic and structural properties consistent with its being identical to the authentic enzyme from L. casei.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the phospho-beta-galactosidase genes on the lactose plasmid and the chromosome of Lactobacillus casei C257 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A 4.7 kb BglII fragment of lactose plasmid pLY101 of Lactobacillus casei C257, which hybridized weakly to a fragment including a streptococcal phospho-beta-galactosidase (P-beta-gal) gene, was cloned into plasmid vectors of Escherichia coli. Transformant cells expressed P-beta-gal activity, confirming the presence of a P-beta-gal gene on pLY101. Deletion mapping showed that the structural gene of P-beta-gal was located on the 2.4 kb PvuI-EcoRV fragment. The direction of transcription was determined using an expression vector. L. casei MSK248 is a non-lactose-utilizing, pLY101-cured derivative of C257 and no P-beta-gal activity was detected. From MSK248, spontaneous lactose-utilizing revertants having P-beta-gal activity were isolated. Using the pLY101-derived P-beta-gal gene as a probe, a homologous sequence was detected in the chromosomal DNAs of MSK248 and MSK256, and cloned into plasmid vectors of E. coli. Both transformants carrying the homologous sequence from MSK248 and MSK256 expressed P-beta-gal activity. Restriction maps of the chromosomal P-beta-gal genes from MSK248 and MSK256 were identical with that derived from pLY101.
TI  - A flexible multiple sequence alignment program.
AB  - The 'regions' method for multisequence alignment used in the previously reported  program MALIGN has been generalized to include recursive refinement so that unaligned portions between two regions at the current level of resolution can be handled with increased resolution. Additionally, there is incorporated a limiting of the number of regions to be used at any level of resolution from which to abstract an alignment. This provides a significant increase in speed over the unlimited version. The program GENALIGN uses this improved regions method to execute fast pairwise alignments in the framework of Taylor's multisequence alignment procedure using clustered pairwise alignments. Pairwise alignments by dynamic programming are also provided in the program.
TI  - Insights into enzyme function from studies on mutants of dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - Kinetic analysis and protein mutagenesis allow the importance of individual amino acids in ligand binding and catalysis to be assessed. A kinetic analysis has shown that the reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase is optimized with respect to product flux, which in turn is predetermined by the active-site hydrophobic surface. Protein mutagenesis has revealed that specific hydrophobic residues contribute 2 to 5 kilocalories per mole to ligand binding and catalysis. The extent to which perturbations within this active-site ensemble may affect catalysis is discussed in terms of the constraints imposed by the energy surface for the reaction.
TI  - Lactobacillus inhibitor production against Escherichia coli and coaggregation ability with uropathogens.
AB  - Previous investigations have shown that certain strains of lactobacilli can competitively exclude uropathogens from attaching to uroepithelial cells and from causing urinary tract infection in animals. The finding of an inhibitory effect produced by Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus GR-1 against the growth of uropathogens was investigated further using two Escherichia coli indicator strains Hu 734 and ATCC 25922. There were two phases to the inhibitor studies. The first one using an agar sandwich technique showed that the inhibitor activity was heat stable and inhibitory to the E. coli. The second phase showed that MRS broth provided optimum lactobacilli growth and inhibitor production. In addition, the inhibition was present under conditions buffering for acid and pH. The data indicated that the inhibitory effect was not due to bacteriophages or hydrogen peroxide. Strain GR-1 was found to coaggregate with E. coli ATCC 25922 in urine, a phenomenon that has not previously been reported for urogenital bacteria. An in vitro assay system was developed to study the coaggregation of various lactobacilli and uropathogens. The results demonstrated that highest coaggregation scores occurred after 4 h incubation at 37 degrees C with lactobacilli and two type-1 fimbriated E. coli strains. Of the nine lactobacilli strains tested, each was found to coaggregate with 2 or more of the 13 uropathogens. The dominance of inhibitor-producing lactobacilli on the urogenital epithelium and the ability of these organisms to interact closely with uropathogens would constitute an important host defense mechanism against infection.
TI  - Intravaginal instillation of lactobacilli for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections remain a common problem, particularly in the female population. New methods are required to manage recurrent cystitis, and extensive research to date has suggested that restoration of the lactobacilli flora of the urogenital tract may prevent these infections. In this study, five females suffering from recurrent urinary tract infections were treated twice weekly with intravaginal and perineal implantation of Lactobacillus casei GR-1. These organisms colonized the epithelium and prevented the emergence of coliform bacteria in most instances, but did not appear to affect enterococcal colonization. In vitro studies showed that L. casei GR-1 inhibited the growth of the coliforms but did not inhibit enterococci. Each of the five patients had infection-free periods ranging from 4 weeks to 6 months. The treatment was well tolerated, had no side effects, led to an improved well-being, and was preferred to antibiotic treatment by all of the patients. These human studies, albeit of a limited nature, are the first to examine the potential for lactobacillus therapy in the prevention of urinary tract infections. The results show that lactobacilli therapy, using carefully selected organisms to treat patients who are closely followed, may be effective in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the factor IIIlac gene of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The lactose-specific factor III (FIIIlac of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) was isolated from Lactobacillus casei and purified to homogeneity by conventional protein purification methods. Its apparent native Mr, estimated from steric exclusion chromatography (approx. 39 kDa), and subunit Mr, estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, indicated that it exists as a trimer of identical subunits of 13 kDa. The gene for FIII L. casei lac was cloned into Escherichia coli using the vector pUC18. The coding sequences were contained on an 860-bp BglII-HindIII DNA fragment of the L. casei lactose plasmid, pLZ64. A protein identical in properties to FIII L. casei lac was isolated from clones of E. coli carrying this DNA insert. The nucleotide sequence of the FIII L. casei lac gene was determined by the dideoxy chain-termination technique. The 336-bp open reading frame for FIII L. casei lac was followed by a stem-loop structure, analogous to a Rho-independent terminator. We concluded that the FIII L. casei lac was the terminal gene in what appears to be an operon comprised of the lactose-PTS-P-beta Gal-coding genes. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of FIII L. caseilac with the amino acid sequence of FIII S. aureus lac (derived from peptide sequencing) demonstrated a high degree of homology (49 identical residues and 21 conservative exchanges out of 103 total aa residues). The FIII L. casei lac lacked his82, previously identified as the phosphorylation site of FIII S. aureus. lac His80 was proposed to be the site of histidyl phosphorylation of FIII L. casei lac.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the cell cycle-regulated thymidylate synthase gene  of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of a 1.8-kilobase DNA fragment containing the cell cycle-regulated thymidylate synthase gene (TMP 1) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. This analysis has revealed a 912-base pair open reading frame which encodes a 304-amino acid residue protein with a calculated Mr of 35,007. The tmp1-6 and cdc21-1 mutant alleles of this gene also have been sequenced, and both show single base pair changes which would result in different amino acid substitutions. The amino acid sequence of the yeast thymidylate synthase gene derived from the DNA sequence shows considerable homology when compared with the human, mouse, Herpesvirus saimiri, Leishmania major, Leishmania tropica, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, bacteriophage T4, and Bacillus subtilis phage phi 3T enzymes. Northern blot hybridization reveals that the TMP 1 mRNA is a 1.15-kilobase polyadenylated transcript. A set of consensus yeast mRNA splice sequences appears within the open reading frame of TMP 1, but S1 nuclease protection experiments reveal that splicing of the mRNA does not occur. Disruption of the gene by the introduction of a large insertion did not produce any defect besides the expected dependence on dTMP for growth. Specifically, the viability of the mutants in the presence of dTMP indicates that the protein does not play a significant structural role in a complex of replication enzymes.
TI  - Design of dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors from X-ray crystal structures.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an important therapeutic target for treatment of cancer and microbial disease. Its species specificity has resulted in the sequencing of a number of vertebrate and bacterial DHFRs, and the three-dimensional structure of isozymes from Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, and chicken liver has been elucidated, in the presence of the coenzyme NADPH and of a number of inhibitors. This information has enabled scientists to try to design improved and more selective inhibitors, based on the known coordinates of the enzyme features. Simple use of computer graphics or wire models has resulted in the design of inhibitors with 50 times the activity of trimethoprim, an antibacterial DHFR inhibitor, by making use of an unused ionic binding site. However, in a number of instances this approach was completely unsuccessful because hydrophobic sites of interaction were preferred. More sophisticated techniques involve energy minimization of the small molecule-macromolecule interactions to optimize the geometry. In this paper I describe the use of a molecular mechanics program, AMBER, for predicting the geometry and relative energetics of binding. Very encouraging results have been obtained for a closely related series of compounds. Where differing entropic and solvent effects are involved, predictions may be poor. The use of super computers and molecular dynamics methods should increase this capability in the near future.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and characteristics of the gene for L-lactate dehydrogenase of Thermus caldophilus GK24 and the deduced amino-acid sequence of the enzyme.
AB  - The gene for L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (EC 1.1.1.27) of Thermus caldophilus GK24 was cloned in Escherichia coli using synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was determined. The primary structure of the LDH was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence agreed with the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal sequences previously reported and the determined amino acid sequences of the peptides obtained from trypsin-digested T. caldophilus LDH. The LDH comprised 310 amino acid residues and its molecular mass was determined to be 32,808. On alignment of the whole amino acid sequences, the T. caldophilus LDH showed about 40% identity with the Bacillus stearothermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and dogfish muscle LDHs. The T. caldophilus LDH gene was expressed with the E. coli lac promoter in E. coli, which resulted in the production of the thermophilic LDH. The gene for the T. caldophilus LDH showed more than 40% identity with those for the human and mouse muscle LDHs on alignment of the whole nucleotide sequences. The G + C content of the coding region for the T. caldophilus LDH was 74.1%, which was higher than that of the chromosomal DNA (67.2%). The G + C contents in the first, second and third positions of the codons used were 77.7%, 48.1% and 95.5% respectively. The high G + C content in the third base caused extremely non-random codon usage in the LDH gene. About half (48.7%) the codons in the LDH gene started with G, and hence there were relatively high contents of Val, Ala, Glu and Gly in the LDH. The contents of Pro, Arg, Ala and Gly, which have high G + C contents in their codons, were also high. Rare codons with U or A as the third base were sometimes used to avoid the TCGA sequence, the recognition site for the restriction endonuclease, TaqI. Two TCGA sequences were found only in the sequence of CTCGAG (XhoI site) in the sequenced region of the T. caldophilus DNA. There were three segments with similar sequences in the two 5' non-coding regions, probably the promoter and ribosome-binding regions, of the genes for the T. caldophilus LDH and the Thermus thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase.
TI  - Comparison of solution structures of dihydrofolate reductases and enzyme-ligand complexes using cross-reacting antibodies.
AB  - Polyclonal antibodies against dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from the human lymphoblastoid cell line WIL-2/M4 were used as probes to compare the antigenic structures in solution of native DHFRs obtained from a broad range of species and their complexes with substrate, cofactor, and folate antagonist inhibitors. All these antibodies could bind to the denatured human DHFR, indicating that they were specific for the primary structure of this enzyme. Denatured chicken liver and L1210 murine leukemic DHFRs competed for all of the antibodies that bound to the human enzyme, although less effectively than the denatured human enzyme, showing the presence of similar epitopes among the vertebrate enzymes. However, both direct binding and competition experiments showed low antibody cross-reactivities with native chicken liver (8%) and murine (10%) DHFRs, suggesting differences in the disposition of similar epitopes in these enzymes. The lactobacillus casei DHFR showed a low amount (less than 2%) of cross-reactivity with the antibodies while the same antibodies did not cross-react with the Escherichia coli enzyme. DHFR from soybean seedlings competed for a large proportion (70%) of the anti-human DHFR antibodies, indicating a close similarity in the antigenic structures of plant and animal DHFRs. Binary complexes of the L. casei, avian, murine, and human DHFRs with dihydrofolate, methotrexate (MTX), trimethoprim (TMP), NADPH, and NADP+ all showed significantly lower antibody binding capacity as compared with the corresponding free enzymes. Further, these ligands inhibited antibody binding to the enzyme to varying degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro binding of potent mutagenic pyrolysates to intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The ability of 22 strains of intestinal bacteria to bind the mutagenic pyrolyzates--3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido-[4,3-b]indole [(Trp-P-1) CAS: 62450-06-0], 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido [4,3-b]indole [(Trp-P-2) CAS: 62450-07-1], 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(Glu-P-1) CAS: 67730-11-4], 2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole [(Glu-P-2) CAS: 67730-10-3], 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(IQ) CAS: 76180-96-6], 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline [(MeIQ) CAS: 77094-11-2], and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [(MeIQx) CAS: 77500-04-0]--was investigated and compared to their ability to bind to some dietary fibers (corn bran, apple pulp, soy bean fiber, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan). The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts. These results indicate that the binding was mostly due to a cation-exchange mechanism, but some irreversible binding of Trp-P-2 was observed, most notably to freeze-dried feces. The mutagenicity of Trp-P-2 for Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the presence of S9 mix was inhibited by the addition of LC9018 or corn bran to the reaction mixture. The results indicate that bound Trp-P-2 did not cause mutation under the assay conditions.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotics on the adhesive properties of microorganisms and an available model for its study].
AB  - The effect of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, bicillin-3, carbenicillin, levomycetin, erythromycin, streptomycin and kanamycin on the adhesive properties of 9 test microbes including 5 strains of Lactobacillus from human microflora, 3 uropathornic strains of E. coli and 1 strain of S. aureus was studied with the method developed by the authors. The method is based on the use of formalinized human erythrocytes as macroorganism cells. It was shown that the antibiotic inhibitory effect on adhesion depended on mechanism of action of the antibiotics and their concentration, was associated with the level of the microbial adhesion and did not depend on the microbial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - Crystallographic investigation of the cooperative interaction between trimethoprim, reduced cofactor and dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The structure of the complex between E. coli (RT500) form I dihydrofolate reductase, the antibacterial trimethoprim and NADPH has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The inhibitor and cofactor are in mutual contact. A flexible chain segment which includes Met 20 is in contact with the inhibitor in the presence of NADPH, but more distant in its absence. By contrast, the inhibitor conformation is little changed with NADPH present. We discuss these observations with regard to the mutually cooperative binding of these ligands to the protein, and to the associated enhancement of inhibitory selectivity shown by trimethoprim for bacterial as opposed to vertebrate enzyme.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of Streptococcus mutans: purification of HPr and enzyme I and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Enzyme I and HPr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in Streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme I and HPr from S. mutans ATCC 27352. Using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme I and HPr in cells of S. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of S. mutans. HPr was purified by the procedure reported by Gauthier et al. (L. Gauthier, D. Mayrand, and C. Vadeboncoeur, J. Bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. Enzyme I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-Streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. The subunit molecular weight of enzyme I determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. In gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees C, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme I is a dimer. In double immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against HPr reacted with several oral streptococci, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus casei, but not with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antibodies against enzyme I of S. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme I from all the other oral streptococci tested. No cross-reaction was observed with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The levels of enzyme I and HPr determined by rocket electrophoresis in S. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. Glucose-grown cells of other S. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme I and HPr which were similar to those found in S. mutans 27352.
TI  - Quantitative structure-activity relationship of antifolate inhibition of bacteria cell cultures resistant and sensitive to methotrexate.
AB  - Sets of 5-(substituted benzyl)-2,4-diaminopyrimidines and 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-1-(3-substituted phenyl)-s-triazines as well as several other antifolates were tested as inhibitors of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase and E. coli cell cultures both sensitive and resistant to methotrexate. From the results quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) were formulated. The triazines were found to inhibit sensitive and resistant cell cultures to the same degree, but the benzylpyrimidines showed marked differences against the two types of cells. Increased hydrophobicity produced benzylpyrimidines more active against the resistant E. coli cell. Metroprine did not discriminate between the two types of cells cultures, but pyrimethamine and 2,4-diamino-6-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin e (BW 301U) did. The results are compared with triazines and benzylpyrimidines acting on Lactobacillus casei and murine tumor cells sensitive and resistant to methotrexate. QSAR is shown to be an effective means for detecting receptor differences.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Limited proteolysis of the bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase from Leishmania tropica.
AB  - The structure and activity of the bifunctional thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) from the protozoan parasite Leishmania tropica were examined by limited proteolysis with five different endopeptidases. Each reaction resulted in a rapid, time-dependent loss of TS activity and no effect on DHFR activity. The proteolytic products were examined by NaDodSO4/PAGE; each digestion produced a fragment of apparent Mr approximately 35,000, and three of the five digestions generated a fragment of Mr approximately 20,000. Attempts to separate the fragments under nondenaturing conditions failed, suggesting that the proteolyzed protein remains a dimer with the gross structure of the subunits more or less undisturbed. In contrast, kinetic data indicate that some aspects of higher-order structure in the native protein are affected by proteolysis. The fragments (Mr 36,600 and 20,000) generated by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease were subjected to sequence analysis. Whereas neither the native protein nor the Mr 36,600 fragment yielded an NH2-terminal amino acid, we obtained the sequence of the first 28 amino acids of the Mr 20,000 fragment. This sequence bore strong homology with sequences situated within TS of human, Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, and bacteriophage T4. These and other data indicate that the TS-DHFR polypeptide consists of a DHFR sequence at the blocked NH2-terminal and a TS sequence at the COOH-terminal end of the protein. The region that is the target of the five proteases corresponds to a highly variable region within the sequences of the other four TSs. We suggest that an insertion occurs within the TS-DHFR sequence, positioned on the surface of the protein and quite vulnerable to the action of endopeptidases.
TI  - Prevention of urinary tract infection in rats with an indigenous Lactobacillus casei strain.
AB  - Our previous studies have shown that indigenous bacteria are able to block the in vitro attachment of uropathogenic bacteria to human uroepithelial cells. In the present study, we applied the concept of competitive exclusion to an animal model. A chronic urinary tract infection was established in female rats with bacteria incorporated into agar beads injected periurethrally into the urinary bladder via a no. 3 French ureteral catheter. Five strains of uropathogenic organisms were used in the first set of experiments, and their colonization of the bladder and kidneys of the animals was confirmed up to 2 months after injection. The uropathogens stimulated an immune response, detected by serum antibodies against the uropathogens, and an inflammatory response noted in sections of the kidneys stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Using this animal model, we established the persistent adherence of bacteria in the urinary tract without the need for creation of obstruction or implantation of a foreign body. In a second set of experiments, an isolate of Lactobacillus casei GR1 taken from the urethra of a healthy woman was incorporated into agar beads, instilled within the rat bladders on day 1, and then swabbed twice weekly for 21 days onto the introitus before challenge with uropathogens instilled into the urinary bladder. In 21 of 25 animals, no uropathogenic bacteria were recovered from the bladder and kidney tissues up to 60 days after challenge, and no immune response was detected. Our results show that L. casei prevented onset of urinary tract infection in 84% of the animals tested. The lactobacilli appeared to exclude the uropathogens from colonizing the urinary tract, within the first 48 hours after challenge, and the net effect was a complete eradication of bacteria from the uroepithelium. It is hoped that the demonstration of a protective role for indigenous bacteria in preventing urinary tract infection in an animal model will lead to the application of this technology to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in female patients.
TI  - Multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - Bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 S ribosomal RNA confers resistance to M, L, and S B-type (MLSB) antibiotics. Investigation, by DNA annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from Streptococcus (groups A,B,D, and H, and pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the MLSB resistance (R) determinants. A minimum of four distinct classes of MLSB R determinants could be defined: classes A and B for the Gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class C for B. licheniformis, and class D for Bact. fragilis. These data do not support the hypothesis that the R determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the Gram-positive cocci. The genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards MLSB antibiotics. Inactivation of the drug confers resistance to M and/or L and/or S or SA or SB antibiotics and has been detected in strains of Streptococcus, Staph. aureus, Lactobacillus, C. perfringens, Streptomyces, and recently in the Gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. We have cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment conferring high level resistance (MIC greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. The distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. The gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of E. coli belonging to various biotypes, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. Moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic in enterobacteria.
TI  - Characterization and molecular cloning of cryptic plasmids isolated from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Four small cryptic plasmids were isolated from Lactobacillus casei strains, and restriction endonuclease maps of these plasmids were constructed. Three of the small plasmids (pLZ18C, pLZ19E, and pLZ19F1; 6.4, 4.9, and 4.8 kilobase pairs, respectively) were cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 by using pBR322, pACYC184, and pUC8 as vectors. Two of the plasmids, pLZ18C and pLZ19E, were also cloned into Streptococcus sanguis by using pVA1 as the vector. Hybridization by using nick-translated cloned 32P-labeled L. casei plasmid DNA as the probe revealed that none of the cryptic plasmids had appreciable DNA-DNA homology with the large lactose plasmids found in the L. casei strains, with chromosomal DNAs isolated from these strains. Partial homology was detected among several plasmids isolated from different strains, but not among cryptic plasmids isolated from the same strain.
TI  - Maximum likelihood estimation of subsequence conservation.
AB  - A statistical method is presented for comparing protein sequences by partitioning the polymers and estimating each subsegment's degree of conservation. Conservation is measured as a function of the number of transitions occurring in the underlying time homogeneous Markov process assumed to govern amino acid mutations. The Markovian assumption also permits estimation of the ancestral sequence. Partitioning and estimation are carried out via maximum likelihood. The method is contrasted with the commonly utilized percent homology measure. A moving likelihood ratio plot to aid in identifying regions of high conservation is suggested as an analogue to moving hydrophobicity plots. An application is presented which identifies highly conserved regions in thymidylate synthase from L. casei and E. coli.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a functional cDNA for human thymidylate synthase.
AB  - We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone, pcHTS-1, encoding human thymidylate synthase (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) which was previously isolated from a human fibroblast expressible cDNA library and functional in mouse cells. The 1.6 kilobase cDNA insert of pcHTS-1 encodes a subunit protein of 313 amino acid (Mr = 35,706) and its predicted amino acid sequence is highly conserved in many regions including folylpolyglutamate and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate binding sites, when compared with those of Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, and bacteriophage T4. The cDNA contains in its 5'-untranslated region a triple tandemly repeated sequence consisting of 90 nucleotides, which starts immediately upstream of the ATG initiator codon, is very high in G+C content (80%), and can form three possible interconvertible stem-loop structures.
TI  - Affinity labeling of dihydrofolate reductase with an antifolate glyoxal.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductases from different species contain several highly conserved  arginines, some of which have been shown by x-ray crystallography to have their guanido groups near the p-aminobenzoyl glutamate moiety of enzyme-bound methotrexate. The orientation of one of these (Arg-52) appears to be completely reversed in comparing the crystal structures of Escherichia coli with Lactobacillus casei enzyme (Bolin, J. T., Filman, D. J., Matthews, D. A., Hamlin, R. C., and Kraut, J. (1982). J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13650-13662). We synthesized a novel antifolate containing a glyoxal group designed to react specifically with active-site guanido groups which are able to approach the p-aminobenzoyl carbonyl of methotrexate. The binding of this compound to the enzyme was competitive with dihydrofolate (DHF) in ordinary buffers. In borate buffer at pH 8.0 it inactivated dihydrofolate reductases from both E. coli and L. casei at similar maximum rates, while the chicken liver enzyme was more slowly inactivated. The inactivation was stoichiometric, paralleled the loss of the glyoxal chromophore, and showed saturation kinetics. Inhibitor binding and thus inactivation was enhanced by NADPH, while DHF protected the enzyme. This allowed calculation of the Kd for DHF which was found to be identical with its Km. The stoichiometrically inactivated enzyme displayed the 340-nm chromophore characteristic of 4-aminopteridines bound to dihydrofolate reductase confirming active-site labeling with normal orientation of the ligand. The ligand remained covalently bound to inactivated enzyme upon denaturation at low pH but dissociated at neutral pH. Computer graphic modeling of the crystal structures predicted reaction of Arg-31 but not Arg-52 in L. casei dihydrofolate reductase and of only Arg-52 in the E. coli enzyme. Purification of the CNBr fragments from the inactivated enzymes gave a single labeled peptide for each species. The particular peptide tagged in each case was unaffected by the presence of NADPH and was in excellent agreement with the crystallographic predictions.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the thymidylate synthetase gene (thyP3) from the Bacillus  subtilis phage phi 3T.
AB  - The thyP3 gene, encoding thymidylate synthetase, from the Bacillus subtilis phage phi 3T has been cloned and the nucleotide sequence determined. The derived amino acid sequence indicates a subunit Mr of 32 748. The primary amino acid sequence is compared with the sequences of the analogous proteins specified by Escherichia coli (thyA), Lactobacillus casei, (thyA) and phage T4 (td). Extensive conservation exists in all four sequences implying a shared tertiary structure.
TI  - Reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  - Germfree (GF) F344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis (BCG). Specific pathogene-free (SPF) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. The rats colonized with Escherichia coli or Bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in SPF rats. The rats colonized with Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus casei, L. fermentum, L. murini, and L. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in GF rats. Furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of E. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in SPF rats. These results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of SPF rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, P. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and E. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Species-specific irreversible inhibition of Neisseria gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase by a substituted 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidine.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase undergoes a time-dependent, irreversible inactivation by 2,4-diamino-5-[3,5-dimethoxy-4-(p-bromoacetamidophenoxy)benzyl] pyrimidine. The kinetics of inactivation are consistent with the reversible formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex followed by covalent binding to the enzyme. The reversible component is competitive with dihydrofolate and has an inhibitor binding constant of 10 nM. Irreversible inactivation proceeds as a pseudo first-order process with a minimum inactivation half-time of 20 min and a Ki of 28 nM. Using radiolabeled inhibitor, it was shown that approximately 1 mol of ligand was covalently bound to the enzyme/mol of methotrexate binding site when the enzyme was completely inhibited. Radiolabeled inhibitor remained associated with the enzyme following denaturation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 14C-labeled enzyme-inhibitor complex yielded only one radioactive polypeptide, and sequence determinations showed that His-25 was modified by covalent attachment of the inhibitor. When dihydrofolate reductases from Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, SR-1 rodent lymphoma, and chicken liver were tested with the affinity label, only the L. casei enzyme showed a time-dependent increase in inhibition. These data, along with comparisons of known amino acid sequences and x-ray crystal structures, were used to make predictions concerning the three-dimensional conformation of the gonococcal enzyme.
TI  - Characterization and amino acid sequence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The enzyme showed a single component on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 18,000) and on isoelectric focusing in 5 M urea (pI = 6.8). Although gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions resolved the preparation into two enzymatically active proteins (called form 1 and form 2), they were not genetically determined isozymes. Both had a similar dihydrofolate Km (2 microM), NADPH Km (10 microM), and trimethoprim Ki (20 nM), and form 2 (the slower migrating species) was shown to be generated from form 1 by the electrophoresis conditions. The complete covalent structure of the enzyme has also been determined. It is a single polypeptide composed of 162 residues and containing 4 cysteines. The gonococcal dihydrofolate reductase shares a 35% homology with the chicken liver enzyme and a 40% homology with the Escherichia coli enzyme. Most of these identities are residues that have been implicated in the binding of NADPH and methotrexate to the E. coli and Lactobacillus casei reductases.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Toxicity of microbial products in cell culture.
AB  - Cytotoxicity of a mixed pyrogen preparation and its components as well as native  and radiodetoxified lipopolysacharides (LPS) was determined with established HEp-2 cell cultures and by measuring plating efficiency. This proved to be more sensitive to the damaging effect of both microbe-containing LPS (Escherichia coli) and purified LPS. Microorganisms without this compound (Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis) seem to be more infifferent on cells, even Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a marked augmenting effect on cell plating. Divergence in null-toxicity between the established cultures and plating efficiency makes it possible to presume that the primary effect of microorganisms on epithelial cells is medited by LPS, and the subsequent liberation of lysosomal proteinases is responsible for major biological effects.
TI  - Probing the infra-structure of thymidylate synthase and deoxycytidylate deaminase.
AB  - Methods are described for preparing and structurally analyzing two enzymes involved in the formation of dTMP, deoxycytidylate deaminase and thymidylate synthase. In the latter case, it has been possible through the use of recombinant DNA techniques with an amplification plasmid to obtain sufficient amounts of the E. coli and T4-phage synthases to complete the entire sequence of both enzymes by employing a combination of protein and DNA sequencing methods. A comparative analysis of the L. casei and E. coli synthases has revealed a 62% conservation of sequences but an even greater homology in their hydrophobic active site regions (82%), which are primarily hydrophobic in nature. The homology between these enzymes becomes apparent by deleting a 51 amino acid segment (residues 89-139) from the L. casei synthase, which accounts for the difference in size between these enzymes. Methods for obtaining the binding sites of both substrates are described, one being the activation of the carboxyls of folate with a water soluble carbodiimide and the other, the activation of dUMP by ultraviolet light. The DNA and protein sequence of the T4-phage synthase has recently been clarified by us and is in preparation. Of great interest is the finding by Purohit and Mathews (42), based on our sequence data for the synthase, that the gene segment for the carboxyl terminal end of dihydrofolate reductase overlaps with the amino end of the gene for thymidylate synthase. The complete amino acid sequence of T2-phage deoxycytidylate deaminase has been elucidated by conventional protein sequencing methods. The binding characteristics of this enzyme for its positive allosteric effectors and substrates, as determined by equilibrium dialysis, are consistent with the cooperative nature of its kinetic responses. Consistent with these findings was the demonstration that each of the enzyme's six subunits bound an equivalent amount of substrate or allosteric modifier. Similarly the deaminase showed a marked negative change in ellipticity at 280 nm in response to increasing concentrations of dCTP, changes which could be reversed by dTTP. From the information on the enzyme's primary sequence, it should be possible to define the substrate and allosteric binding regions within the deaminase with the appropriately activated compounds. A start in this direction has been initiated by the finding that dTTP is rapidly and apparently covalently fixed to the amino terminal cyanogen bromide peptide of the enzyme in the presence of ultraviolet light.
TI  - Trimethoprim binding to bacterial and mammalian dihydrofolate reductase: a comparison by proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance.
AB  - The binding of trimethoprim to dihydrofolate reductase from L1210 mouse lymphoma  cells has been studied by measuring the changes in chemical shift of nuclei of the ligand that accompanying binding. The 6- and 2',6'-proton chemical shifts of bound trimethoprim have been determined by transfer of saturation experiments, and the 2-carbon chemical shift has been determined by using [2-13C]trimethoprim. The changes in proton chemical shift are substantially smaller than those accompanying binding to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase [Cayley, P. J., Albrand, J. P., Feeney, J., Robert, G. C. K., Piper, E. A., & Burgen, A. S. V. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 3886]. It is shown that this difference arises largely from the fact that trimethoprim adopts different conformations when bound to mammalian and to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. The proton chemical shifts are interpreted in terms of ring-current contributions from the two aromatic rings of trimethoprim itself and the nearby aromatic amino acid residues of the enzyme. The latter have been located by using the refined crystallographic coordinates of the Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli reductases in their complexes with methotrexate [Bolin, J. T., Filman, D. J., Matthews, D. A. & Kraut, J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13650], under the assumption that, as indicated by the 13C chemical shifts, the diaminopyrimidine ring of trimethoprim binds in the same way as does the corresponding part of methotrexate. With use of these assumptions, the conformation of trimethoprim bound to the dihydrofolate reductases from L. casei, E. coli, and L1210 cells has been calculated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of the type I trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase specified by the Escherichia coli R-plasmid R483: comparison with procaryotic and eucaryotic dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  - We have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1,626-base-pair fragment from R-plasmid R483 which encodes a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames, each sufficient to encode polypeptides of approximately 17,000 daltons. Both open regions are preceded by sequences conforming closely to the canonical description of procaryotic promoters. A 490-base-pair HpaI fragment spanning one of the potential coding regions was inserted into a plasmid vector under the transcriptional control of the trp promoter. Cells transformed with this plasmid were trimethoprim resistant and produced dihydrofolate reductase activity which in vitro was resistant to moderate levels of trimethoprim. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein indicated that the R483-encoded trimethoprim-resistant enzyme was distantly related to the trimethoprim-sensitive bacterial homologs. The conserved amino acids were localized primarily to the region of the enzyme previously shown to comprise the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket.
TI  - Alpha-pyridine nucleotides as substrates for a plasmid-specified dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The alpha epimers of pyridine nucleotides are almost totally inactive as reductants in dehydrogenase reactions. In contrast, the R plasmid R67-specified dihydrofolate reductase (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) isolated from trimethoprim-resistant Escherichia coli utilized alpha-NADPH and alpha-NADH in addition to the "normal" beta-epimers. The enzymes from bacterial and mammalian sources used only beta-NADPH and beta-NADH. THe Km value for alpha-NADPH (16 microM) was 4-fold greater than that for beta-NADPH (4 microM), while the maximal velocity of the alpha-NADPH-catalyzed reaction was 70% of that seen with the beta-NADPH. beta-NADP+ and alpha-NADP+ were competitive inhibitors of the R67 enzyme. Pyridine nucleotide analogues such as deamino- and acetyl-NADPH were used readily by bacterial, plasmid, and mammalian enzymes, whereas thio-NADPH was used only by the plasmid enzyme. These data suggest that the enzyme from R plasmid R67 possesses a pyridine nucleotide binding site different from that of other dihydrofolate reductases and dehydrogenases.
TI  - Novel fluorinated antifolates. Enzyme inhibition and cytotoxicity studies on 2'-  and 3'-fluoroaminopterin.
AB  - Two novel analogues of aminopterin with a single fluorine substitution in the 2'  (compound 8) or in the 3' (compound 9) position of the p-aminobenzoyl group were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase from two bacterial species and from human HeLa cells. The 2'-fluoro compound was bound essentially the same as aminopterin itself, while the 3'-fluoro derivative bound two- to threefold more tightly in all cases. UV spectral shifts indicated normal binding of the pteridine. Cytotoxicity studies against mouse leukemia L1210 cells and the human stomach cancer line HuTu80 indicated equivalent toxicity of the parent drug with the 2'-fluoro analogue. 3'-Fluoroaminopterin was, however, twice as toxic as aminopterin to both cell lines.
TI  - Primary structure of the Escherichia coli thyA gene and its thymidylate synthase  product.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 1,163-base-pair fragment that encodes the entire thyA gene of Escherichia coli K-12 was determined. The strategy involved sequence determination of both DNA strands by using overlapping deletions that had been generated in vitro from the two ends of the fragment with BAL-31 nuclease. The amino-terminal sequence of thymidylate synthase (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45), the product of the thyA gene, located the 792-base-pair open reading frame, which codes for the 264 amino acid residues of this enzyme. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide data was confirmed to the extent of 40% by partial sequence analysis of the enzyme purified from extracts of the amplified cloned gene. Transcriptional and translational control areas were apparent in the regions flanking the structural gene. The 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate-binding residue of the active site was identified as cysteine-146. Comparison of the E. coli and Lactobacillus casei synthase sequences reveals consistent homology (62%) over extensive regions. This homology is particularly striking in a very hydrophobic region bordering cysteine-146. In the two enzymes, this region, which probably defines the active site, is 82% homologous. However, a dramatic difference between the two sequences is reflected by the surprising finding that a 51-amino-acid stretch, present midway through the L. casei sequence, is completely absent from the E. coli enzyme.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase gene of  Lactobacillus casei in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Lactose metabolism in Lactobacillus casei 64H is associated with the presence of  plasmid pLZ64. This plasmid determines both phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase uptake of lactose and beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase. A shotgun clone bank of chimeric plasmids containing restriction enzyme digest fragments of pLZ64 DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12. One clone contained the gene coding for beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase on a 7.9-kilobase PstI fragment cloned into the vector pBR322 in E. coli strain chi 1849. The beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase enzyme isolated from E. coli showed no difference from that isolated from L. casei, and specific activity of beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase was stimulated 1.8-fold in E. coli by growth in media containing beta-galactosides. A restriction map of the recombinant plasmid was compiled, and with that information, a series of subclones was constructed. From an analysis of the proteins produced by minicells prepared from transformant E. coli cells containing each of the recombinant subclone plasmids, it was found that the gene for the 56-kilodalton beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase was transcribed from an L. casei-derived promoter. The gene for a second protein product (43 kilodaltons) was transcribed in the opposite direction, presumably under the control of a promoter in pBR322. The relationship of this second product to the lactose metabolism genes of L. casei is at present unknown.
TI  - Crystal structures of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase refined at 1.7 A resolution. II. Environment of bound NADPH and implications for catalysis.
AB  - New details of NADPH binding to Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase have  become visible as a result of crystallographic refinement to an R factor of 0.152 at 1.7 A resolution. Conformational torsion angles for bound NADPH have been extensively revised and specific interatomic contacts responsible for cofactor binding have been identified. In addition, several structurally conserved water molecules are seen to mediate the protein-ligand interaction. In the nicotinamide binding site three oxygen atoms of the enzyme lie in the plane of the pyridine ring and close to ring carbons 2, 4, and 6. The placement of these polar groups suggests that the enzyme stabilizes a C4-carbonium electronic isomer of oxidized nicotinamide in the transition state. Pyramidalization of ring nitrogen N1 in the transition state might be promoted by a fixed water molecule positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the N1 lone pair orbital. Pyramidalization could also relieve an unfavorable steric contact due to the observed rotation of the nicotinamide's carboxamide group by 180 degrees from its most stable conformation.
TI  - Crystal structures of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase refined at 1.7 A resolution. I. General features and binding of methotrexate.
AB  - X-ray data have been extended to 1.7 A for a binary complex of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase with methotrexate and a ternary complex of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase with methotrexate and NADPH. Models for both structures have been refined to R factors of 0.15 and include parameters for fixed and liquid solvent. The two species of dihydrofolate reductase resemble one another even more closely than was thought to be the case prior to refinement. Several new structural features have also been discovered. Among them are a cis peptide linking Gly-97 and Gly-98 (L. Casei numbering) in both species, an alpha helix involving residues 43 through 50 in the E. coli enzyme, and the existence of what may be a specific hydration site on exposed alpha helices. Refinement has led to a revised description of the details of methotrexate binding. We now see that a fixed water molecule mediates the interaction between methotrexate's 2-amino group and Thr-116 (L. casei numbering) and that the inhibitor's 4-amino group makes two hydrogen bonds with the enzyme (instead of one). Other revisions are also discussed. A hypothetical model for substrate binding is proposed in which the pteridine ring is turned upside down while all protein and solvent atoms remain fixed. Asp-26 in this model is hydrogen bonded to the substrate's 2-amino group and to N3.

TI  - Comparison of the inhibition of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase by 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted-benzyl)pyrimidines: quantitative structure-activity relationships, X-ray crystallography, and computer graphics in structure-activity analysis.
AB  - The inhibition constants (Kiapp) obtained from the action of 44 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted-benzyl)pyrimidines on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei bacteria are used to derive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). These equations bring out a number of differences in the DHFR which can be understood at the atomic level by studying color stereo computer graphics models constructed from the X-ray coordinates of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The combination of QSAR and X-ray crystallography interpreted via high-performance computer graphics offers a new level of sophistication to extend our understanding of enzyme-ligand interactions, which, when the crystallography is known, opens up a more scientific approach to drug development.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the gene for dihydrofolate reductase from Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The Lactobacillus casei gene for dihydrofolate reductase has been cloned in Escherichia coli using the multicopy vector pBR322. A restriction map of the cloned DNA has been prepared. The cloned DNA directs the synthesis of L. casei dihydrofolate reductase in E. coli and confers trimethoprim and methotrexate resistance.
TI  - Nuclear magnetic resonance study of dihydrofolate reductase labeled with [gamma-13C]tryptophan.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase isozyme 2 of Streptococcus faecium has been labeled with  13C in the C gamma position of tryptophan residues by growing the organism on a defined medium containing L-[gamma-13C]tryptophan (90% 13C). The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the enzyme shows four well-resolved resonances which have nuclear Overhauser enhancements of 1.1-1.3. Values of T1 (spin-lattice relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin relaxation time) are significantly less than predicted for an isotropically rotating, rigid sphere with no intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Three of the resonances have chemical shifts downfield from the 13C resonance of urea-denatured enzyme by amounts up to 1.43 ppm. The chemical shift of resonance 4 in the spectrum is 4.0 ppm upfield from Trp C gamma of urea-denatured enzyme. This large upfield shift is attributed to electric field effects generated by polar side chains. The two more upfield peaks both provide evidence that the corresponding tryptophan residues, WC and WD, each undergo chemical exchange between alternative microenvironments. In the case of WC, which gives a resonance with two components, exchange is slow (ve, exchange rate much less than 55 s-1), and the relative populations of the two stable states are in the ratio 2:3. WD is apparently in intermediate to fast exchange on the NMR time scale. With a two-state model, ve increases from approximately 90 to 150 s-1 as the temperature is increased from 5 to 25 degrees C. This increases in temperature is also accompanied by an increase in the fractional population of the minor downfield state(s), from about 0.062 at 5 degrees C to 0.24 at 25 degrees C. However, the data may also be interpreted as a temperature-dependent equilibrium between a continuum of many states. WD is tentatively identified with Trp-22 since comparison of the sequences of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase and S. faecium dihydrofolate reductase and inspection of the crystal structure of the L. casei enzyme indicate that Trp-6, Trp-115, and Trp-160 are probably all involved in regions of beta sheet whereas Trp-22 is in a loop joining beta A to alpha B. Earlier crystallographic evidence for the Escherichia coli reductase suggests that in the methotrexate complex with this enzyme the corresponding loop has a good deal of flexibility. It is probable that in the uncomplexed S. faecium reductase the motion of this loop is the major mechanism for the exchange process involving Trp-22. The upfield chemical shift of resonance 4 is attributed to electric field effects on C gamma of Trp-22 produced by the carboxylate groups of Asp-27 and Asp-9. On the basis of the small difference between the chemical shift of resonance 3 and that of tryptophan C gamma in urea-denatured reductase, it is suggested that WC may be identified with Trp-6.
TI  - Pteroylpolyglutamates.
AB  - Reduced derivatives of the vitamin pteroylglutamic acid (folic acid) are essential coenzymes for the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, methionine, thymidylate and for many other enzyme catalyzed reactions involving the transfer, oxidation and reduction of single carbon units. Pteroylglutamic acid is found in tissues in the form of poly-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of varying chain length. The present review covers the detection, distribution, synthesis, degradation, coenzyme function and inhibitory activities of pteroyl-gamma-glutamates. The biosynthesis and inhibitory activities of poly-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of methotrexate, an analog of pteroylglutamic acid having antitumor activity, are also considered. An hypothesis on the coenzymatic role of pteroylpoly-gamma-glutamates in the coordination of sequential enzymatic steps in the metabolism of single carbon units is presented.
TI  - Methotrexate and folate binding to dihydrofolate reductase. Separate characterization of the pteridine and p-aminobenzoyl binding sites by resonance Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - By using 324- and 350.6-nm excitation, it is possible to obtain selectively the resonance Raman spectra of the p-aminobenzoyl and pteridine chromophores, respectively, within methotrexate (MTX) or folate. Thus, for a single ligand, by changing the wavelength for excitation, the geometric conformations of both chromophores can be monitored separately. Resonance Raman spectra are reported for MTX bound to dihydrofolate reductases from Escherichia coli and from Lactobacillus casei, in each case in the presence and absence of NADPH. Additionally, some data are presented for enzyme-bound folate. The resonance Raman data support the conclusions of other workers that MTX binds with its pteridine ring protonated while the pteridine ring within folate is bound as a neutral species. However, for MTX, marked differences exist between the electronic distribution in the protonated pteridine ring for the ligand free in solution and for the bound species. The rearrangement of the pteridine electrons over and above that accompanying protonation explains the absorption properties of bound MTX, and together with protonation may account in part for the high affinity of MTX for the enzyme. The resonance Raman spectra show that slight differences exists between the pteridine sites for MTX in the three dihydrofolate reductases studied while no differences could be detected among the p-aminobenzoyl sites. In each MTX-protein complex, however, there appears to be a marked change in the geometry of the amide group in the benzoyl linkage of MTX compared to the geometry found in the free ligand. The resonance Raman spectra of MTX bound to the enzymes were unchanged upon the addition of the cofactor NADPH, indicating that the cofactor does not bring about marked electron rearrangement in the bound ligands.
TI  - [Proteins specifically binding thiamine and their biological role].

TI  - Primary structure of chicken liver dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The complete covalent structure of dihydrofolate reductase from chicken liver is  described. The S-carboxymethylated protein was subjected to cleavage by cyanogen bromide which produced five fragments. Fragment CB2 contained an internal homoserine residue which was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. Sequences and ordering of the cyanogen bromide fragments were established by means of automated sequencer analyses of the fragments and from smaller peptides generated by proteolysis with trypsin and staphylococcal protease. The covalent structure of the single polypeptide chain comprises 189 residues of molecular weight 21,651. The chicken liver enzyme is homologous to that from L1210 cells and shows regions of homology to dihydrofolate reductases from Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus casei. These homologous regions in the chicken liver enzyme are primarily related to conserved amino acid residues implicated in the binding of NADPH and methotrexate by bacterial dihydrofolate reductases.

TI  - Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the binding of trimethoprim to dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  - The resonances of the aromatic protons of trimethoprim [2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine] in its complexes with dihydrofolate reductases from Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli cannot be directly observed. Their chemical shifts have been determined by transfer of saturation experiments and by difference spectroscopy using [2',6'-2H2]trimethoprim. The complex of 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4'-dimethoxy-5'-bromobenzyl)pyrimidine with the L. casei enzyme has also been examined. At room temperature, the 2',6'-proton resonance of bound trimethoprim is very broad (line width great than 30 Hz); with the E. coli enzyme, the resonance sharpens with increasing temperature so as to be clearly visible by difference spectroscopy at 45 degrees C. This line broadening is attributed to an exchange contribution, arising from the slow rate of "flipping" about the C7-C1' bond of bound trimethoprim. The transfer of saturation measurements were also used to determine the dissociation rate constants of the complexes. In the course of these experiments, a decrease in intensity of the resonance of the 2',6'-proton resonance of free trimethoprim on irradiation at the resonance of the 6 proton of free trimethoprim was observed, which only occurred in the presence of the enzyme. This is interpreted as a nuclear Overhauser effect between two protons of the bound ligand transferred to those of the free ligand by the exchange of the ligand between the two states. The chemical shift changes observed on the binding of trimethoprim to dihydrofolate reductase are interpreted in terms of the ring-current shift contributions from the two aromatic rings of trimethoprim and from that of phenylalanine-30. On the basis of this analysis of the chemical shifts, a model for the structure of the enzyme-trimethoprim complex is proposed. This model is consistent with the (indirect) observation of a nuclear Overhauser effect between the 2',6' and 6 protons of bound trimethoprim.
TI  - Microbial determinations by flow cytometry.
AB  - Recent improvements in the optics and electronics of flow cytometry systems, as well as in staining techniques, permit the assay of such minute cellular constituents as the DNA and protein contents of micro-organisms. To assess the usefulness of this technique, DNA and protein content distributions were determined in Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Chlorella kessleri 8k, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida utilis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Euglena gracilis. Investigations of the DNA content distributions of polyploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that the method can be used to determine ploidy. The rapidity of flow cytometry measurements allows accurate determinations in large populations.
TI  - Increased synthesis of ribonucleotide reductase after deoxyribonucleic acid inhibition in various species of bacteria.
AB  - The specific activity of ribonucleotide reductase was found to increase significantly after deoxyribonucleic acid inhibition in seven species of bacteria investigated. This group of bacteria includes species with B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase as well as some with an Escherichia coli-type ribonucleotide reductase.
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
TI  - The amino acid sequence of dihydrofolate reductase from the mouse lymphoma L1210.
AB  - The determination of the amino acid sequence of the dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) from cells of the mouse lymphoma L1210 is described. The protein was cleaved by cyanogen bromide to produce the six fragments CB1 (residues 1 to 14), CB2 (residues 15 to 52), CB3 (residues 53 to 111), CB4 (residues 115 to 125), CB5 (residues 126 to 139), and CB6 (residues 140 to 186). One of the fragments, CB2, contained an internal homoserine derived from a methionine which was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The amino acid sequences and order of the cyanogen bromide fragments were determined by a combination of automatic and manual sequence analyses of the fragments and small peptides from tryptic, thermolytic, and Staphylococcus aureus protease digestions. The complete sequence comprises 186 residues in a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 21,458. Comparison of the sequence of the L1210 dihydrofolate reductase with the sequences of the enzymes from Streptococcus faecium, escherichia coli RT500, and Lactobacillus casei indicates that all enzymes show some homology, which is strongest in the regions forming the substrate binding cleft.
TI  - [Results of measuring the modulus of elasticity of microorganism cell walls].
AB  - The elasticity modulus of Escherichia coli cell walls was found to change in the  course of growth of the culture. It decreased in the middle of the exponential phase, apparently as a result of intensification of biosynthetic and related to them transport processes at this period. If the cells were treated with EDTA, their elasticity modulus was lower, by an order of magnitude, than that of the control cell walls. If the cells were treated with lysozyme, the elasticity modulus of their walls decreased by three orders of magnitude. The elasticity modulus of cell walls was less in gram-positive rods than in E. coli. The elasticity modulus of spherical cells cannot be determined using this technique.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductase from amethopterin-resistant Lactobacillus casei. Sequences of the cyanogen bromide peptides and complete sequences of the enzyme.
AB  - The complete amino acid sequence of dihydrofolate reductase from an amethopterin-resistant strain of Lactobacillus casei has been determined by sequence analysis of peptides produced by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, staphylococcal protease, and myxobacter protease. Comparison of this sequence with those of reductases from other bacterial sources shows that the enzymes are homologous. The Lactobacillus casei reductase sequences shows a 29% sequence identity with that of the Escherichia coli enzyme and a 34% identity with the sequence of the enzyme from Streptococcus faecium. The NH2-terminal 68 residues of the L. casei reductase show a 54% sequence identity with that of the enzyme from S. faecium.

TI  - Dihydrofolate reductases in some folate-requiring bacteria with low trimethoprim  susceptibility.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductases from the folate-requiring strains Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7496, and Pediococcus cerevisiae ATCC 8081, as well as from Lactobacillus arabinosus, which is not dependent on exogenous folate, were isolated, and their properties were compared to reductases of Escherichia coli B, Staphylococcus aureus, and rat liver reductase. An inhibition profile with six different inhibitors revealed significant differences among all enzymes. All lactobacilli reductases are less sensitive to trimethoprim than the enzymes of E. coli and S. aureus, the reductase of P. cerevisiae requiring a concentration at least 1,000 times higher for 50% inhibition. Inhibition of growth of S. faecalis by pyrimethamine and 2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropyl-pteridine was seen to be much stronger than was predicted from the enzymatic data.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  - Against Enterobacter aerogenes 13048, Serratia marcescens 13880, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Escherichia coli 9723, Lactobacillus casei 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum 8014, Leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and Streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. In addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at pH 7, as compared with that of amphotericin B, at 2 micrograms/ml.
TI  - The effects of temperature and growth rate on the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in bacterial lipids.
AB  - The effects of temperature and growth rate on the fatty acid composition of the extractable lipids of four mesophilic and three psychotrophic bacteria were examined. Two of the mesophiles (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their lipids with decreasing temperature over their whole growth temperature range. The other mesophiles (Enterobacter aerogenes and Lactobacillus casei) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids with decreasing temperature only over the lower half of their growth temperature ranges. The psychrotrophs Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter sp. had a constant proportion of unsaturated acids over the lower half of their growth temperature range, while the psychotrophic Lactobacillus sp. showed no consistent change in its unsaturated fatty acid composition with temperature. All species showed some variation of unsaturated fatty acid composition with growth rate at the highest and lowest growth temperatures, although such variations were small in some species (Ent. aerogenes and Lactobacillus sp.).

TI  - Relationship of cytochrome content to the sensitivity of bacteria to NaCl on freezing and thawing.
AB  - Eight species of bacteria representing rod, coccus, gram-positive, and gram-negative forms were tested for their sensitivity to sodium chloride during freezing and thawing. Six of the eight species tested were salt-sensitive, though to different degrees, while Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis were resistant. Escherichia coli grown anaerobically exhibited only 38% of the salt sensitivity of aerobically grown cells. Analysis of cytochrome pigments in the organisms revealed that the six sensitive organisms all contained these pigments but in varying amounts, while the two resistant ones were devoid of them. Anaerobically grown E. coli contained 50% of the cytochromes of aerobically grown cells. A relationship between cytochrome content of the organisms and salt sensitivity during freezing and thawing was demonstrated with a correlation coefficient of 0.76 (P less than 0.05); the higher the cytochrome content, the more salt-sensitive the organism. This indicated that 58% of the salt sensitivity was due to the cytochrome content. Using a model organism E. coli, the effect of salt during freezing and thawing on the respiratory activity was examined. Freezing and thawing in water or saline decreased the respiration by whole cells of substrates expected to be NAD-linked while NADH-stimulated respiration was increased. In cell-free extracts derived from unfrozen cells or those frozen and thawed in water or saline, the respiration of ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) was constant. The respiration of NADH, succinate, and lactate in cell-free extracts derived from cells frozen and thawed in saline was reduced compared with those extracts derived from unfrozen cells or cells frozen and thawed in water. Studies with E. coli showed that the decreased respiratory activity caused by disruptions in the electron-transport chain could not account for the salt sensitivity on freezing and thawing. More likely, salt sensitivity is related to the presence of bonds between cytochromes and other membrane components which are disrupted by sodium chloride on freezing and thawing. This would then result in loss of membrane integrity and function.
TI  - Antifolate studies. Activities of 40 potential antimalarial compounds against sensitive and chlorguanide triazine resistant strains of folate-requiring bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - As part of the search for new antimalarial drugs, a screening program was developed using sensitive and chlorguanide triazine (CGT, cycloguanil) resistant strains of the folate-requiring bacteria, Streptococcus faecium durans, Lactobacillus casei, and Pediococcus cerevisiae. The activities of 40 compounds have been studied against these strains and Escherichia coli. Observations have been made on the points of 50% growth inhibition, the fold increase of resistance shown to each compound by the resistant strains as compared with the parent sensitive strains, and the reversal of growth inhibition by folic acid with S. faecium and L. casei by folinic acid with P. cerevisiae and by p-aminobenzoic acid with E. coli. Comparisons have been made of the activities of the test compounds with those of the standard antimalarial antifoltes, CGT and pyrimethamine (PM), and the antibacterial results have been compared with the activities of the compounds against Plasmodium berghei infections in the mouse and against human malaria infections where data are available. Of the 17 compounds reversed by folates, five had patterns of activity similar to CGT and PM in that they were most active against S. faecium and nine compounds exhibited a different pattern, being highly active against all four test bacteria. This suggests that these latter compounds either have different pharmacokinetic properties or have additional modes of action. The three CGT-resistant organisms responded to antifolates in different ways. S. faecium (R) and P. cerevisiae (R) strains were cross resistant to 4,6-diaminotriazines, 2,4-diaminopyrimidines, 2,4-diaminoquinazolines, and active 2,4-diaminopteridines. L. casei (R) was cross resistant to the triazines but was collaterally sensitive to all the other antifolates. Most of the compounds not reversed by folates were much less inhibitory for the test organisms; they were most active against L. casei. In general, their growth inhibitory concentrations varied less for the four test organisms and the responses of the sensitive and CGTR strains were similar. However, there was some cross resistance to five compounds and some collateral sensitivity to five others. Comparison of the bacteriological data with the activities of the compounds against Plasmodium berghei in the mouse showed little correlation between the two test systems; each appears to provide independent and useful information.

AB  - A strain of Lactobacillus casei from a pharmaceutical preparation became established in the digestive tract of an axenic child. It was eliminated by the first bacteria occurring after inoculation of the child's digestive tract with a human flora, before the child was taken out of the isolator. Using "gnotoxenic" mice, we found that the elimination of L. casei was due to a bactericidal effect of the Escherichia coli of human origin, within the digestive tract.
TI  - Transport and utilization of methyltetrahydrofolates by Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Transport of labeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-H4PteGlu) and 5-methyl-H4PteGlu5 by Lactobacillus casei was via a carrier-mediated system. Both the natural (l) and unnatural (d) diastereoisomers were transported. Active transport was only demonstrated with the monoglutamate. Comparisons of growth rates with transport rates demonstrated that pteroypolyglutamates were more effectively utilized by L. casei than the monglutamate derivatives. The rate-limiting step in the utilization of higher polyglutamates was their transport into the cell, and in the case of the oxidized polyglutamates, their reduction. Utilization of monoglutamates was not limited by their transport but by metabolism, which also explains the different types of growth response curves observed between monoglutamates and higher polyglutamates. This phenomenon, sometimes called positive drift, prevents normalization of these growth curves. The rate-limiting step with the monoglutamates appears to be either the metabolism of 5-methyl-H4PteGlu or their conversion to polyglutamate forms.

Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.

The 3- and 4-methyl- and 3- and 4-phenylglutamic acids did not inhibit Plasmodium berghei and were nontoxic to the host (mice) at 640 mg/kg. The five analogs in addition to 2-methlglutamic acid were inactive against Lactobacillus casei at 1000 mug/ml in a defined medium: against Escherichia coli, only 2-methylglutamic acid caused 27% inhibition at 10,000 mug/ml. All six analogs failed to inhibit Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Trichoderma viride, and Myrothecium verrucaria in a defined medium below 10,000 mug/ml.
TI  - Partial purification and properties of an enzyme from Escherichia coli that catalyzes the conversion of glutamic acid and 10-formyltetrahydropteroylglutamic acid to 10-formyltetrahydropterol-gamma-glutamyglutamic acid.
AB  - An enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of L-glutamic acid and 10-formyl-H4folic  acid (also known as 10-formyl-H4pteroylglutamic acid) to 10-formyl-H4pteroyl-gamma-glutamylglutamic acid has been purified by 74-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli. ATP, Mg-2+, and a monovalent cation (K+ or NH-4, but not Na+) are required for the enzyme to function. Radioactive and bioautographic analyses revealed the formation of a single product. This product was identified as 10-formyl-H-4pteroyl-gamma-glutamylglutamic acid from its spectral characteristics, its ability to be used effectively as a growth faster for Lactobacillus casei 7469, and from radioactive analysis that indicated the incorporation into the product of 1 mol glutamate/mol of 10-formyl-H-4pteroylglutamic acid utilized. The enzyme functions optimally at pH 9.0-9.8 and at 50 degrees. Its molecular weight is estimated at 42,000-43,000. The Km values are 180 muM for L-glutamic acid and less than 2 muM for (-) 10-formyl-H-4pteroylglutamic acid. The only other naturally occurring folate compounds with significant activity as substrate are H-4pteroylglutamic acid and 5,10-methylene-H-4pteroylglutamic acid; however, these compounds are not used as effectively (K-m values are 10-12 mu-M) as 10-formyl-H-4pteroylglutamic acid.

This method of disrupton was effective for cells in the following genera: Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Escherichia.

This investigation shows that Coulter counting can provide reliable estimates of microbial numbers in mixed cultures. Precautions and limitations of Coulter counting in mixed cultures are discussed.
TI  - Spiral plate method for bacterial determination.
AB  - A method is described for determining the number of bacteria in a solution by the use of a machine which deposits a known volume of sample on a rotating agar plate in an ever decreasing amount in the form of an Archimedes spiral. After the sample is incubated, different colony densities are apparent on the surface of the plate. A modified counting grid is described which relates area of the plate of volume of sample. By counting an appropriate area of the plate, the number of bacteria in the sample is estimated. This method was compared to the pour plate procedure with the use of pure and mixed cultures in water and milk. The results did not demonstrate a significant difference in variance between duplicates at the alpha = 0.01 level when concentrations of 600 to 12 x 10(5) bacteria per ml were used, but the spiral plate method gave counts that were higher than counts obtained by the pour plate method. The time and materials required for this method are substantially less than those required for the conventional aerobic pour plate procedure.

AB  - Diazouracil (DZU) was shown to increase the mean cell volume of several bacterial species. The filaments which it induced with Escherichia coli B and Lactobacillus casei were examined in section by electron microscopy. In addition to the inhibition of division of E. coli by DZU, its effects were studied on mass increase, viability, and deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis. The dependence of cell age on the division-inhibitory effect of DZU was examined in synchronous cultures. The division-inhibitory effect was not reversed by pantoyllactone, an antagonist of ultraviolet filamentation, or by l-tyrosine, which had been reported to antagonize DZU activity.

AB  - Guirard, Beverly M. (University of California, Berkeley), and Esmond E. Snell. Effect of polyamine structure on growth and spermine and spermidine content of lactic acid bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 88:72-80. 1964.-Growth from small inocula of six species of lactobacilli was stimulated by addition of spermine or spermidine to a defined medium; none of four streptococcal species showed this effect. Lactobacillus casei was stimulated to the greatest extent. Several homologues and analogues partially duplicated the growth-promoting effects of spermidine; one inactive homologue, N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,6-hexanediamine, competitively inhibited the growth response to spermidine and spermine, and reduced or eliminated the response to several weakly active compounds. A procedure for separation of spermine and spermidine, and their estimation by bioassay with L. casei, was developed and applied to the estimation of these compounds in bacterial cells. Both compounds are present in lactic acid bacteria in amounts much smaller (1 to 5%) than those found in Escherichia coli. Addition of spermine or spermidine to the growth medium results in large accumulations in the cells, and the two amines show limited interconvertibility. Putrescine does not increase the cell content of either spermine or spermidine. Presence of the inhibitor prevents accumulation of the growth-stimulating amines. The polyamines appear to fill at least two valuable roles in the cell, one relatively nonspecific in its structural requirements, and one filled only by spermine and spermidine or their nearest homologues. N-(3-aminopropyl)-1,6-hexanediamine appears to prevent the latter function by competition for an appropriate cellular receptor.
