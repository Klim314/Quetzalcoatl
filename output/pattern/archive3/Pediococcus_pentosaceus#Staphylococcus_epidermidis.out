lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria-inhibited staphylococcus epidermidis.
introduction: lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria are able to produce antimicrobial compounds to inhibit opportunisticwounding skin pathogen. the antimicrobial compounds produced are organic acids, putative bacteriocin, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl. staphylococcus epidermidis is well-known as an opportunistic wounding skin pathogen in wound infections related to implanted medical devices. objective: to screen 87 strains of lab and 3 strains of bifidobacteria for antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus epidermidis.additionally, this study sought to determine and quantify types of antimicrobial compounds produced by lab. materials and methods: inhibitory activity of lab and bifidobacteria on s. epidermidis was assessed with the spectrophotometric method using a 96-well microplate reader. characterization of cell-free supernatant (cfs) was done using analytical methods. lactobacillus fermentum (collected by the bioprocess department at the universiti sains malaysia [bd]) 1912d, lactobacillus casei bd 1415b, lactobacillus fermentum bd 8313a, pediococcus pentosaceus bd 1913b, and weissella cibaria (collected by the food technology department at the universiti sains malaysia [ftdc]) 8643 with high percentage of inhibition (p < 0.05), ranging from 73.7% to 88.2%, as compared to the control, were selected for subsequent analyses. upon neutralization, the antimicrobial activity showed a drastic drop (p < 0.05) in the percentage of inhibition. concentrations of the inhibitive metabolites were produced in varying amounts and were strain dependent. results: results demonstrated that lactic acid in all strains was produced in a more predominant amount than acetic acid. protein concentration production ranged from 0.081-0.215 mg/ml. l. fermentum bd 1912d yielded as much as 0.014 mg/ml hydrogen peroxide, which was significantly higher than other strains studied. diacetyl was produced in a higher concentration by weissella cibaria ftdc 8643 at 2.884 ng/ml; the lowest concentration of 0.465 ng/ml was produced by ped. pentosaceus bd 1913b. conclusion: antimicrobial metabolites from cfs of lactic acid bacteria were effective in repressing the growth of opportunistic wounding dermal pathogen staphylococcus epidermidis.
bacteriocin activity against various pathogens produced by pediococcus pentosaceus vj13 isolated from idly batter.
bacteriocins, an antimicrobial peptide, is known to have wide spectrum antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. because they are easily digested in the intestine, they are considered as safe and are widely used as food preservatives. hence their purification and characterization have attracted considerable attraction, especially for those having activity against human pathogens. in this study, the bacteriocin produced by pediococcus pentosaceus vj13 was precipitated with cold acetone and purified by gel permeation chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. the bacteriocin exhibited antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, like mycobacterium smegmatis, klebsiella pneumonia, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus epidermidis. the activity of bacteriocin was lost completely after treatment with protease, which revealed its proteinaceous nature. the bacteriocin was stable up to 100 degrees c and exhibited antilisterial property which is a characteristic feature of class iia bacteriocins. it was active within the ph range of 2-8 and stable against various chemicals and denaturants. tricine sds-page revealed its molecular weight to be 4.0 kda, where the corresponding activity against listeria monocytogenes was also noted. treatment of l. monocytogenes with bacteriocin decreased the viable cell count, and scanning electron microscope analysis revealed membrane pore formation that resulted in the release of intracellular content, suggesting its bactericidal effect.
the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.
