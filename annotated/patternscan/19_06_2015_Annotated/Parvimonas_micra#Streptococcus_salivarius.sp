TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of streptococcus salivarius k12 on bacteria involved in oral malodour.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin-producing strain streptococcus salivarius k12 against several bacteria involved in halitosis. design: the inhibitory activity of s. salivarius k12 against solobacterium moorei ccug39336, four clinical s. moorei isolates, atopobium parvulum atcc33793 and eubacterium sulci atcc35585 was examined by a deferred antagonism test. eubacterium saburreum atcc33271 and parvimonas micra atcc33270,  which have been tested in previous studies, served as positive controls, and the  gram-negative strain bacteroides fragilis zib2800 served as a negative control. additionally, the occurrence of resistance in s. moorei ccug39336 to s. salivarius k12 was analysed by either direct plating or by passage of s. moorei ccug39336 on chloroform-inactived s. salivarius k12-containing agar plates. results: s. salivarius k12 suppressed the growth of all gram-positive bacteria tested, but the extent to which the bacteria were inhibited varied. e. sulci atcc35585 was the most sensitive strain, while all five s. moorei isolates were inhibited to a lesser extent. natural resistance seems to be very low in s. moorei ccug39336, and there was only a slight decrease in sensitivity after exposure to s. salivarius k12 over 10 passages. conclusion: our studies demonstrate that s. salivarius k12 has antimicrobial activity against bacteria involved in halitosis. this strain might be an interesting and valuable candidate for the development of an antimicrobial therapy for halitosis.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.
