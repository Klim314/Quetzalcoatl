TI  - Occurrence of bacteriophages infecting Aeromonas, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella in water and association with contamination sources in Thailand.
AB  - The co-residence of bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts in humans, animals,  and environmental sources directed the use of bacteriophages to track the origins of the pathogenic bacteria that can be found in contaminated water. The objective of this study was to enumerate bacteriophages of Aeromonas caviae (AecaKS148), Enterobacter sp. (EnspKS513), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KlpnKS648) in water and evaluate their association with contamination sources (human vs. animals). Bacterial host strains were isolated from untreated wastewater in Bangkok, Thailand. A double-layer agar technique was used to detect bacteriophages. All three bacteriophages were detected in polluted canal samples, with likely contamination from human wastewater, whereas none was found in non-polluted river samples. AecaKS148 was found to be associated with human fecal sources, while EnspKS513 and KlpnKS648 seemed to be equally prevalent in both human and animal fecal sources. Both bacteriophages were also present in polluted canals that could receive contamination from other fecal sources or the environment. In conclusion, all three bacteriophages were successfully monitored in Bangkok, Thailand. This study provided an example of bacteriophages for potential use as source identifiers of pathogen contamination. The results from this study will assist in controlling sources of pathogen contamination, especially in developing countries.
TI  - Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae; versatile bacterial pathogens confronting antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Enterobacter aerogenes and E. cloacae have been reported as important opportunistic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. These Gram-negative bacteria have been largely described during several outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in Europe and particularly in France. The dissemination of Enterobacter sp. is associated with the presence of redundant regulatory cascades that efficiently control the membrane permeability ensuring the bacterial protection and the expression of detoxifying enzymes involved in antibiotic degradation/inactivation. In addition, these bacterial species are able to acquire numerous genetic mobile elements that strongly contribute to antibiotic resistance. Moreover, this particular fitness help them to colonize several environments and hosts and rapidly and efficiently adapt their metabolism and physiology to external conditions and environmental stresses. Enterobacter is a versatile bacterium able to promptly respond to the antibiotic treatment in the colonized patient. The balance of the prevalence, E. aerogenes versus E. cloacae, in the reported hospital infections during the last period, questions about the horizontal transmission of mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., the efficacy of the exchange of resistance genes Klebsiella pneumoniae to Enterobacter sp. It is also important to mention the possible role of antibiotic use in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in this E. aerogenes/E. cloacae evolution.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a University hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in State University of Campinas, no data has been published yet. METHODS: The main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. The blood culture records requested from 4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The samples were processed using the Bact/Alert(R) system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). There were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). The prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (15.87%), Escherichia coli (13.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), Enterobacter sp (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and Candida sp (5.1%). Examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 80% of the CNS isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For A. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for P. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When all Gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. For empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.
TI  - Unusual association of NDM-1 with KPC-2 and armA among Brazilian Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  - We report the microbiological characterization of four New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (blaNDM-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. blaNDM-1 was located on a conjugative plasmid and was associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (blaKPC-2) or aminoglycoside-resistance methylase (armA), a 16S rRNA methylase not previously reported in Brazil, in two distinct strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Our results suggested that the introduction of blaNDM-1 in Brazil has been accompanied by rapid spread, since our isolates showed no genetic relationship.
TI  - Biomineralization and formulation of endosulfan degrading bacterial and fungal consortiums.
AB  - Microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove toxicants and in this study, a microbial consortium consisting of bacterial strains and fungal strains were originally obtained from endosulfan contaminated agricultural soils. Identification of the bacterial isolates by 16S rRNA sequences revealed the isolates to be Halophilic bacterium JAS4, Klebsiella pneumoniae JAS8, Enterobacter asburiae JAS5, and Enterobacter cloacae JAS7, whereas the fungal isolates were identified by 18S rRNA sequences and the isolates were Botryosphaeria laricina JAS6, Aspergillus tamarii JAS9 and Lasiodiplodia sp. JAS12. The biodegradation of endosulfan was monitored by using HPLC and FTIR analysis. The bacterial and fungal consortium could degrade 1000 mg l(-1) of endosulfan efficiently in aqueous medium and in soil. The infrared spectrum of endosulfan degraded samples in the aqueous medium by bacterial and fungal consortium showed bands at 1400 and 950 cm(-1) which are the characteristics of COOH group and acid dimer band respectively. In the present investigation, low cost solid materials such as sawdust, soil, fly ash, molasses and nutrients were used for the formulation of microbial consortium and to achieve greater multiplication and survival of the microbial strains.
TI  - Effects of Ensiling Fermentation and Aerobic Deterioration on the Bacterial Community in Italian Ryegrass, Guinea Grass, and Whole-crop Maize Silages Stored at High Moisture Content.
AB  - The effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in Italian ryegrass (IR), guinea grass (GG), and whole-crop maize (WM) silages. Direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-Butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the IR, GG, and WM silages, respectively. The acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of GG ensiling. Pantoea agglomerans, Rahnella aquatilis, and Enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the IR silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri and Bacillus pumilus were detected when IR silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community at silo opening. Lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the GG silage. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. Enterobacter cloacae appeared when the GG silage was spoiled. In the WM silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. Throughout the ensiling, Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella confusa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. lactis. Upon deterioration, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Bacillus gibsonii were detected. These results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling and aerobic spoilage of IR, GG, and WM silages.
TI  - Study of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus strains as probiotics on multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (UTIs).
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by bacteria is one of the most frequent infections in human population. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, often leads to appearance of drug resistance in bacteria. However, use of probiotic bacteria has been suggested as a partial replacement. This study was aimed to assess the antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus standard strains against bacteria isolated from UTI infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 600 samples; those with >/=10,000 cfu/ml were selected as UTI positive samples. Enterococcus sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli were found the most prevalent UTI causative agents. All isolates were screened for multi drug resistance and subjected to the antimicrobial effects of three Lactobacillus strains by using microplate technique and the MICs amounts were determined. In order to verify the origin of antibiotic resistance of isolates, plasmid curing using ethidium bromide and acridine orange was carried out. RESULTS: No antagonistic activity in Lactobacilli suspension was detected against test on Enterococcus and Enterobacter strains and K. pneumoniae, which were resistant to most antibiotics. However, an inhibitory effect was observed for E. coli which were resistant to 8-9 antibiotics. In addition, L. casei was determined to be the most effective probiotic. RESULTS from replica plating suggested one of the plasmids could be related to the gene responsible for ampicillin resistance. CONCLUSION: Treatment of E. coli with probiotic suspension was not effective on inhibition of the plasmid carrying hypothetical ampicillin resistant gene. Moreover, the plasmid profiles obtained from probiotic-treated isolates were identical to untreated isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against Gram-negative organisms collected from U.S. medical centers in 2012.
AB  - The activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli. Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits Ambler class A, C, and some D enzymes. A total of 10,928 Gram-negative bacilli-8,640 Enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 Acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 U.S. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA, USA). Ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. Overall, 99.8% of Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC>/=2 mug/ml) K. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae. Among ESBL-phenotype K. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=8 mug/ml, and susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. Ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa (MIC50/MIC90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). Acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam MIC50/MIC90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. In summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated potent activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in U.S. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of arsenic resistant bacteria from wastewater.
AB  - The present study proposed the isolation of arsenic resistant bacteria from wastewater. Only three bacterial isolates (MNZ1, MNZ4 and MNZ6) were able to grow in high concentrations of arsenic. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of arsenic against MNZ1, MNZ4 and MNZ6 were 300 mg/L, 300 mg/L and 370 mg/L respectively. The isolated strains showed maximum growth at 37 degrees C and at 7.0 pH in control but in arsenite stress Luria Bertani broth the bacterial growth is lower than control. All strains were arsenite oxidizing. All strains were biochemically characterized and ribotyping (16S rRNA) was done for the purpose of identification which confirmed that MNZ1 was homologous to Enterobacter sp. while MNZ4 and MNZ6 showed their maximum homology with Klebsiella pneumoniae. The protein profiling of these strains showed in arsenic stressed and non stressed conditions, so no bands of induced proteins appeared in stressed conditions. The bacterial isolates can be exploited for bioremediation of arsenic containing wastes, since they seem to have the potential to oxidize the arsenite (more toxic) into arsenate (less toxic) form.
TI  - [Diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (BF) on the surface of the implanted material. The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. METHOD: Thirty-five ETTs were obtained from 26 neonates on mechanical ventilator (from October 2012 to March 2013) in Department of Neonatology of Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. DGGE profiling of 16S rDNA gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. TA Cloning Kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF. RESULT: The mean bands of 35 ETTs cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and the mean Shanon-Wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. The 16 ETTs were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. The indwelling days of 6/7 patients' ETTs increased, the Shanon-siener indexes were decreased. Among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different Shanon-siener indexes. The result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained Klebsiella SP., 28 cases (80%) had Pseudomonas SP., 27 cases (77%) had Streptococcus SP., and 32 cases (91%) had Uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) Klebsiella SP. and 22/27(82%) Streptococcus SP. were accompanied by Pseudomonas SP.. There were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. Eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the ETTs on which Klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbiota in BF on ETT was confirmed. 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of BF.
TI  - Emergence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in Andaman Islands, India.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of India. Patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. Significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes Escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); Klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); Enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and Proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). The uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different resistance patterns. Among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% CI 62.13-100.37%) and 11 (68.8%, 95% CI 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. Multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A total of 7 (44%, 95% CI 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants The present study reports for the first time the presence of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene in two isolates of P. mirabilis in these islands. Detection of multidrug resistant and NDM-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. The study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote Islands.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Cytotoxic (A549) and antimicrobial effects of Methylobacterium sp. isolate (ERI-135) from Nilgiris forest soil, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Methylobacterium  sp. isolated from soil sample of Doddabetta forest, Nilgiris, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Isolation of Methylobacterium was performed from soils by serial dilution plate technique. The strain was grown in modified nutrient gulucose agar (MNGA) medium to study the morphology and biochemical characteristics. Methylobacterium sp. was screened for its antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The strain was subjected to 16S rRNA analysis and was identified as Methylobacterium sp. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate exhibited close similarity with other Methylobacterium sp. and has been submitted to Genbank. The antibacterial substances were extracted using chloroform and ethyl acetate from MNGA medium in which ERI-135 had grown for 5 d at 30 degrees C. Cytotoxic effect was also studied. GC-MS analysis was carried out. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro dilution technique. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate extract showed activity against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureu and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and fungi such as, Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were: 250 microg/mL against S. epidermidis and 250microg/mL against K. pneumonia. The isolate had the ability to produce enzymes such as protease. The exyract showed cytotoxic effect in human adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of isovaleric acid (3.64%), 2-Methylbutanoic acid (5.03%), isobutyramide (5.05%), N,N-oimethylformamide-di-t-butylacetal (9.79%), benzeneacetamide (15.56%), octyl butyl phthalate (3.59%) and diisooctyl phthalate (5.79) in the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Methylobacterium sp. (ERI-135) showed promising antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. This is the first report in the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Methylobacterium sp.
TI  - Comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: India.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. Reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. A very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. Daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. RESULTS: The highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by DesNet (5.05) and Bacillocid special (5.02). A comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for Lysol, Bacillocid sp. and DesNet, respectively. In the discard jars, Bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, DesNet for 3 days and Hi-giene Germitol for 1 day. The remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on Day 1. Phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like DesNet and Bacillocid special. CONCLUSIONS: Newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - In vivo-validated essential genes identified in Acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  - A critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. For bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media. This study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. Mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. A subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. The putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, DNA/RNA synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. These A. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other Gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the Database of Essential Genes (DEG), including those of Acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. However, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. None of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of FDA-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. IMPORTANCE: The human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. This scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective against antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli. This study identified a set of A. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. Furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the Database of Essential Genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. Lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria has been identified.
TI  - Characterization of RarA, a novel AraC family multidrug resistance regulator in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Transcriptional regulators, such as SoxS, RamA, MarA, and Rob, which upregulate the AcrAB efflux pump, have been shown to be associated with multidrug resistance in clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria. In addition to the multidrug resistance phenotype, these regulators have also been shown to play a role in the cellular metabolism and possibly the virulence potential of microbial cells. As such, the increased expression of these proteins is likely to cause pleiotropic phenotypes. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major nosocomial pathogen which can express the SoxS, MarA, Rob, and RamA proteins, and the accompanying paper shows that the increased transcription of ramA is associated with tigecycline resistance (M. Veleba and T. Schneiders, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 56:4466-4467, 2012). Bioinformatic analyses of the available Klebsiella genome sequences show that an additional AraC-type regulator is encoded chromosomally. In this work, we characterize this novel AraC-type regulator, hereby called RarA (Regulator of antibiotic resistance A), which is encoded in K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp. 638, Serratia proteamaculans 568, and Enterobacter cloacae. We show that the overexpression of rarA results in a multidrug resistance phenotype which requires a functional AcrAB efflux pump but is independent of the other AraC regulators. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments show that rarA (MGH 78578 KPN_02968) and its neighboring efflux pump operon oqxAB (KPN_02969_02970) are consistently upregulated in clinical isolates collected from various geographical locations (Chile, Turkey, and Germany). Our results suggest that rarA overexpression upregulates the oqxAB efflux pump. Additionally, it appears that oqxR, encoding a GntR-type regulator adjacent to the oqxAB operon, is able to downregulate the expression of the oqxAB efflux pump, where OqxR complementation resulted in reductions to olaquindox MICs.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in Greece.
AB  - The reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. We retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of Enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. Susceptibility testing was done with the automated Vitek 2 system. The breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics were those proposed by the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM), the FDA, and the CLSI, respectively. A total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) Escherichia coli, 1,040 (16.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) Proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) Enterobacter sp. isolates. Excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 K. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). Regarding resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. Isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae species. It could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.
TI  - Temporal variation of microbiological and chemical quality of noncarbonated bottled drinking water sold in Sri Lanka.
AB  - Use of bottled water in Sri Lanka has increased over the last decade, while new brands of bottled water are often introduced to the market. However, the manufacturers' adherence to bottled water regulations is questionable, raising concerns regarding the quality of bottled water. The objective of the current study was to investigate the microbiological and chemical quality of bottled water in Sri Lanka. Thirty bottled water brands were sampled and their chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed. Microbiological analysis was carried out within 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 mo after the date of manufacture. The results indicated that 63% of brands tested exceeded the levels permitted by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) for presumptive total coliforms (TC) (<10 cfu per 100 mL) whereas 97% brands exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) permitted level. Thirty percent of brands exceeded the limit for presumptive fecal coliforms (FC) (0 cfu per 100 mL in accordance with WHO permitted levels, SLSI and the Sri Lanka Health Ministry requirement). Eighty percent of brands showed higher heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) which exceeded the WHO guidelines for bottled drinking water. Throughout their shelf life, the counts of TC, FC, and HPC bacteria decreased. Bacteria identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pasteurella haemolytica, the most frequently being P. aeruginosa. The dominant fungi identified were Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp. Inorganic chemical parameters were within permitted levels for all brands except for initial content of ammonia. The results of this study show the need for the bottling industry to be monitored closely by relevant authorities, in order to provide safe bottled drinking water to consumers in Sri Lanka.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiont marine Enterobacter sp at Kavaratti Island, Lakshadweep archipelago.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiotic bacteria from marine sponges at Lakshadweep archipelago. Also to identify the potent bacteria by 16s rDNA sequencing and determine the antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens by MIC. METHODS: Sponge samples was collected from sub-tidal habitats at Kavaratti Island and identified. The endosymbiotic bacteria were isolated and selected potential bacteria which show antibacterial activity in preliminary screening against clinical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), Klebsiella pneumoniea (K. pneumoniea) and Streptococcus sp. by disc diffusion assay. The crude extracts of potential bacteria LB3 was tested against clinical pathogens by MIC. The LB3 strain was identified by 16s rDNA sequencing, 1 111 bp was submitted in NCBI (HQ589912) and constructed phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Sponge sample was identified as Dysidea granulosa (D. granulosa) and potential bacteria LB3 identified as Enterobacter sp TTAG. Preliminary screening of sponge isolates against clinical pathogens, LB3 strain was selected as potential producer of secondary metabolites and crude extract was implies on MIC of LB3 have confirmed with lowest concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in broth medium influence of crude extract on growth inhibitory activity after 5 h of incubation period and completed the inhibitory activity at 15 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  - The presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in Mexico. Results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. Susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (Cr(R)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (Hg(R)). Cr(R) levels were high in Klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in Enterobacter cloacae (12%) and Escherichia coli (4%), and null in Salmonella sp. isolates. Colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chrA gene (87% of Cr(R) isolates), encoding a CHR transporter homologue, and merA gene (74% of Hg(R) isolates), encoding MerA mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. Southern blot hybridization of Cr(R) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from K. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an E. cloacae isolate, contained chrA-related sequences. These plasmids belonged to IncN or IncP incompatibility groups, and conferred Cr(R), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an E. coli standard strain. These data indicated that Cr(R) genes may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.
TI  - Rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL-PE) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - The antimicrobial activities of processed Nigerian and South African black tea.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of processed Nigerian Lipton Tea and South African 5 Roses Tea, extracted using distilled water, chloroform and 70% ethanol were determined against nine (9) enteropathogenic bacteria which includes; Bacillus subtilis, Proteus sp, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella arizona and Staphylococcus aureus. The 2 tea bags, Nigerian Lipton tea bag and the South African 5 Roses tea bag were extracted through Solvent extraction method using 3 extraction solvents; Distilled water, Chloroform and 70% Ethanol and then inoculated onto the Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing the standard isolates at 6 different points on each plate. The zones of inhibition of the bacterial isolates produced by each of these tea - extracts were determined while meaningful antibacterial activities against five (5) of the standard isolates; Enterobacter sp., K. pneumoniae, S. paratyphi A, B. subtilis and S. aureus were observed. Lipton tea water-extract was a more effective antibacterial agent than water-extract of 5 Roses tea. While the 70% ethanol-extract of 5 Roses tea had the greatest antibacterial activity of all the different tea-extract used for the study, the chloroform-extracts of the tea bags had no antimicrobial effect on all the test organisms used.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Control of coliform bacteria detected from diarrhea associated patients by extracts of Moringa oleifera.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the total population of coliform bacteria in the samples collected from diarrhea associated patients from the local area of Bangladesh and to examine the antibacterial efficacy of leaf extracts of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) against the isolated coliform bacteria. The coliform bacteria detected in these samples by some microbial-biochemical tests such as Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. The total isolation rate of coliform bacterial species was ranged from 38.01-3.51%. At the concentration of 300 ig/disc, the organic extracts of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Moringa oleifera leaf exhibited a remarkable antibacterial effect against all the tested bacterial pathogens. The zones of inhibition against all the tested bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 8.0 to 23.2 mm, along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 62.5-1000 ig/mL. The results obtained in this study suggest that the extracts from Moringa oleifera leaf can be a source of natural antimicrobials with potential applications in pharmaceutical industry to control coliform bacteria.
TI  - Biofilm bacterial communities and abundance in a full-scale drinking water distribution system in Shanghai.
AB  - Community diversity and abundance of biofilms from a full-scale drinking water distribution system in Shanghai were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA sequences and heterotrophic plate count (HPC), respectively. Bacteria affiliated to the Beta- and Gamma-Proteobacteria were dominating in both in-situ and HPC-culturable bacterial communities. Other bacteria present included members of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae and Firmicutes. Acidovorax, Ralstonia and Acinetobacter were common species in biofilms. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp. were detected in the local distribution system. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), residual disinfectant and temperature were the most important factors influencing both bacterial abundance and composition. HPC for biofilm sample was not correlated with its community diversity.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of Rose Bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers Rose Bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (LED) on Enterobacteriaceae. Twelve Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three Escherichia coli, three Enterobacter cloacae, three Klebsiella oxytoca and three Klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. An Enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: LED and Rose Bengal, LED and erythrosin, LED and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. A blue LED unit (460 nm), and Rose Bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal. There was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for Enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for Escherichia coli, 6.76 log10 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for Klebsiella oxytoca. However, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of CFUs per milliliter compared to the control group. The use of the LED alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. The Enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying the novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene variants bla(SHV-40), bla(TEM-116) and the class 1 integron-associated bla(GES-7) in Brazil.
AB  - A clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate carrying the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene variants bla(SHV-40), bla(TEM-116) and bla(GES-7) was recovered. Cefoxitin and ceftazidime activity was most affected by the presence of these genes and an additional resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was observed. The bla(GES-7) gene was found to be inserted into a class 1 integron. These results show the emergence of novel bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) genes in Brazil. Moreover, the presence of class 1 integrons suggests a great potential for dissemination of bla(GES) genes into diverse nosocomial pathogens. Indeed, the bla(GES-7) gene was originally discovered in Enterobacter cloacae in Greece and, to our knowledge, has not been reported elsewhere.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, and Hera Hospital in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2005 to March 2006. A total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. Demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. RESULTS: The most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Klebsiella sp. (6.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), Proteus sp. (3.3%), and Enterobacter sp. (1.9%). Results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. The implementation of monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 in fermented crop straw. METHODS: Total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. All these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of SFC-2. RESULTS: (1) Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacterfreundii, Klebsiella terrigena and Citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) Indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of SFC-2 cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that: SFC-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from SFC-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) Antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from the culture of SFC-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease K.
TI  - A dormancy state in nonspore-forming bacteria.
AB  - While cultivation is a convenient way of proliferating and understanding bacteria, studies have shown the formation of nonculturable cells in nonspore-forming bacteria in response to environmental stress and thus in turn have generated immense interest. Whether these cells are in a state of dormancy or in a stage preceding cell death has been considered of paramount importance for the past couple of decades. In this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and revived by osmotic down-shift in the absence of nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation factor(s). Reversal of dormancy followed a definite pattern akin to population asynchrony of dormant cells, and the phenomenon was observed across three species, namely, Enterobacter sp. strain mcp11b, Klebsiella pneumonia strain mcp11d and Escherichia coli. In addition, our study precisely forecasted the presence of multiple subpopulations in dormant cells, which is explained by an emerging theory of survival mechanisms in stressful environments. These observations reveal that the state of dormancy induced by environmental stress in these nonspore-forming bacteria is "reversible" and also implies that it is an orderly and spontaneous adaptation to circumvent adverse conditions.
TI  - Type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pOLA52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in Enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pOLA52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Screening of a transposon-mutagenized pOLA52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkABCDF operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pOLA52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. The conjugative transfer rate of pOLA52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. Through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be expressed as a single operon. Immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (MrkA)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. When transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, pOLA52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pOLA52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3 fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of the plasmid-harbouring strain.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Substrate specificity of the OqxAB multidrug resistance pump in Escherichia coli  and selected enteric bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, OqxAB, identified in Escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. The ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. METHODS: The MICs of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic E. coli strains, except for the presence of the oqxAB operon. A derivative of the plasmid encoding OqxAB (pOLA52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to Salmonella Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. The effect of the presence of the OqxAB pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. RESULTS: The OqxAB pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in E. coli. These included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pOLA52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. Transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. CONCLUSIONS: The plasmid-encoded OqxAB pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between Enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. These results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.
TI  - Ertapenem resistance among Klebsiella and Enterobacter submitted in the UK to a reference laboratory.
AB  - The emergence of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae represents a major public health concern. We investigated ertapenem-resistant clinical isolates of Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. referred to the UK's national reference laboratory for antibiotic resistance. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and interpreted according to British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy guidelines. Genes for carbapenemases and CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were sought by polymerase chain reaction, and imipenem hydrolysis was determined by spectrophotometry with crude extracts. From June 2004 to April 2006, 95 Klebsiella spp. and 76 Enterobacter spp. isolates resistant to ertapenem (MICs >2mg/L) were received, 40% of which (38 Klebsiella spp. and 30 Enterobacter spp.) were highly resistant to ertapenem (MICs >16mg/L). Imipenem and meropenem were active (geometric mean MICs <2mg/L) against most isolates with low-level ertapenem resistance but were less active against highly ertapenem-resistant isolates. Only one ertapenem-resistant isolate produced a defined carbapenemase, a Klebsiella pneumoniae with IMP-1 enzyme; one Enterobacter sp. also hydrolysed imipenem, but its carbapenemase remains to be identified. Geometric mean MICs of ertapenem for the collection were reduced five-fold by clavulanic acid for Klebsiella spp. compared with eight-fold by cloxacillin for Enterobacter spp. This study highlights the fact that ertapenem resistance is being detected in Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. in the UK, but that it is rarely mediated by true carbapenemases. Rather, it probably results from combinations of a beta-lactamase - often a CTX-M ESBL in Klebsiella spp. or an AmpC enzyme in Enterobacter spp. - plus impermeability and/or increased efflux. Imipenem and meropenem often remain moderately active against isolates with low-level ertapenem resistance.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - qnr prevalence in ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from the United States.
AB  - We screened 313 ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained in the United States from 1999 to 2004 for all three known qnr genes. A qnr gene was present in 20% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 31% of Enterobacter sp. isolates, and 4% of Escherichia coli isolates. qnrA and qnrB occurred with equivalent frequencies and, except for qnrB in enterobacters, were stable over time. qnrS was absent.
TI  - Airsacculitis in fourteen juvenile southern Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airsacculitis is a clinical condition which has been reported in a range of primates species, including orangutans. METHODS: This report describes the occurence and management of airsacculitis in fourteen juvenile Southern Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) that presented beween January 1st 1999 and January 31st 2001 at the Orangutan Care Center and Quarantine (OCC&Q), Kalimantan Tengah, Indonesia (S 2 degrees 43' 49.2"; E 111 degrees 38' 54.2"). Details of the signalment, clinical history, presenting clinical signs, clinicopathological findings and bacterial isolates in each case were reviewed. RESULTS: Cough, halitosis and nasal discharge were the most frequently observed clinical signs. A range of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from infected air sacs, including Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter sp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A simple drainage and lavage technique was used in cases where surgical intervention was indicated, in combination with local and systemic antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of early diagnosis, prompt management and antibiotic selection, based on bacterial culture and sensitivity profiles, is outlined.
TI  - Confirmation of E. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  - Paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. Some are rich in wood fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. Others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. Still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their coliform microflora. Therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. For the first series of analyses, the medium used was Colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to isolate bacteria in pure culture on MacConkey agar. In a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase activities, were used to isolate bacteria. First, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. Also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 MPN/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. From this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on MacConkey medium and identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter sp, E. sakazakii, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Pantoea sp, Raoultella terrigena, R. planticola. Second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 MPN/g (d.w) sludge, whereas E. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 MPN/g (d.w.) sludge. The presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in large quantities. Also, indigenous E. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated E. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. In this second series of isolations, API20E and Biolog identified most isolates as E. coli, but others remained unidentified. The sequences of the 16S rDNA confirmed that most isolates were likely E. coli, few Burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. This study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cockroaches (Diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. Their involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in Africa. METHODS: A study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in Ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serretia marcescens, S. aureus, S. feacalis, S. epidermidis, Aeromonas sp, Candida sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus sp, Mucor sp, cysts of E. hystolitica, oocysts of C. parvum, C. cayetenensis and Isospora belli, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, Anchylostoma deodunalae, Enterobius vermicularis, ova Trichuris trichura, larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. Cockroaches trapped in the toilets of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. A bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines. On the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - [Profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia].
AB  - The profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 Klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola, K. mobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marscescens, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. The utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: Klebsiella (profiles No. 1--6, 9, 10), Enterobacter (No. 11--13), Serratia (No. 14--16), Escherichia (No. 17). The full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of K. mobilis (No. 1, 6) and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia was established, which confirmed that K. mobilis (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - Distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  - Bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, B, C, and D, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. There are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene B (homology to ubiX) and C (ubiD) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene D, are not numerous ( approximately 15). The occurrence of the entire BCD gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement CDB), Streptomyces sp. D7, Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica, S. paratyphi, S. typhimurium, S. bongori, and S. diarizonae. The corresponding genes from S. hydroxybenzoicus, B. subtilis, Streptomyces sp. D7, E. coli O157:H7, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in E. coli DH5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.
TI  - Microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in Jordan.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing Tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in Jordan. Twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in Amman, Jordan. Water is the major component of the drinks. Sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline pH (range, 6.6 to 9.9; mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic pH (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). The drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. The mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log CFU/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log CFU/ml, respectively. The lactic acid bacteria isolated were Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus buchneri. The yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera Candida, Filobasidium, Hanseniaspora, Lodderomyces, Pichia, and Williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from Arthroascus, Brettanomyces, Candida, Debaromyces, Filobasidiella, Hanseniaspora, Klavispora, Lodderomyces, Pichia, Saccharomycodes, Trichosporon, and Zygosaccharomyces. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as Enterobacter sakazakii and Erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. These findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.
TI  - [Distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou. METHODS: From July 2001 to August 2003, the resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard Kirby-Bauer method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2000). WHONET-5 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were Escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). The total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). The prevalences of ESBLs-producing strains in the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Proteus SP. in Guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. According to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by Cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). Imipenem was the most effective agents against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., and Proteus SP. isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-ESBLs-producing strains (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in Guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. An unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. Imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in Guangzhou.
TI  - [Development and evaluation of a PCR method for diagnosis of Salmonella enteric fever, based on DNA sequences of the hilA gene].
AB  - Typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to Salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. Salmonella spp. uses the hilA gene (component of the pathogenicity island I) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. Using the hilA gene sequence a PCR test was designed to detect Salmonella in blood samples. The sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. Presence of S. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. Blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-Salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 4). Control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV for the PCR method were all 100%. The lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by PCR in blood samples was 10.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. Five University Clinics and/or Regional Hospitals in the Slovak Republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (13.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter sp. All CONS and S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the CONS and only for 4% of S. aureus isolates. A higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in CONS in comparison to S. aureus. Enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against E. coli. Although 17% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against K. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Validation of a PCR for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hilA gene in clinical samples from Colombian patients.
AB  - Validation of a PCR test to detect hilA gene sequences of Salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. Sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and Enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy volunteers. To evaluate S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due Salmonella spp. (S. Typhimurium, 21; S. Enteritidis, 9; S. Choleraesuis, 3 and S. Agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to Shigella sonnei (8), Shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic E. coli (12), Aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in blood samples were all 100 %. PCR detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. In faeces samples, S was 97 %, SP 100 %, PPV 100 % and NPV 99 %. The lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by PCR in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - [Vascular prosthesis infection in thoracic aorta surgery: review of the experience and a case report illustrating treatment with an unconventional technique].
AB  - We report the case of a 37-year-old-female patient who had undergone a Bentall procedure at our service and returned with intense chest pain and acute aortic dissection type III, which was diagnosed and clinically treated. One year after this episode, this dissection expanded, and the patient underwent surgery with interposition of a Dacron graft in the descending aorta. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient experienced left bronchopneumonia and was discharged afebrile and in good condition. One month after discharge, she returned with fever and toxemia. Pleural empyema was diagnosed, and she underwent an exploratory thoracotomy that did not confirm this diagnosis, but revealed intense effusion thickening. Four months after the exploratory thoracotomy, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp were isolated in a blood culture. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed shapes compatible with perigraft infection. With this clinical and laboratory picture, graft removal was indicated as was axillo-bifemoral grafting. Surgery was successfully performed, the patient was discharged in good condition, and remains well after a 57-month follow-up without complications. The methods used for diagnosis and treatment of prosthesis infection in thoracic aorta surgery are discussed.
TI  - Sepsis in burned patients.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted from June 2001 to May 2002 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil. During the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the Burns Unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and microbiologically proven sepsis. Twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). Forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. These 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. Forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. Thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. Out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to Candida sp. The most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were Staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. The primary foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. The most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. The most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. Twelve (24.5%) patients died. The appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
TI  - Microbiological contamination of enteral feeding solutions used in Costa Rican hospitals.
AB  - Enteral feeding is the most common and preferred modality for providing nutritional support to hospital patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract that can not satisfy their nutritional requirements. Nevertheless, enteral feeding may be an important cause of bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial contamination level of enteral feedings distributed in Costa Rican hospitals. A total of 124 samples of enteral feeding, coming from five different hospitals from San Jose, Costa Rica, were evaluated during the second semester of 1997 and first of 1998 for the presence and identification of total and fecal coliforms, Pseudomonas sp. and Listeria sp. A subpopulation of the Pseudomonas isolated was analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The concentration of Gram negative rods in the samples of enteral feeding solutions ranged from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/mL, markedly exceeding the permissible level (10(2) CFU/mL or less). The coliforms most frequently isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coil, Serratia sp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated in more than 70% of the samples made from commercial based solutions, fruits and vegetables. P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens were the species most frequently isolated. Listeria sp. was not isolated from enteral solutions samples. The results obtained demonstrate that it is urgent to assure strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feed in order to avoid bacterial growth. The implementation of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) system will be required in a near future for better quality control of enteral nutrition mixtures.
TI  - [Sepsis in childhood: epidemiological profile and microbiologic diagnosis]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish an etiological and epidemiological profile of sepsis among children that were hospitalized in the Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin - HIAS (a reference public hospital for all pediatric diseases in the state of Ceara), since this disease has been of high prevalence in this hospital with considerable mortality. METHODS: All children admitted in the hospital from January 1993 to June 1994, who presented sepsis or developed nosocomial sepsis and presented positive blood cultures were studied prospectively. The epidemiologic study was conducted by gathering information in questionnaire form about the following factors: sex, age, reference area, nutritional status, complaints at admission, sepsis origin (nosocomial or not), and outcome for each case. Microbiologic analysis were formed by means of blood culture, concomitant with sensitivity tests of the isolated bacteria to the most commonly used antibiotics. All samples were processed at the Laboratory of Microbiology of the Health's Science Center of the Federal University in Ceara. RESULTS: 205 children were studied of which 17 presented two septic episodes, making a total of 222 episodes in the period. 56.1% of them were male, 81.4% were less than one-year old, 71.1% were malnourished children and 60.5% came from the countryside of the Ceara State. At the moment of their admission, two-thirds of the children presented gastrointestinal problems (diarrhea) or respiratory complaints, whereas 47.7% of the episodes of sepsis were acquired in hospital. The mortality rate was 56.1%. Blood culture test showed a predominance of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (24.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.2%), Enterobacter sp (11.2%), Escherichia coli (7%), and others (19.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological profile of the population in this study was the following: these children were less than one-year old, the majority of them were malnourished and when they were hospitalized, presented with symptoms of diarrhea or respiratory disease. 40% of them had a disease or situation that favored the development of sepsis. The predominant bacterias were Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. It is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals. In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of AHL-producing and AHL-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. We showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter agglomerans, produced AHL signals. We also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., Agrobacterium tumefaciens XJ01, Bacillus cereus XJ08, and Ralstonia sp. XJ12, expressed AHL degradation enzymes. Furthermore, we showed that P. aeruginosa isolate HL43 was virulent against animal model Caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than P. aeruginosa strains PA01 and PA14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. These data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.
TI  - Surfactant proteins A and D inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria by increasing membrane permeability.
AB  - The pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. In this study, we examined the effect of SP-A and SP-D on the growth and viability of Gram-negative bacteria. The pulmonary clearance of Escherichia coli K12 was reduced in SP-A-null mice and was increased in SP-D-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. Purified SP-A and SP-D inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In general, rough E. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough LPS vesicles. Although both SP-A and SP-D agglutinated E. coli K12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. At least part of the antimicrobial activity of SP-A and SP-D was localized to their C-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. Incubation of E. coli K12 with SP-A or SP-D increased bacterial permeability. Deletion of the E. coli OmpA gene from a collectin-resistant smooth E. coli strain enhanced SP-A and SP-D-mediated growth inhibition. These data indicate that SP-A and SP-D are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in an intensive care unit in a private hospital.
AB  - The nosocomial infection rate in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital was assessed during an 18-month survey. From 629 admissions to the ICU, 139 hospital-acquired infections were identified. The rate was 22.1% compared to the overall nosocomial infection rate of 15.3% for the entire hospital. In the ICU, the main infections occurred in the respiratory tract, 41 (29.5%), followed by surgical wounds, 35 (25.2%), urinary tract, 28 (20.1%) and the blood stream, 24 (17.3%). From 165 bacterial isolates, 80% of isolates were gram-negative rods, with P aeruginosa, 48 (36.6%), being the predominant gram-negative isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27 (20.6%), and Enterobacter sp, 22 (16.8%). The main gram-positive isolates were S aureus, 23 (41.8%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 17 (30.9%), and Enterococci, 11 (20.0%). Of the 23 S aureus strains, 15 (65.2%) were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), (8 MRSA were from surgical wounds, 5 from the respiratory tract and 2 from infected urine). Only 2 of the 17 (11.8%) coagulase-negative staphylococci were methicillin-resistant, and both were isolated from wounds. Resistance to ampicillin and augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) was high, 81.9% and 55.4%, respectively. Gentamicin, aztreonam, piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam showed resistance rates of less than 15%. Infection control measures aimed at reducing nosocomial infections at the hospital are often frustrated by apathy of hospital administrators who apparently are insensitive to the high nosocomial infection rate. Effort by the infection control team through seminars, lectures and newsletters have begun to show improvements in attitude and awareness of staff to infection control and preventative measures within the institution.
TI  - Multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  - Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of death in ICUs, especially affecting septic patients. It is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. The prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. The objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital ICU related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of MOF, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. The mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. The main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. A retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the ICU in a 4 month period during 1999. Fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by ACCS/SCCM criteria. There were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency patients). APACHE II score was calculated on admission and MOF, measured for the first five days, was diagnosed using Marshall and Meakins criteria. The statistical method used was non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). Thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. Death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). None of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%), died. There were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. The most frequent bacteria found were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (2). The mean value +/- SD of APACHE II (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). We conclude that MOF due to sepsis in an ICU is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high APACHE II.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: MYSTIC Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - [Participation of multiresistant gram-negative rods in systemic infections of newborns treated in the Neonatal Clinics of the University Hospital in Krakow in 1993-1997].
AB  - Results of blood cultures in 1187 newborns hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, University Hospital in Krakow in furing the last five years were analysed. A trial of monitoring the presence of multi-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae with new mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics as well as analysed of their antibiotics susceptibility patterns were undertaken. Surprisingly high percentage of Gram-negative rods E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae strains resistant to the 3rd generation of cephalosporins and participating in septic complications in the investigated hospital environment was demonstrated. There were identified 53 strains of Enterobacter sp., 35 strains of Klebsiella sp. and 3 strains of E. coli extremely resistant to ceftazidine, accounting for 72%, 56% and 5% of all isolated of the given kind, respectively. Dynamic increase in a number of multiresistant strains of K. pneumoniae from 11.1% of isolates in 1993 to 83% in 1997 was shown as well as remaining on a very high level frequency of isolation of Enterobacter sp. rods capable of producing chromosomal cephalosporinases was demonstrated. Full efficacy of carbapenems and high usefulness of ciprofloxacine in the treatment of infections were confirmed. The authors emphasize necessity for constant monitoring of susceptibility to antibiotics in resistant strains as well as for liquidating their sources and ways of their transmission.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Evaluation of the Petrifilm rapid coliform count plate method for coliform enumeration from surimi-based imitation crab slurry.
AB  - The 3M Petrifilm rapid coliform count (RCC) plate method was compared with two conventional methods, namely violet red bile agar (VRBA) and desoxycholate lactose agar (DLA), for enumerating coliforms. The VRBA plating method is a reference method in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual and the DLA plating method is the method recommended by the Food Sanitation Law of Korea for enumeration of coliforms. Serratia sp., a coliform that was isolated from frozen surimi, was incubated in surimi-based imitation crab (SBIC) slurries and enumerated on the Petrifilm RCC, VRBA, and DLA plates. Results from the Petrifilm RCC plate were not significantly different from results from VRBA or DLA plates at P < 0.05 level. The correlation coefficient for Petrifilm RCC plates versus the VRBA method and for Petrifilm RCC plates versus the DLA method were 0.994 and 0.996, respectively. With the Petrifilm RCC plate method, we were able to estimate presumptive coliforms (except Serratia sp.) after 14 h and to enumerate confirmed coliforms (including Serratia sp.) after 24 h.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in Gizan region, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, Bayadh and Hamra. The bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees C. Two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. The micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. Both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). The content of lactic acid was increased with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). The pH dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third fermentations, respectively. The microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lact. lactis subsp. lactis, Lact. cellobiosus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Kl. pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent. sakazakii, Serratia marcescens and Ser. odourifera), moulds (Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Aspergillus niger, Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp. and Mucor sp.) and yeasts (Candida parapsilosis, C. orvegnsis and Rhodotorula glutinis).
TI  - Cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  - Topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. The anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. The pathogens used were Branhamella catarrhalis, Enterobacter sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. The bacteria studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: Cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. Phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. These topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. Otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical anesthetics when culturing specimens. This is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. Further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. This type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. A modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the United States (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites), and Europe (24 sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY participants (4,119 from the United States and 939 from Canada). In both the United States and Canada, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the United States and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the United States and Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, U.S. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA, and vanB) in the Canadian microbial population. Among U.S. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at Sao Paulo Hospital--UNIFESP/EPM in June and July of 1992. The species distribution was as follows: Enterobacter sp. (62), Escherichia coli (308), Klebsiella pneumoniae (27), Klebsiella sp. (9), Proteus mirabilis (23), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), Pseudomonas sp. (4), Serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives (7). Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. The antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, DU 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, FK 037, imipenem, meropenem and biapenem. RESULTS: DU 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. It was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. The potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae, except for Enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than they were to cefetazidime or FK 037. When testing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active than imipenem or biapenem. In addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. CONCLUSION: The new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. However, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.
TI  - [The effect of cefepime on ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem resistant strains of Acinetobacter, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Sphingobacterium and on producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) with resistance transfer].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position C3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. It is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. We investigated the efficiency of the cefepime (Maxipime, BMS) against Acinetobacter sp., X. maltophilia, Pseudomonas sp., Flavobacterium sp., Sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of ESBL (Extended Spectrum beta-Lactamases) (Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella sp.). METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the susceptibility of the 54 strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. The majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and MIC is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have MIC = 6.25 mg/l. Two strains (one strain P. aeruginosa a one strain K. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and MIC = 12.5 mg/l. The activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of P. cepacia and two strains of Sphingobacterium multivorum. They hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. However, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.
TI  - Adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  - Intestinal colonization by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia (KES) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. We studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 KES clinical isolates: 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 Klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 Enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 Serratia sp. (13%) isolates. Half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. A total of 27 of 30 K. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line Intestine-407 (Int-407), while none of the K. oxytoca or E. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the E. cloacae isolates adhered. Three adhesive patterns were observed for K. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. While most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant K. pneumoniae isolates producing the CAZ-5 beta-lactamase. Furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. The distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative E. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/Dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific DNA probes. No relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. Our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.
TI  - A prospective study of Gram-negative bacteremia in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital- and community-acquired Gram-negative bacteremia is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in pediatric medical centers. Gram-negative organisms are isolated in > 50% of pediatric patients with bacteremia. OBJECTIVES: To analyze clinical and epidemiologic variables associated with Gram-negative bacteremia in a tertiary children's medical center. METHODS: A 6-year prospective study of children with Gram-negative bacteremia in a tertiary care children's medical center in Israel. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four episodes of Gram-negative bacteremia were studied during 6 years. The predominant isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which accounted for 109, 81 and 79 episodes (26, 20 and 19%), respectively. Of all episodes 43% occurred in neonates and infants younger than 2 years and 47% were hospital-acquired. Underlying conditions mainly acute leukemia and lymphoma, were present in 55% of the patients. Urinary tract infection followed by lower respiratory tract infection were the most common identified sources of bacteremia. Central intravenous catheters were associated with 53% of the episodes. The crude mortality was 11.4%. Increased mortality was significantly associated with acute leukemia, neutropenia, hospital-acquired infections and previous corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.03, 0.003, 0.006 and 0.01, respectively). Increased antibiotic resistance of hospital-acquired vs community-acquired isolates was noted; 44 to 77% resistance of nosocomial Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. to second and third generation cephalosporins and 18% were resistant to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae is currently the most common organism causing Gram-negative bacteremia in children. Because of the relatively high resistance of Gram-negative organisms to second and third generation cephalosporins, we suggest that empiric antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia include a combination of an aminoglycoside and an anti-Pseudomonas beta-lactam.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Infections in children with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: an autopsy study of 30 cases in south Florida, 1990-1993.
AB  - Thirty autopsies performed on infants and children with HIV infection and/or AIDS were reviewed for the presence and type of infection. Twenty-six (87%) demonstrated evidence of infection in addition to HIV at the time of postmortem examination. Pathogenic bacterial infectious were the most frequently encountered, seen in 15 of the cases. Nine of the 15 (60%) were due to gram-negative rods, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infections with gram-negative organisms often involved multiple organ systems and were frequently undiagnosed both pre- and postmortem because of variability in culture results and difficulties in identification both clinically and in tissue sections. Discussion is presented of unusual staining characteristics and filamentous morphology found with these pathogens. Other pathogenic bacteria encountered were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., and Staphylococcus. Fungal infections due to Candida species were present in nine cases (31%) but were invasive in only two of these. One instance of Aspergillus meningo-encephalitis was noted. Proven viral infections were present in five children (three cytomegalovirus, one herpes simplex, and one adenovirus). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was diagnosed in five of the patients (17%), and one instance of disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare was encountered.
TI  - Quantification of frankia strains and other root-associated bacteria in pure cultures and in the rhizosphere of axenic seedlings by high-performance liquid chromatography-based muramic Acid assay.
AB  - Application of a high-performance liquid chromatography-based muramic acid assay  with precolumn fluorescence derivatization to quantification of root-associated bacteria was studied both in pure cultures and in the rhizosphere of axenic Festuca rubra seedlings. Quantities of muramic acid from acid-hydrolyzed cells of Frankia strains, Streptomyces griseoviridis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas sp., and Bacillus polymyxa were mostly proportional to the respective cell protein and carbon quantities, but in some strains, culture age and particularly sporulation affected these ratios considerably. The muramic acid/cell protein ratio was generally 2 to 4 times higher in strains of the two actinomycete genera, Frankia and Streptomyces, than in the rest of the strains. Quantification of Frankia strains, S. griseoviridis, E. agglomerans, and Pseudomonas sp. was also attempted from the rhizosphere of F. rubra seedlings which had been inoculated with pure cultured bacteria and incubated briefly. It was possible to quantify Frankia cells by use of the muramic acid assay from both the root and the growth medium, whereas cells of the rest of the bacterial genera could only be detected in the medium. The detection limit for muramic acid was about 10 ng/ml hydrolysis volume, and from the Festuca rhizosphere, 28 to 63% of the muramic acid in the Frankia inoculum was recovered.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.
TI  - Phosphatase-mediated heavy metal accumulation by a Citrobacter sp. and related enterobacteria.
AB  - A Citrobacter sp. was reported previously to accumulate heavy metals as cell-bound heavy metal phosphates. Metal uptake is mediated by the activity of a periplasmic acid-type phosphatase that liberates inorganic phosphate to provide the precipitant ligand for heavy metals presented to the cells. Amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments of the purified enzyme revealed significant homology to the phoN product (acid phosphatase) of some other enterobacteria. These organisms, together with Klebsiella pneumoniae, previously reported to produce acid phosphatase, were tested for their ability to remove uranium and lanthanum from challenge solutions supplemented with phosphatase substrate. The coupling of phosphate liberation to metal bioaccumulation was limited to the metal accumulating Citrobacter sp.; therefore the participation of species-specific additional factors in metal bioaccumulation was suggested.
TI  - The pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  - We examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital during the past 15 years. A total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. The rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). Advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage I: 6.3%, stage II: 15.9%, stage III: 27.9%, and stage IV: 33.8%). Deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. Isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. Our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT 4140, RP 64206--SPFX) against 275 multiresistant clinical isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with that of pefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 275 multiresistant nosocomial clinical isolates. They consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37), Enterobacter cloacae (42), Acinetobacter anitratus (60), Klebsiella pneumoniae (37) and Staphylococcus sp (99). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) and geometric mean MICs for sparfloxacin were as follows (mg/l): P. aeruginosa 128-23.7, E. cloacae 1-0.13, A. anitratus 2-0.14, K. pneumoniae 1-0.08, MRSA 16-0.98, MSSA 0.12-0.03, MRSE 0.25-0.12 and MSSE 0.12-0.05. It is concluded that sparfloxacin was the most potent agent against staphylococci and A. anitratus including strains resistant to the other quinolones while ciprofloxacin was the most potent agent against P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Desiccated rattlesnake capsules: a potential source of gram-negative bacterial infection].
AB  - The ingestion of rattlesnake powder capsules is frequent in Mexico in view of their alleged curative properties in various diseases, among them different malignancies. Based on previous reports showing both bacteremia and septicemia in patients with malignant diseases ingesting such capsules, we conducted a study to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in 16 different preparations of rattlesnake powder capsules, obtained in six different cities of our country. We found that all the samples were significantly contaminated with gram-negative coliform bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Salmonella arizona and Salmonella of groups B, E4 and G. Eighty one percent of the capsules were contaminated with Salmonella sp. The most frequent was S. arizona with a natural reservoir in snakes. Contamination was probably derived from both the flesh of the snake and fecal contamination during the domestic preparation of the powder to produce the capsules. These data, together with those previously published regarding bacteremia and septicemia derived from the ingestion of the capsules, suggests that there is danger in their use.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of microorganisms associated with the traditional  sorghum fermentation for production of sudanese kisra.
AB  - Sorghum flour obtained from Sudan was mixed with water in a 1:2 (wt/vol) ratio and fermented at 30 degrees C for 24 h. The bacterial populations increased with fermentation time and reached a plateau at approximately 18 h. At the end of 24 h, sorghum batter pH had dropped from 5.95 to 3.95 and the batter had a lactic acid content of 0.80%. The microbial population during the 24 h of fermentation consisted of bacteria (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus confusus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus sp., Erwinia ananas, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae), yeasts (Candida intermedia and Debaryomyces hansenii), and molds (Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., and Rhizopus sp.). P. pentosaceus was the dominant microorganism at the end of the 24-h fermentation. When three consecutive fermentations using an inoculum from the previous fermentation were carried out, the bacterial population increase plateaued at 9 h. The microbial populations in these fermentations were dominated by P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Aminoglycosides versus beta-lactams in gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  - Newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. There is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, Enterobacter sp, and Acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. At this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. Thus, combination therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.

AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (RU 51807) is an enterally absorbed ester prodrug which is rapidly cleaved in vivo after oral administration, with release of the active free acid metabolite cefpodoxime. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (RU 51746) against approximately 800 clinical isolates was evaluated comparatively with other orally active beta-lactams. RU 51746 was found to be active against enterobacteria normally susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, with MIC50 values ranging from 0.02 mg/l (Providencia sp) to 5 mg/l (C. freundii). RU 51746 was also active against H. influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains (MIC50 0.04 mg/l), oxa-S S. aureus (2,5), beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.05) and S. pneumoniae (0.002). Oxa-R staphylococci and P. aeruginosa were resistant to RU 51746 (MIC50 greater than 40 mg/l for both organisms). The antibacterial activity of RU 51746 was bactericidal in nature and independent from test conditions. The molecule was stable to all the beta-lactamases studied, with the exception of cefuroximase (type Ic). RU 51746 exhibited no strong inhibitory effects on these enzymes, except with Enterobacter P99 (type Ia). A good correlation was found between in vivo activity of RU 51807 and in vitro activity of RU 51746. Cefpodoxime proxetil was found to be more effective than cefaclor in mice with experimental septicemia caused by various streptococci, with a DP50 ratio in the 10-100 range. This advantage was again evidenced for septicemias due to various enterobacteria. In contrast, cefaclor proved more effective in experimental staphylococcus infections. In mice with experimental pneumonia, cefpodoxime proxetil caused sharp falls in K. pneumoniae lung counts. Six days after induction of the infection, 60% of animals under cefpodoxime proxetil had sterile lungs, versus 25% of animals under amoxicillin.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis: observations on its etiology, mortality and sequelae].
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out on all cases diagnosed with neonatal meningitis at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez. A rate of 9.6 cases per 1,000 discharged patients was found as well as 6.7% association with sepsis. In 50 of the cases analyzed, an etiologic agent was identified in 23 children; the main bacteria identified were Escherichia coli (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterobacter (4%), Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas sp (2%), respectively. The mortality rate was 60% and sequelae were seen in 13 of the surviving 20 patients. The unfavorable prognosis of neonates with meningitis forces us to establish an early diagnosis, make every effort to identify the causing agent and try new medications as well as co-adjuvant treatments.
TI  - Use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  - Despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. Thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. We have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. Of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Enterobacter sp (1). Seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees C), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/L [greater than 18,000 cells/microL]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (Enterobacter [3], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and Staphylococcus [2]). Two other donors with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. Early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of Pseudomonas septicemia. Late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. Only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. Use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group of recipients. This practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - [Sensitivity to cefoperazone (CEFOBID) of microorganisms isolated from diagnostic specimens].
AB  - Sensitivity of cephaperasone (CEFOBID) of 966 straits of microorganisms, isolated from 661 patients was assessed. The study was carried out according to the trial described by Bauer et al, using the Mueller-Hinton medium and original cephaperasone tests (Pfizer). Full sensitivity was found in 87.1% of the organisms. The following conclusions were made: 1. Most isolated organisms were sensitivite to cephaperasone (87.1%); E. coli (98.5%), Kl. Pneumoniae (94.8%), Atrobacter (93.1%), Enterobacter (92.8%), Klebsiella sp (92.5%). Lowered sensitivity was seen in Pseudomonas sp. (70.9%), Acinobacter (70.8%) and Alcaligenes (58.3%). 2. Cross-resistance with other cephalosporines was found in 27.8% of the cases. In 52.4% full sensitivity to cephaperasone was found, and resistance to other clinically used cephalosporines.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  - Imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. To test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several Medical Centers in Brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding MIC were carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of S. Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. Our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding MIC correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). Of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (E. coli), 93% (Pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (Staphylococcus aureus), 100% (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (Klebsiella sp), 97% (Proteus mirabiles), 94% (Enterobacter sp), 100% (Streptococcus faecalis) with good MIC correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species Bacteroides sp (MIC up to 4 micrograms/ml). "In vitro" efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably Bacteroides sp is emphasized.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - A morphological study of the action of equine anti-lipopolysaccharide plasma on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Three strains of gram-negative bacteria--one each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp.--were treated with anti-lipopolysaccharide hyperimmune equine plasma (anti-LPS) or non-immune control plasma and examined by scanning electronmicroscopy. Within a few minutes of treatment with anti-LPS, bacteria were agglutinated. Evidence of cell membrane destruction was observed shortly thereafter and total cell disintegration and disruption occurred within 1-2 h. In contrast, non-immune plasma had no effect on cell morphology. This confirms the findings in previous microbiological studies that specific antibodies in anti-LPS bind to lipopolysaccharide (LPS endotoxin), and thereby initiate the destruction of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro activities of 7 antimicrobial agents against organisms (474 strains) isolated from patients with various infections in Ehime University Hospital from May to July 1986 were investigated. Summarized results are as follows: 1. Aztreonam (AZT) showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 2. Antimicrobial activities of AZT were especially superior against Proteus sp. to the third generation cephem antibiotics. 3. Enterobacter sp. seemed more susceptible to AZT than to cephem antibiotics, but minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT against may isolates of Enterobacter sp. were in wide ranges.
TI  - Differences in antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates in Saudi Arabia and the United States.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of 3,530 clinical isolates at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH), in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were compared with those of 11,041 bacterial isolates at two hospitals of comparable size in the United States. The gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, Proteus-Morganella group, Enterobacter sp, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally more resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at KFSH than in the United States. A larger number of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were more resistant to cephalosporin, chloramphenical, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at one of the tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Hemophilus influenzae and gram-positive cocci exhibited similar susceptibilities toward commonly used antibiotics at all three institutions.
TI  - Bacterial Growth Rates and Competition Affect Nodulation and Root Colonization by Rhizobium meliloti.
AB  - The addition of streptomycin to nonsterile soil suppressed the numbers of bacterial cells in the rhizosphere of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) for several days, resulted in the enhanced growth of a streptomycin-resistant strain of Rhizobium meliloti, and increased the numbers of nodules on the alfalfa roots. A bacterial mixture inoculated into sterile soil inhibited the colonization of alfalfa roots by R. meliloti, caused a diminution in the number of nodules, and reduced plant growth. Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas marginalis, Acinetobacter sp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae suppressed the colonization by R. meliloti of roots grown on agar and reduced nodulation by R. meliloti, the suppression of nodulation being statistically significant for the first three species. Bradyrhizobium sp. and "Sarcina lutea" did not suppress root colonization nor nodulation by R. meliloti. The doubling times in the rhizosphere for E. aerogenes, P. marginalis, Acinetobacter sp., and K. pneumoniae were less and the doubling times for Bradyrhizobium sp. and "S. lutea" were greater than the doubling time of R. meliloti. Under the same conditions, Arthrobacter citreus injured alfalfa roots. We suggest that competition by soil bacteria reduces nodulation by rhizobia in soil and that the extent of inhibition is related to the growth rates of the rhizosphere bacteria.
TI  - BRL-36650: in vitro studies and assessment of serum bactericidal activity after single-dose administration in volunteers.
AB  - Ten healthy volunteers received 1 g of BRL-36650, a new formamido-penicillin derivative, given by intravenous infusion over 15 min. Levels in serum were measured microbiologically 30, 60, and 120 min after the start of the 15-min infusion and were (mean +/- standard deviation) 102.7 +/- 28.4, 59.7 +/- 11.5, and 9.6 +/- 1.9 mg/liter, respectively. A total of 10 strains each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia spp., and Enterobacter spp. and 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were selected according to their susceptibility or resistance to piperacillin for the study of serum bactericidal activity (SBA). The MICs and MBCs of these strains were influenced by the choice of medium. Median SBA against E. coli and K. pneumoniae were greater than or equal to 1:2,048 and 1:512, respectively. The SBA against piperacillin-susceptible Serratia spp. (1:256), Enterobacter spp. (1:128), and P. aeruginosa (1:32) were significantly higher than against piperacillin-resistant strains (1:32, 1:8, and 1:4, respectively). Killing curves confirmed the high bactericidal activities obtained against the majority of strains. In the case of one Enterobacter sp. and one P. aeruginosa isolate with an MBC greater than or equal to 32, the absence of killing was noted.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - Bacteraemia at the University Hospital of the West Indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  - A total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the University Hospital of the West Indies between June 1982 and June 1983. This gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. The 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 Gram-positive and 133 Gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. Highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over 50 years of age. Septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms was predominantly a disease of children whereas that caused by Gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. A predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. The most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. Most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to the departments of medicine or paediatrics. There were 11 cases of polymicrobial septicaemia caused predominantly by Gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. Appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. In those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. Forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia. Mortality from septicaemia caused by Gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by Gram-positive organisms. The organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were Escherichia coli, 53%; Enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. There were no deaths from septicaemia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. or Serratia sp. The highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Amifloxacin activity against well-defined gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Amifloxacin (WIN 49375) activity against a well-defined group of gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli was compared with the activity of 11 other antimicrobial agents. For all strains, amifloxacin and norfloxacin were the most active agents, followed by cefotaxime and moxalactam. For Acinetobacter sp. only amifloxacin had an achievable MIC for 90% of the strains. Amifloxacin joins other newly developed DNA gyrase inhibitors as potentially useful agents for infections due to aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  - The combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of D-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. The results showed that all five strains of Escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. Similar results were obtained with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Within the Salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the E. coli strains. The combining sites of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of Salmonella sp. and E. coli. The results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Alternative prey: a mechanism for elimination of bacterial species by protozoa.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae  died readily after their addition to raw sewage, but they grew in sterilized sewage. The decline was not a result of abiotic stresses, and because the bacteria were able to survive in large numbers for at least 15 days in solutions containing no organic nutrients, it was not a result of competition. Toxin production, bacteriophages, and Bdellovibrio sp. did not cause the disappearance of the two bacterial species. A decline was also evident if the sewage was first passed through a 3-micron (pore size) filter or treated with cycloheximide or cycloheximide plus nystatin, but protozoa developed under these conditions. Little or no decline occurred if the sewage was filtered and treated with the eucaryotic inhibitors before the addition of S. typhimurium or K. pneumoniae, and protozoa were not detected. S. typhimurium increased in abundance if cycloheximide, streptomycin, and erythromycin or large amounts of glucose were added to sewage. Tetrahymena thermophilus did not significantly reduce the population of S. typhimurium in buffer when the density of the bacterium was about 10(4)/ml. However, when more than 10(8) Enterobacter agglomerans cells per ml were added to the buffer, T. thermophilus reduced the abundance of E. agglomerans and S. typhimurium to 10(6) and 10/ml, respectively. The density of S. typhimurium was further decreased by a second increment of E. agglomerans cells. The disappearance of S. typhimurium and K. pneumoniae from sewage thus is the result of predation by protozoa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - Nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction) of root-associated, cold-climate azospirillum, enterobacter, Klebsiella, and pseudomonas species during growth on various carbon sources and at various partial pressures of oxygen.
AB  - A comprehensive view of the diazotrophic bacterial flora of plants requires that  attention be paid to the appropriate carbon and oxygen requirements during isolation of the bacteria. Twenty compounds (monosaccharides, disaccharides, polyols, and organic acids) were therefore examined as carbon and energy sources for nitrogenase activity in semisolid stab cultures at pO(2) values of 0.21, 0.02, and </=0.002 with 12 strains of diazotrophic root-associated bacteria. With the facultatively anaerobic bacteria of the genera Klebsiella and Enterobacter, the best substrate was sucrose, followed by fructose and mannitol, whereas among the organic acids, only malic and fumaric acids supported any activity. With the obligately aerobic bacteria of the genera Azospirillum and Pseudomonas, disaccharides were not utilized for nitrogen fixation, but several organic acids were accepted in addition to monosaccharides and polyols; malate and glucose were the best substrates. The patterns of the carbon sources utilized for nitrogen fixation were coherent within the species, with the exception of one Klebsiella pneumoniae and one Enterobacter agglomerans strain, both isolated from the same individual grass plant, which were unable to utilize lactose. Anaerobic conditions (pO(2) value of </=0.002) were required for maximum nitrogenase activity with the facultatively anaerobic bacteria, with the exception of one strain of E. agglomerans, which required atmospheric oxygen (pO(2) value of 0.21). Also, the obligately aerobic diazotrophs required atmospheric oxygen for maximum nitrogenase activity. The maximum specific nitrogenase activities (expressed as micromoles of C(2)H(4) . milligram of bacterial protein . hour) noted during the exponential growth phase of the bacteria were the following: 2.68 with Azospirillum lipoferum on malate, 2.41 with K. pneumoniae and 1.58 with E. agglomerans on sucrose, and 0.95 with Pseudomonas sp. on malate.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - Reliability of early identifications obtained with Enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  - The AutoMicrobic system (AMS) is capable of identifying most Enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. Early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. Data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. All AutoMicrobic system identifications with probability (P) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. Analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter sp., Yersinia spp., Salmonella spp. (other than Salmonella typhi), Shigella spp. (other than Shigella sonnei), Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas spp. (other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas maltophilia), Klebsiella spp. (other than Klebsiella pneumoniae or Klebsiella oxytoca), Citrobacter amalonauticus, Serratia liquefaciens, or Vibrio spp. Should be considered nonspecific responses, even when P greater than or equal to 0.80. Other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. At least half of our isolates (60% of our Enterobacteriaceae) could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.
TI  - Synergistic effect of cephalexin with mecillinam.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo synergistic effects of cephalexin and mecillinam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and Proteus sp. were demonstrated and their action mechanism were also discussed. The growth curve after the exposure of cephalexin and mecillinam at the concentrations at which these antibiotics had no effects when given alone showed a decreased of the turbidity and the presence of a bactericidal effect. In experimental infection in mice, the combination of both drugs showed a synergistic effect and excellent therapeutic effect. The blood concentration ratio of cephalexin to mecillinam was coincident with the concentration ratio of these antibiotics at which the synergistic effect was observed in vitro. Phase-contrast and scanning electron somewhat elongated bacteria and formation of spindle cells with swelling in the central part. A leakage of the cellular contents from part of the swelled cell wall was observed by transmission electron microscope. Cephalexin showed an affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)-1a and 3 in Escherichia coli and mecillinam showed an affinity for PBP-2. When these antibiotics were used concurrently, they exerted an additive effect to increase the affinity for PBPs. The lytic activity was increased much more after the combination of two antibiotics than after a single exposure.
TI  - Root-associated n(2) fixation (acetylene reduction) by enterobacteriaceae and azospirillum strains in cold-climate spodosols.
AB  - N(2) fixation by bacteria in associative symbiosis with washed roots of 13 Poaceae and 8 other noncultivated plant species in Finland was demonstrated by the acetylene reduction method. The roots most active in C(2)H(2) reduction were those of Agrostis stolonifera, Calamagrostis lanceolata, Elytrigia repens, and Phalaris arundinacea, which produced 538 to 1,510 nmol of C(2)H(4).g (dry weight). h when incubated at pO(2) 0.04 with sucrose (pH 6.5), and 70 to 269 nmol of C(2)H(4). g (dry weight).h without an added energy source and unbuffered. Azospirillum lipferum, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and a Pseudomonas sp. were the acetylene-reducing organisms isolated. The results demonstrate the presence of N(2)-fixing organisms in associative symbiosis with plant roots found in a northern climatic region in acidic soils ranging down to pH 4.0.
TI  - Dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  - Dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. A computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. The computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the API 20E and 50E, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on MacConkey's bile salt medium. Dinitrogen-fixing Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the API analytical profile index. Nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (Azotobacter spp., Azospirillum spp., Derxia sp., Rhodospirillum sp., Clostridium sp., and Bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. The API tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. The use of the API 20E and 50E tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin, piperacillin, Bay k 4999 with carbenicillin and ticarcillin against enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of five penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and Bay k 4999) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole positive Proteus sp. and Enterobacter species was determined by an agar dilution method. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were found to be the most active of the semi-synthetic penicillins tested against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Bay k 4999 was slightly more active than piperacillin against E. coli, about as active as piperacillin against Pseudomonas, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus, but more active than piperacillin against Enterobacter species.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - The activity of LY127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. LY127935 exhibited striking activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., Serratia marcescens, and B. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was somewhat less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus. Cefotaxime (HR 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against B. fragilis. LY127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Pharyngeal colonization by gram-negative bacilli in aspiration-prone persons.
AB  - We compared the prevalence of Gram-negative bacilli in the pharyngeal flora of two groups of patients with a known predilection for Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia (chronic alcoholics and diabetics), two other groups of aspiration-prone persons with no known predilection for Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia (epileptics and narcotic addicts), and normal control subjects. Quantitative cultures of saline gargles showed pharyngeal Gram-negative bacilli to be significantly (P less than .05) more prevalent among alcoholics (35%) and diabetics (36%) but not epileptics (17%) or addicts (20%) than controls (18%). Counts of greater than or equal to 100 Gram-negative bacilli per milliliter were also significantly more common in alcoholics (14%) and diabetics (24%) than controls (5%, P less than .05). Enterobacter sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were the most common Gram-negative bacilli isolated. Increased colonization by Gram-negative bacilli might be a factor contributing to the propensity of alcoholics and diabetics for Gram-negative pneumonia.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of fosfomycin in clinical studies.
AB  - Since fosfomycin has behaved in vitro as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, an attempt  has been made to evaluate this behaviour in controlled clinical study carried out at different Spanish hospitals. A total of 959 patients were treated for some of the following infectious clinical processes: gonococcal urethritis, typhoid fever, enterocolitis, acute and chronic urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, chronic otorrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis, peritonitis, surgical and suppurative infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngoamygdalitis, burns, endometritis, ocular infection, whooping cough and nasal carriers of S. aureus. The results obtained as a function of the microorganism isolated in these clinical processes in percentage of clinical and bacteriological success have been 96% of the S. aureus infections, 95% of the Streptococcus sp. including S. pneumoniae, 90% of the N. gonorrhoeae infections, 94% of the E. coli infections including enteropathogenic E. coli, 90% of the S. marcescens infections, 76% of the Proteus sp. infections, 72% of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter infections, 66% of P. aeruginosa infections and 78% of the S. typhi infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus (Herellea vaginicola) to minocycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of minocycline against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus (Herellea vaginicola) was examined. All strains of A. anitratus were inhibited by minocycline at concentrations of 0.4 mug/ml or less. The strains studied were considerably more susceptible to minocycline than tetracycline. No difference between the susceptibility to minocycline and tetracycline was seen with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter and Proteus sp. A regression line of the log minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and the diameter of the zone of inhibition, determined by the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed good linear correlation for minocycline. Comparison of the disk diffusion results and MICs indicated that an inhibitory zone size of 19 mm produced by a 30-mug minocycline disk was equivalent to a MIC of 3.1 mug/ml, a serum concentration achieved by oral administration of the drug. When the zone of inhibition was greater than 19 mm, however, there was poor correlation with the MIC for Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  - In a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in Oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated infections. Within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. By age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. Staphylococcus aureus and E coli were isolated more frequently in the younger group, while K pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. A higher frequency of Enterobacter sp and S aureus were isolated among male patients, while Candida albicans and E coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none of these differences by sex were statistically significant. Over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.
TI  - In vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. Cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against Proteus mirabilis. Both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against S. aureus, were slightly more active against K. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against E. coli. All strains of indole-positive Proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. Eighty-eight percent of Enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin and cephalothin, respectively. Peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110 mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg) in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. These levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. There was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. The percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. The half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.
TI  - Microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, BL-S 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
AB  - BL-S 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.
TI  - Degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  - We have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Four of these cultures were identified as Aerobacter aerogenes, two as Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as Serratia killiensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus species. Another culture identified as P. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. When 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, A. aerogenes, B. subtilis, Mycobacterium phlei, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens were able to grow. These five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. In all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. Induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of A. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, S. kiliensis, S. marcescens, B. subtilis, and Bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. Of these organisms, only Bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.
TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
