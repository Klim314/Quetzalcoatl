TI  == effects of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. here, effects of a probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and two novel porcine isolates, lactobacillus johnsonii strain p47-hy and lactobacillus reuteri strain p43-huv, on cytoprotective hsp expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine ipec-j2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. the ipec-j2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. western blot analysis detected hsp expression in ipec-j2 and revealed that l. johnsonii and l. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce hsp27, despite high basal expression in ipec-j2, whereas lgg did not. for hsp72, only the supernatant of l. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that hsp72 expression was more stimulus specific. the protective effect of lactobacilli was  further studied in ipec-j2 under an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. etec caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced ipec-j2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical  resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. in contrast, the l. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. l. johnsonii and lgg also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting etec attachment. together, the  results indicate that specific strains of lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective hsp induction and fortify the cell protection against etec challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, for growth in milk.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri is a widespread commensal lactic acid bacterium inhabiting  human mucosal niches and has many beneficial effects as a probiotic. however, l.  gasseri is difficult to grow in milk, which hurts usability for the food industry. it had been previously reported that supplementation with yeast extract or proteose peptone, including peptides, enables l. gasseri to grow well in milk. in this study, our objective was to confirm peptide requirement of l. gasseri and evaluate efficacy of peptide release by enzymatic proteolysis on growth of l. gassei in milk. three strains of l. gasseri did not grow well in modified deman,  rogosa, sharpe broth without any nitrogen sources (mrs-n), but addition of a casein-derived peptide mixture, tryptone, promoted growth. in contrast, little effect was observed after adding casein or a casein-derived amino acid mixture, casamino acids. these results indicate that l. gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, among milk-derived nitrogen sources for growth. lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t hardly had growth capacity in 6 kinds of milk-based media: bovine milk, human milk, skim milk, cheese whey, modified mrs-n (mrsl-n) supplemented with acid whey, and mrsl-n supplemented with casein. moreover, treatment with digestive proteases, particularly pepsin, to release peptides made it grow well in each milk-based medium. the pepsin treatment was the most effective for growth of strain jcm 1131t in skim milk among the tested food-grade proteases such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, calf rennet, ficin, bromelain, and papain. as well as strain jcm 1131t, pepsinolysis of milk improved growth of other l. gasseri strains and some strains of enteric lactobacilli such  as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus reuteri. these results suggest that some relatives of l. gasseri also use peptides as desirable nitrogen sources, and that milk may be a good supplier of nutritious peptides to enteric lactobacilli including l. gasseri after peptic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. this is the first report showing peptide requirement of l. gasseri and efficacy of pepsinolysis on the growth of l. gasseri and its relatives in milk. this study would contribute to increasing usability of l. gasseri and its relatives as probiotics in dairy foods.

TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effects of a yeast-dried milk product in creep and phase-1 nursery diets on growth performance, circulating immunoglobulin a, and fecal microbiota of nursing and nursery pigs.
AB  == four experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of yeast-dried milk (ydm) product in creep and phase-1 nursery diets. in exp. 1, 24 parity-4 litters were allotted to 3 dietary treatments (8 litters/treatment) including no creep (nc), control creep (ctl), and experimental creep (ec; 10% ydm). creep diets were fed twice daily from d 7 after birth until weaning (23.6 +/- 1.8 d). in exp. 2, 108 weaned pigs were selected based on mean bw of pigs from the respective treatments in exp. 1. for phase 1 (d 0 to 7 postweaning) of exp. 2, nc and ctl pigs were fed the ctl diet and ec pigs continued to receive the ec diet. for phase 2 and 3 (d 7 to 28 postweaning) of exp. 2, all pigs received a common diet containing antibiotics. blood and fecal samples were collected on d 0, 7, 14, and 21 postweaning to evaluate serum iga and fecal microbiota. in exp. 1, pigs fed ec and ctl tended to have greater (p < 0.10) weaning bw compared with nc pigs. pigs  fed ec had greater (p < 0.05) adfi compared with ctl pigs. in exp. 2, pigs fed ec tended to have greater bw (p < 0.10) and greater adg (p < 0.05) and adfi (p < 0.01) compared with ctl and nc pigs (d 0 to 28). for serum iga, ec and ctl pigs tended (p < 0.10) to have greater iga compared with nc pigs. for microbial data,  ec pigs had greater (p < 0.01) microbial diversity compared with ctl (d 7 postweaning). on d 7 and 21 postweaning, microbial similarity decreased (p < 0.01) in pigs fed ec compared with nc and ctl. overall (d 0 to 14), lactobacilli  gene copy numbers tended (p < 0.10) to be greater in ec (7.3 log10) compared with nc pigs (6.9 log10). in exp. 3, 23 parity-1 litters were allotted to 3 dietary treatments as described for exp. 1. in exp. 4, 108 weaned pigs were selected based on mean bw of all pigs from exp. 3 and dietary treatments were the same as  described for exp. 2 except no antibiotic was included in phase-2 diet. in exp. 3, there were no treatment effects on litter adfi, adg, and serum iga, but a tendency (p < 0.10) for lower lactobacillus reuteri in the ctl (5.1 log10) compared with nc pigs (5.6 log10) was observed. overall (d 0 to 21) in exp. 4, pigs fed ec had greater adg (p < 0.01) and g:f (p < 0.05) and tended to exhibit greater adfi (p < 0.10) compared with the ctl. for microbial data, pigs fed ctl (4.8 log10) and ec (4.8 log10) had lower (p < 0.01) fecal lactobacillus johnsonii compared with nc (5.2 log10). microbial ecology and immune parameters are affected by ydm.

TI  == anti-inflammatory and intestinal barrier-protective activities of commensal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in thoroughbreds: role of probiotics in diarrhea  prevention in neonatal thoroughbreds.
AB  == we previously isolated the commensal bacteria lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from the thoroughbred intestine and prepared the horse probiotics lacfi(tm), consisting of lactobacillus ruminis kk14, l. equi kk 15, l. reuteri kk18, l. johnsonii kk21, and bifidobacterium boum hu. here, we found that the five lacfi(tm) constituent strains remarkably suppressed pro-inflammatory interleukin-17 production in mouse splenocytes stimulated with interleukin-6 and  transforming growth factor-beta. the protective effects of the probiotic on impaired intestinal barrier function were evaluated in caco-2 cells treated with  tumor necrosis factor-alpha. evaluation of transepithelial resistance showed that all the strains exhibited intestinal barrier protective activity, with significant suppression of barrier impairment by l. reuteri kk18. the lacfi(tm) constituent strains were detected in neonatal lacfi(tm)-administered thoroughbred feces using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culture methods. these five strains were found to be the predominant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of lacfi(tm)-administered thoroughbreds. administration of lacfi(tm) to neonatal thoroughbreds decreased diarrhea incidence from 75.9% in the control group (n=29 neonatal thoroughbreds)  to 30.7% in the lacfi(tm)-administered group (n=101 neonatal thoroughbreds) immediately after birth to 20 weeks after birth. lacfi(tm) treatment also prevented diarrhea especially at and around 4 weeks and from 10 to 16 weeks. the  duration of diarrhea was also shorter in the probiotics-administered group (7.4 +/- 0.8 days) than in the control group (14.0 +/- 3.2 days). these results indicate that the lacfi(tm) probiotics regulates intestinal function and contributes to diarrhea prevention.

TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == analysis of the microbial ecology between helicobacter pylori and the gastric microbiota of mongolian gerbils.
AB  == animal models are essential for in vivo analysis of helicobacter-related diseases. mongolian gerbils are used frequently to study helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis and its consequences. the presence of some gastric microbiota with a suppressive effect on h. pylori suggests inhibitory gastric bacteria against h. pylori infection. the aim of the present study was to analyse the microbial ecology between h. pylori and the gastric microbiota of mongolian gerbils. gastric mucosa samples of h. pylori-negative and -positive gerbils were  orally inoculated to five (group 1) and six (group 2) gerbils, respectively, and  the gerbils were challenged with h. pylori infection. the colonization rate (40 %) of h. pylori in group 1 gerbils was lower than the rate (67 %) in group 2 gerbils. culture filtrate of the gastric mucosa samples of group 1 gerbils inhibited the in vitro growth of h. pylori. three lactobacilli species, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus murinus, were isolated by anaerobic culture from the gerbils in groups 1 and 2, and identified  by genomic sequencing. it was demonstrated that the three different strains of lactobacilli exhibited an inhibitory effect on the in vitro growth of h. pylori.  the results suggested that lactobacilli are the dominant gastric microbiota of mongolian gerbils and the three lactobacilli isolated from the gastric mucosa samples with an inhibitory effect on h. pylori might have an anti-infective effect against h. pylori.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == the role of conserved inulosucrase residues in the reaction and product specificity of lactobacillus reuteri inulosucrase.
AB  == the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri 121 produces two fructosyltransferase enzymes, a levansucrase and an inulosucrase. although these  two fructosyltransferase enzymes share high sequence similarity, they differ significantly in the type and size distribution of fructooligosaccharide products synthesized from sucrose, and in their activity levels. in order to examine the contribution of specific amino acids to such differences, 15 single and four multiple inulosucrase mutants were designed that affected residues that are conserved in inulosucrase enzymes, but not in levansucrase enzymes. the effects of the mutations were interpreted using the 3d structures of bacillus subtilis levansucrase (sacb) and lactobacillus johnsonii inulosucrase (inuj). the wild-type inulosucrase synthesizes mostly fructooligosaccharides up to a degree of polymerization of 15 and relatively low amounts of inulin polymer. in contrast, wild-type levansucrase produces mainly levan polymer and fructooligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization < 5. although most of the  inulosucrase mutants in this study behaved similarly to the wild-type enzyme, the mutation g416e, at the rim of the active site pocket in loop 415-423, increased the hydrolytic activity twofold, without significantly changing the transglycosylation activity. the septuple mutant gm4 (t413k, k415r, g416e, a425p, s442n, w486l, p516l), which included two residues from the above-mentioned loop 415-423, synthesized 1-kestose only, but at low efficiency. mutation a538s, located behind the general acid/base, increased the enzyme activity two to threefold. mutation n543s, located adjacent to the +1/+2 sub-site residue r544, resulted in synthesis of not such a wide variety of fructooligosaccharides than the wild-type enzyme. the present study demonstrates that the product specificity of inulosucrase is easily altered by protein engineering, obtaining inulosucrase  variants with higher transglycosylation specificity, higher catalytic rates and different fructooligosaccharide size distributions, without changing the beta(2-1) linkage type in the product.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == improved bioavailability of dietary phenolic acids in whole grain barley and oat  groat following fermentation with probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus , lactobacillus johnsonii , and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the aim of this study was to improve the bioavailability of the dietary phenolic  acids in flours from whole grain barley and oat groat following fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (lab) exhibiting high feruloyl esterase activity (fae). the  highest increase of free phenolic acids was observed after fermentation with three probiotic strains, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus reuteri sd2112, and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, with maximum increases from 2.55 to 69.91 mug g(-1) dm and from 4.13 to 109.42 mug g(-1) dm in whole grain barley and oat groat, respectively. interestingly, higher amounts of bound phenolic acids were detected after both water treatment and lab fermentation in whole grain barley, indicating higher bioaccessibility, whereas some decrease was detected in oat groat. to conclude, cereal fermentation with specific probiotic strains can lead to significant increase of free phenolic acids, thereby improving their bioavailability.

TI  == bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic lactobacillus, staphylococcus and streptococcus species.
AB  == human symbiotic bacteria, lactobacillus reuteri (lr) in the intestines, staphylococcus epidermidis (se) in skin and streptococcus salivalis (ss) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (dh-dg) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (pg) and cardiolipin (cl), together with mono-  to tetrahexaosyl dgs. the molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the dg moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for lr, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for se, and 16:0 and 18:1 for ss, respectively. the carbohydrate structures of dh-dgs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being galalpha1-2glcalpha for lr, glcbeta1-6glcbeta for se, and glcalpha1-2glcalpha for ss, respectively. also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. anti-l. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs, in which galalpha was bound to dh-dg through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with dh-dg from lr. although anti-se antiserum preferentially reacted with dh-dg from se, anti-ss antiserum reacted with dh-dg from ss and, to a lesser extent, with dh-dgs from lr and se. but, both anti-se and anti-ss antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl dg or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. in addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the abo blood group, were found to contain igm to tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs from lr, but not to dh-dgs from lr, se and ss.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == resource partitioning in relation to cohabitation of lactobacillus species in the mouse forestomach.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of gut communities of vertebrates is advanced, but the relationships, especially at the trophic level, between commensals that share gut habitats of monogastric animals have not been investigated to any extent. lactobacillus reuteri strain 100-23 and lactobacillus johnsonii strain 100-33 cohabit in the forestomach of mice. according to the niche exclusion principle, this should not be possible because both strains can utilise the two main fermentable carbohydrates present in the stomach digesta: glucose and maltose. we show, based on gene transcription analysis, in vitro physiological assays, and in vivo experiments that the two strains can co-exist in the forestomach habitat because 100-23 grows more rapidly using maltose, whereas 100-33 preferentially utilises glucose. mutation of the maltose phosphorylase gene (mala) of strain 100-23 prevented its growth on maltose-containing culture medium, and resulted in the numerical dominance of 100-33 in the forestomach. the fundamental niche of l. reuteri 100-23 in the mouse forestomach can be defined in terms of 'glucose and maltose trophism'. however, its realised niche when l. johnsonii 100-33 is present is 'maltose trophism'. hence, nutritional adaptations provide niche differentiation that assists cohabitation by the two strains through resource partitioning in the mouse forestomach. this real life, trophic phenomenon conforms to a mathematical model based on in vitro bacterial doubling times, in vitro transport rates, and concentrations of maltose and glucose in mouse stomach digesta.

AB  == this study was conducted to isolate psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (lab) from chicken carcasses with inhibitory activity against strains of salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes. a total of 100 broiler samples were examined for the presence of lab. ninety-two lab isolates that showed antimicrobial effects against salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes were further analysed to examine their lab (gram-positive, catalase negative, oxidase negative) and psychrotrophic characteristics (ability to grow at 7 degrees c). fifty isolates were further selected and identified initially using standard biochemical tests in miniature (micro-kits api ch 50) and then by sequencing of the 16s-23s rrna gene boundary region (intergenic spacer region). by molecular identification, these isolates were classified into 5 different lab species: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus johnsonii, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactobacillus paralimentarius. none of the isolates produced tyramine or histamine.

TI  == characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  == anti-lactobacillus johnsonii (lj) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with lj reacted with glyceroglycolipids in lj, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (dh-dg), trihexaosyl dg (th-dg) and tetrahexaosyl dg (teth-dg), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. structural analyses of glycolipids from lj revealed that dh-dg was galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, and th-dg and teth-dg were novel derivatives of it with alpha-gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and galalpha1-6galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, respectively. dh-dg was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but teth-dg was restricted to lj, l. intestinalis and l. reuteri, while the th-dgs from l. casei were glc1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and an esterified derivative of it, glc1-6galalpha1-2glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'dg, as reported in the literature. anti-lj antisera reacted with th-dg and esterified th-dg from l. casei to lesser  extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl dg from staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl dg from streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-gal residues. the major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. also, human igm antibodies against th-dg and teth-dg from  lj were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an  immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, th-dg and teth-dg.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

TI  == impact of ecological factors on the stability of microbial associations in sourdough fermentation.
AB  == the limits for the stability of the microbial association 1 (lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and candida humilis) and association 2 (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus johnsonii and issatchenkia orientalis) during sourdough fermentation were evaluated by investigating the effects of the ecological factors substrate, refreshment time, temperature, amount of backslopping and competing species in different combinations on their growth. sourdoughs were fermented in 28 batches under different conditions using the associations and possible competing strains as starters. the dominating microbiota was characterized by bacteriological culture, rrna gene sequence analysis and rapd-pcr. association 1 was found to be competitive in doughs with rye and wheat  flour at temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees c, refreshment times of 12 and 24 h, amounts of backslopping dough from 5 to 20% and against all competing lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. the processing parameters for the competitiveness of the association 2 were temperatures of 35-40 degrees c, refreshment times of 12-24 h and the substrates rye bran, wheat and rye flour, but not in every case.  issatchenkia orientalis could only grow when enough oxygen was available. its cell counts fell rapidly under the limit of detection when using high amounts of  doughs (small ratio of surface to volume) and refreshment times of 12 h. in conclusion, the results demonstrated that the two associations were remarkably stable under most of the investigated process conditions.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == inhibition of type 1 diabetes correlated to a lactobacillus johnsonii n6.2-mediated th17 bias.
AB  == although it is known that resident gut flora contribute to immune system function and homeostasis, their role in the progression of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (t1d) is poorly understood. comparison of stool samples isolated from bio-breeding rats, a classic model of t1d, shows that distinct bacterial populations reside in spontaneous bio-breeding diabetes-prone (bbdp) and bio-breeding diabetes-resistant animals. we have previously shown that the oral transfer of lactobacillus johnsonii strain n6.2 (ljn6.2) from bio-breeding diabetes-resistant to bbdp rodents conferred t1d resistance to bbdp rodents, whereas lactobacillus reuteri strain td1 did not. in this study, we show that diabetes resistance in ljn6.2-fed bbdp rodents was correlated to a th17 cell bias within the mesenteric lymph nodes. the th17 bias was not observed in the non-gut-draining axillary lymph nodes, suggesting that the th17 bias was because  of immune system interactions with ljn6.2 within the mesenteric lymph node. ljn6.2 interactions with the immune system were observed in the spleens of diabetes-resistant, ljn6.2-fed bbdp rats, as they also possessed a th17 bias in comparison with control or lactobacillus reuteri strain td1-fed rats. using c57bl/6 mouse in vitro assays, we show that ljn6.2 directly mediated enhanced th17 differentiation of lymphocytes in the presence of tcr stimulation, which required apcs. finally, we show that footpad vaccination of nod mice with ljn6.2-pulsed dendritic cells was sufficient to mediate a th17 bias in vivo. together, these data suggest an interesting paradigm whereby t1d induction can be circumvented by gut flora-mediated th17 differentiation.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == lactobacillus johnsonii n6.2 mitigates the development of type 1 diabetes in bb-dp rats.
AB  == background: the intestinal epithelium is a barrier that composes one of the most  immunologically active surfaces of the body due to constant exposure to microorganisms as well as an infinite diversity of food antigens. disruption of intestinal barrier function and aberrant mucosal immune activation have been implicated in a variety of diseases within and outside of the gastrointestinal tract. with this model in mind, recent studies have shown a link between diet, composition of intestinal microbiota, and type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. in the biobreeding rat model of type 1 diabetes, comparison of the intestinal microbial  composition of diabetes prone and diabetes resistant animals found lactobacillus  species were negatively correlated with type 1 diabetes development. two species, lactobacillus johnsonii and l. reuteri, were isolated from diabetes resistant rats. in this study diabetes prone rats were administered pure cultures of l. johnsonii or l. reuteri isolated from diabetes resistant rats to determine the effect on type 1 diabetes development. methodology/principal: findings results rats administered l. johnsonii, but not l. reuteri, post-weaning developed type 1 diabetes at a protracted rate. analysis of the intestinal ileum showed administration of l. johnsonii induced changes in the native microbiota, host mucosal proteins, and host oxidative stress response. a decreased oxidative intestinal environment was evidenced by decreased expression of several oxidative response proteins in the intestinal mucosa (gpx1, gr, cat). in l. johnsonii fed animals low levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine ifngamma were correlated with low levels of inos and high levels of cox2. the administration of l. johnsonii also resulted in higher levels of the tight junction protein claudin. conclusions: it was determined that the administration of l. johnsonii isolated from biobreeding diabetes resistant rats delays or inhibits the onset of type 1 diabetes in biobreeding diabetes prone rats. taken collectively, these data suggest that the gut and the gut microbiota are potential agents of influence in  type 1 diabetes development. these data also support therapeutic efforts that seek to modify gut microbiota as a means to modulate development of this disorder.

TI  == comparison and utilization of repetitive-element pcr techniques for typing lactobacillus isolates from the chicken gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == three repetitive-element pcr techniques were evaluated for the ability to type strains of lactobacillus species commonly identified in the chicken gastrointestinal tract. enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr (eric-pcr) produced species- and strain-specific profiles for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus reuteri isolates. the technique typed strains within these species equally as well as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. dna concentration and quality did not affect the eric-pcr profiles, indicating that this method, unlike other high-resolution methods, can be adapted to high-throughput analysis of isolates.  subsequently, eric-pcr was used to type lactobacillus species diversity of a large collection of isolates derived from chickens grown under commercial and necrotic enteritis disease induction conditions. this study has illustrated, for  the first time, that there is great strain diversity within each lactobacillus species present and has revealed that chickens raised under commercial conditions harbor greater species and strain diversity than chickens raised under necrotic enteritis disease induction conditions.

AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  == elemental diet (ed) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for crohn's disease. however, the precise mechanisms of ed remain unclear. in interleukin-10  (il-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ed using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ed. ed significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. the total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ed. t-rflp profiles of the ed group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. the diversity of bacterial species in the ed group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. lactobacillus reuteri and l. johnsonii decreased and  enterococcus faecalis and e. durans increased in the ed group. the culture supernatant of l. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-6 activity in raw 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of e. faecalis and e. durans barely induced their activity. these data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ed seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.

TI  == glucosyltransferase a (gtfa) and inulosucrase (inu) of lactobacillus reuteri tmw1.106 contribute to cell aggregation, in vitro biofilm formation, and colonization of the mouse gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == members of the genus lactobacillus are common inhabitants of the proximal gastrointestinal tract of animals such as mice, rats, chickens and pigs, where they form epithelial biofilms. little is known about the traits that facilitate biofilm formation and gut colonization. this study investigated the ecological role of a glucosyltransferase (gtfa) and inulosucrase (inu) of lactobacillus reuteri tmw1.106 and a fructosyltransferase (ftfa) of l. reuteri lth5448. in vitro experiments using isogenic mutants revealed that gtfa was essential for sucrose-dependent autoaggregation of l. reuteri tmw1.106 cells under acidic conditions, while inactivation of inu slowed the formation of cell aggregates. experiments using an in vitro biofilm assay showed that gtfa and inu contributed  to biofilm formation of l. reuteri tmw1.106. experiments using ex-lactobacillus-free mice revealed that the ecological performance of the inu mutant, but not of the gtfa or ftfa mutant, was reduced in the gastrointestinal tract when in competition with the parental strain. in the absence of competition, the gtfa mutant showed delayed colonization of the murine gut relative to the wild-type. in addition, the gtfa mutant showed reduced ecological performance in competition experiments with lactobacillus johnsonii #21. from the evidence provided in this study we conclude that gtfa and inu confer important ecological attributes of l. reuteri tmw1.106 and contribute to colonization of the mouse gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == dietary supplementation with sorbitol results in selective enrichment of lactobacilli in rat intestine.
AB  == a potential prebiotic action has been ascribed to sorbitol, but in vivo evidence  of this remains scarce. in the present work, the effect of sorbitol was compared  to that of fructo-oligosaccharides (fos) in a rat model. microbiota changes, particularly in lactobacilli, were analyzed on fecal, colonic and cecal samples.  denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons using universal primers showed that fos and sorbitol diets exerted a strong influence upon gut microbiota patterns. when lactobacillus group-specific  primers were used, dgge profiles revealed five dna bands that belonged to lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus sp. ad102, lactobacillus intestinalis, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus reuteri. although these species are present in all dietary groups, quantification by real-time pcr showed that sorbitol and fos intake increased l. reuteri cell numbers, and sorbitol also contributed to maintaining the levels of lactobacillus sp. ad102. analysis of organic acid concentrations showed that sorbitol intake significantly increased colonic and cecal butyrate levels. hence, sorbitol, which is widely used as a low-calorie sweetener, has the capacity, in our animal model, to modify gut microbiota activity in such a way as to possibly contribute to healthy colonic mucosa.

TI  == differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.

AB  == aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition  was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic  potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.

TI  == the effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of lactobacillus ssp. and e. coli o138.
AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection and identification of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces.
AB  == aims: to develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection and identification of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. methods and results:  the specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by dot blot hybridization to 16s rdna and 23s rdna amplified by pcr from 12 lactobacillus type strains and  100 strains of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. oligonucleotide probes specific for each lactobacillus species hybridized only with targeted rdna. the lactobacillus strains isolated from mouse faeces were identified mainly as lactobacillus intestinalis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus and l. reuteri using species-specific probes. 16s rdna of eight unidentified isolates were sequenced and two new probes were designed. four of eight strains of unhybridized lactobacillus were identified as l. johnsonii/gasseri group, and the remaining four strains as l. vaginalis. conclusions: the species-specific probe set of l. intestinalis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus, l. reuteri and l. vaginalis in this study was efficient for rapid identification of lactobacillus isolated from mouse faeces. significance and impact of the study: the oligonucleotide probe set for lactobacillus species harboured in the mouse intestine, can be used for rapid identification of lactobacilli and monitoring of the faecal lactobacillus community.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic studies of murine intestinal lactobacilli: species differences in mice with and without colitis.
AB  == lactobacilli represent components of the commensal mammalian gastrointestinal microbiota and are useful as probiotics, functional foods, and dairy products. this study includes systematic polyphasic analyses of murine intestinal lactobacillus isolates and correlation of taxonomic findings with data from cytokine production assays. lactobacilli were recovered from mice with microbiota-dependent colitis (interleukin-10 [il-10]-deficient c57bl/6 mice) and  from mice without colitis (swiss webster and inducible nitric oxide synthetase-deficient c57bl/6 mice). polyphasic analyses were performed to elucidate taxonomic relationships among 88 reference and murine gastrointestinal  lactobacilli. genotypic tests included single-locus analyses (16s ribosomal dna sequencing and 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region pcr) and genomic dna profiling (repetitive dna element-based pcr), and phenotypic analyses encompassed more than 50 tests for carbohydrate utilization, enzyme production, and antimicrobial resistance. from 20 mice without colitis, six lactobacillus species were recovered; the majority of the mice were colonized with l. reuteri or l. murinus (72% of isolates). in contrast, only, l. johnsonii was isolated from 14 il-10-deficient mice. using an in vitro assay, we screened murine isolates for their ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) secretion by lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. interestingly, a subpopulation of lactobacilli recovered from mice without colitis displayed tnf-alpha inhibitory properties, whereas none of the l. johnsonii isolates from il-10-deficient mice exhibited this effect. we propose that differences among intestinal lactobacillus populations in mammals, combined with host genetic susceptibilities, may account  partly for variations in host mucosal responses.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial population dynamics in sourdough fermentation processes  by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == four sourdoughs (a to d) were produced under practical conditions by using a starter mixture of three commercially available sourdough starters and a baker's  yeast constitutively containing various species of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the sourdoughs were continuously propagated until the composition of the lab flora remained stable. two lab-specific pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) systems were established and used to monitor the development of the microflora. depending on the prevailing ecological conditions  in the different sourdough fermentations, only a few lactobacillus species were found to be competitive and became dominant. in sourdough a (traditional process  with rye flour), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and a new species, l. mindensis,  were detected. in rye flour sourdoughs b and c, which differed in the process temperature, exclusively l. crispatus and l. pontis became the predominant species in sourdough b and l. crispatus, l. panis, and l. frumenti became the predominant species in sourdough c. on the other hand, in sourdough d (corresponding to sourdough c but produced with rye bran), l. johnsonii and l. reuteri were found. the results of pcr-dgge were consistent with those obtained by culturing, except for sourdough b, in which l. fermentum was also detected. isolates of the species l. sanfranciscensis and l. fermentum were shown by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr analysis to originate from the commercial  starters and the baker's yeast, respectively.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == characterisation and selection of probiotic lactobacilli for a preliminary minipig feeding trial and their effect on serum cholesterol levels, faeces ph and faeces moisture content.
AB  == three out of 297 lactobacillus strains isolated from pig faeces were selected for a feeding trial on account of their high bile-salt hydrolase (bsh) activity, bile-salt resistance, low ph tolerance and the production of antimicrobial substances. two strains were identified as lactobacillus johnsonii and one as lactobacillus reuteri by dna-dna hybridisation. l. johnsoniii bfe 1061 produced a bacteriocin active against a range of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and nonrelated bacteria including clostridium perfringens. six minipigs were maintained on a high-fat, high-cholesterol ('western style') diet for 17 weeks after which the diet was supplemented with the 'probiotic mixture' containing the above mentioned three lactobacillus strains at 2 x 10(12) cfu per pig per day for five weeks. the mixture was given as a resuspended lyophilisate. during a two week follow-up period the minipigs received only the 'western-style' diet without probiotic supplementation. a lowering effect on serum cholesterol levels was indicated after three weeks probiotic feeding, concomitant with an increase in the moisture content of the faeces and lactobacillus cell numbers. triglycerides, ph and number of lactic acid bacteria in faeces were not significantly influenced by probiotic supplementation.
