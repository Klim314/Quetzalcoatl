TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam activity tested against enterobacteriaceae isolates from u.s. hospitals (2011 to 2013) and characterization of beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) inhibited 99.9% (20,698/20,709) of enterobacteriaceae isolates at </=8 mug/ml. this compound was  active against resistant subsets, including ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) phenotype isolates. an esbl phenotype was noted among 12.4% (1,696/13,692 isolates from targeted species) of the isolates, including 776 escherichia coli (12.0% for this species; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 721 klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%; mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), 119 klebsiella oxytoca (10.3%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mug/ml), and 80 proteus mirabilis (4.9%; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml) isolates. the most common enzymes detected among esbl phenotype isolates from 2013 (n = 743) screened using a microarray-based assay were ctx-m-15-like (n = 307), kpc (n = 120), shv esbls (n = 118), and ctx-m-14-like (n = 110). kpc producers were highly resistant to comparators, and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.5/2 mug/ml) and tigecycline (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mug/ml; 98.3% susceptible) were the most active agents against these strains. meropenem (mic50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/ml) and ceftazidime-avibactam (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) were active against ctx-m-producing isolates. other enzymes were also observed, and ceftazidime-avibactam displayed good activity against the isolates producing less common enzymes. among 11 isolates displaying ceftazidime-avibactam mic values of >8 mug/ml, three were k. pneumoniae strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases (all ceftazidime-avibactam mics, >32 mug/ml), with two ndm-1 producers and one k. pneumoniae strain carrying the blakpc-2 and blavim-4 genes. therapeutic options for isolates producing beta-lactamases may be limited, and ceftazidime-avibactam, which displayed good activity against strains, including those producing kpc enzymes, merits further study in infections where such organisms occur.

TI  == carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacteriaceae in taiwan.
AB  == a total of 1135 carbapenem-resistant (nonsusceptible) enterobacteriaceae (cre) isolates were recovered between november 2010 and july 2012 (517 from 2010-2011 and 618 from 2012) from 4 hospitals in taiwan. carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) comprised 5.0% (57 isolates), including 17 kpc-2 (16 klebsiella pneumoniae and 1 escherichia coli), 1 ndm-1 (k. oxytoca), 37 imp-8 (26 enterobacter cloacae, 4 citrobacter freundii, 4 raoultella planticola, 1 k. pneumoniae, 1 e. coli and 1 k. oxytoca), and 2 vim-1 (1 e. cloacae, 1 e. coli). the kpc-2-positive k. pneumoniae were highly clonal even in isolates from different hospitals, and all were st11. imp-8 positive e. cloacae from the same hospitals showed higher similarity in pfge pattern than those from different hospitals. a total of 518 cre isolates (45.6%) were positive for blaesbl, while 704 (62.0%) isolates were blaampc-positive, 382 (33.6% overall) of which carried  both blaesbl and blaampc. ctx-m (414, 80.0%) was the most common blaesbl, while dha (497, 70.6%) and cmy (157, 22.3%) were the most common blaampc. co-carriage of blaesbl and blaampc was detected in 31 (54.4%) and 15 (26.3%) of the 57 cpe, respectively. kpc-2 was the most common carbapenemase detected in k. pneumoniae (2.8%), while imp-8 was the most common in e. cloacae (9.7%). all kpc-2-positive  cre were resistant to all three tested carbapenems. however, fourteen of the 37 imp-8-positive cre were susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem in vitro. intra- and inter-hospital spread of kpc-2-producing k. pneumoniae and imp-8-producing e. cloacae likely occurred. although the prevalence of cpe is still low, careful monitoring is urgently needed. non-susceptibility to ertapenem might need to be considered as one criterion of definition for cre in areas where imp type carbapenemase is prevalent.

TI  == predominance of kpc-3 in a survey for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in portugal.
AB  == among the 2,105 enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 2 enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 tn4401d-blakpc-3, 4 inti3-blages-5, and one inti1-blavim-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. the dissemination of blakpc-3 gene carried by an incf plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae sepsis outcome programme annual report, 2013.
AB  == the australian group on antimicrobial resistance performs regular period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance in selected enteric gram-negative pathogens. the 2013 survey focussed for the first  time on blood stream infections. four thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight enterobacteriaceae species were tested using commercial automated methods (vitek(r) 2, biomerieux; phoenix, bd). the results were analysed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints (january 2014). of the key resistances, non-susceptibility to the third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 7.5%/7.5% (clsi/eucast criteria respectively) of escherichia coli; 6.3%/6.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 7.4%/7.4% of k. oxytoca. non-susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were 10.3%/11.3% for e. coli,  4.6%/7.5% for k. pneumoniae, 0.6%/0.6% for k. oxytoca, and 3.6%/6.1% in enterobacter cloacae. resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 3.1%/6.2%, 4.2%/7.0%, 11.9% /12.6%, and 17.3% /22.2% for the same 4 species respectively. fourteen isolates were shown to harbour a carbapenemase gene, 9 blaimp, 3 blakpc, and 2 blandm.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == genetic analysis of maintenance of pec156, a naturally occurring escherichia coli plasmid that carries genes of the ecoviii restriction-modification system.
AB  == in the present study the role of the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of a  natural plasmid pec156, that carries genes of the ecoviii restriction-modification system was investigated. analysis of this plasmid's genetic content revealed the presence of genetic determinants suggesting two such mechanisms. the first of them relies on site specific recombination utilizing the xer/cer molecular machinery, while the second involves a restriction-modification system as an addiction module. our analysis indicated that three factors affect the maintenance of pec156: (i) a cis-acting cer site involved in resolution of plasmid multimers, (ii) a gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease, and (iii) plasmid copy number control. the lowest stability was observed with pec156 derivatives deprived of the cer site. decreased stability of pec156 derivatives was also observed in e.coli strains deficient in genes coding for proteins involved in plasmid multimer resolution (xerc, xerd, argr and pepa). a similar effect, but to a much lesser extent was observed for the pec156 derivative without a functional  gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease. our results indicate that the presence of the cer site is more important for pec156 stable maintenance than the presence of a functional gene coding for ecoviii endonuclease. in our work we also tested maintenance of pec156 possessing a cole1-type replicon in bacteria belonging to enterobacteriaceae family. we have found that pec156 was most stably maintained in enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca representing coli-type enterobacteria. we have found that in all enterobacteria tested pec156 derivatives deficient in the cer site were significantly less stably maintained than cer(+) variants.

TI  == evaluation of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in an italian setting: report from the trench.
AB  == the spread of carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) has recently become a matter of concern in public health, mainly due to the wide distribution of carbapenemase genes. italy is a country considered endemic for the spread of blakpc klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). the aim of this study was to depict the epidemiological trend of cre in one italian hospital over a long period (3 years  surveillance, from may 2011 to april 2014). based on defined mic cut-off for specific carbapenems, 164 strains isolated from 146 different patients were analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically to establish the resistance genes. molecular typing was performed using the rapd technique. 77 strains were demonstrated to harbor the blakpc gene (73 kp, 4 escherichia coli - ec), 51 strains the blavim gene (44 kp, 3 ec, 2 enterobacter cloacae and 2 klebsiella oxytoca), 8 the blandm gene (3 kp, 4 ec and one providencia stuartii), 3 the blaoxa-48 gene (2 kp, 1 ec), whereas 25 out of the 164 isolates (of different genera and species) had a negative multiplex-pcr amplification for all the targets tested. 39 out of the 164 strains analyzed (23.8%) revealed discrepancies between the mics obtained with automated instrument and gradient mics of more than two logs of difference; the broth microdilution provided a better agreement  with the results obtained with the gradient mic. the use of rapd allowed to distinguish different clusters, closely related, both for blakpc and for blavim kp.

TI  == antimicrobial co-resistance patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated from bloodstream infections: a longitudinal epidemiological study from 2002-2011.
AB  == background: increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacilli (gnb) infections poses a serious threat to public health. few studies have analyzed co-resistance rates, defined as an antimicrobial susceptibility profile in a subset already resistant to one specific antibiotic. the epidemiologic and clinical utility of determining co-resistance rates are analyzed and discussed. methods: a 10-year retrospective study from 2002-2011 of bloodstream infections with gnb were analyzed from three hospitals in greater vancouver, bc, canada. descriptive statistics were calculated for antimicrobial resistance and co-resistance. statistical analysis further described temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance, correlations of resistance between combinations of antimicrobials, and temporal trends in co-resistance patterns. results: the total number of unique blood stream isolates of gnb was 3280. increasing resistance to  individual antimicrobials was observed for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. cloacae, and p. aeruginosa. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli peaked in 2006 at 40% and subsequently stabilized at 29% in 2011, corresponding to decreasing ciprofloxacin usage after 2007, as assessed by defined daily dose utilization data. high co-resistance rates were observed for ceftriaxone-resistant e. coli with ciprofloxacin (73%), ceftriaxone-resistant k. pneumoniae with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83%), ciprofloxacin-resistant e. cloacae with ticarcillin-clavulanate (91%), and piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant p. aeruginosa with ceftazidime (83%). conclusions: increasing antimicrobial resistance was demonstrated over the study period, which may partially be associated with antimicrobial consumption. the study of co-resistance rates in multidrug resistant gnb provides insight into the epidemiology of resistance acquisition, and may be used as a clinical tool to aid prescribing empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == single-molecule sequencing to track plasmid diversity of hospital-associated carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == public health officials have raised concerns that plasmid transfer between enterobacteriaceae species may spread resistance to carbapenems, an antibiotic class of last resort, thereby rendering common health care-associated infections  nearly impossible to treat. to determine the diversity of carbapenemase-encoding  plasmids and assess their mobility among bacterial species, we performed comprehensive surveillance and genomic sequencing of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae in the national institutes of health (nih) clinical center patient population and hospital environment. we isolated a repertoire of carbapenemase-encoding enterobacteriaceae, including multiple strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and pantoea species. long-read genome sequencing with full end-to-end assembly revealed that these organisms carry the carbapenem  resistance genes on a wide array of plasmids. k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae isolated simultaneously from a single patient harbored two different carbapenemase-encoding plasmids, indicating that plasmid transfer between organisms was unlikely within this patient. we did, however, find evidence of horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between k. pneumoniae, e.  cloacae, and c. freundii in the hospital environment. our data, including full plasmid identification, challenge assumptions about horizontal gene transfer events within patients and identify possible connections between patients and the hospital environment. in addition, we identified a new carbapenemase-encoding plasmid of potentially high clinical impact carried by k. pneumoniae, e. coli, e. cloacae, and pantoea species, in unrelated patients and in the hospital environment.

TI  == expansion of esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae in hospitalized patients: a successful story of international clones (st15, st147, st336) and epidemic plasmids (incr, incfiik).
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize by a multi-level approach extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates other than e. coli from portuguese hospitals. eighty-eight esbl-producing clinical isolates (69 klebsiella pneumoniae, 13 enterobacter cloacae complex, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 enterobacter asburiae, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1 serratia marcescens) recovered from hospitals located in the north (a) or centre (b, c) regions during two time periods (2006-7 and 2010) were analyzed. standard methods were used for bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, esbl characterization, clonal (pfge, mlst) and plasmid (s1-pfge, i-ceui-pfge, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis. isolates produced mostly ctx-m-15 (47%) or shv-12 (30%), and less frequently other shv- (15%; shv-2, -5, -28, -55, -106) or  tem- (9%; tem-10, -24, -199)-types, with marked local and temporal variations. the increase of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv esbl-types observed in hospital a was associated with the amplification of multidrug-resistant (mdr) k. pneumoniae epidemic clones (st15, st147, st336). shv-12 and tem-type esbls were mostly identified in diverse isolates of different enterobacteriaceae species in hospitals b and c in 2006-7. particular plasmid types were linked to blactx-m-15  (incr or non-typeable plasmids), blashv-12 (incr or inchi2), blashv-28/-55/-106 (incfiik1 or incfiik5), blatem-10 (incl/m) or blatem-24 (inca/c), mostly in epidemic clones. in our country, the amplification of ctx-m-15 and diverse shv-type esbl among non-e. coli enterobacteriaceae is linked to international mdr k. pneumoniae clones (st15, st147, st336) and plasmid types (incr, incfiik). furthermore, we highlight the potential of incfiik plasmids (here firstly associated with blashv-2/-28/-55/-106) to disseminate as antibiotic resistance plasmids.

TI  == control of an outbreak due to orthopedic infections caused by enterobacteriaceae  producing imp-4 or imp-8 carbapenemases.
AB  == objective: to investigate control of an outbreak due to orthopedic infections caused by enterobacteriaceae producing imp carbapenemases. methods: the sporadic  orthopedic infections with enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemase (cpe) were  retrospectively analyzed in a chinese tertiary care hospital from november 2010 to september 2012. results: the cpe were isolated from four distinct orthopedic patients, three patients infected with enterobacter cloacae while the other with  klebsiella oxytoca. all strains were resistant to almost all the conventional antimicrobial. the strains produced imp-4 type detected in the two early patients, while other strains could produce imp-8 type. all of the four patients  had ever undergoing invasive surgical procedure, and three of them were given fluoroquinolones for anti-infection treatment while the other patients was treated with meropenem. ultimately, all patients were cured and discharged, without outbreak of nosocomial infection caused by cpe. conclusion: our study shows that strict infection control plays an important role in limiting dissemination of enterobacteriaceae producing imp carbapenemase. in addition, reasonable supporting treatment and disinfection protection seems to be more effective for the infection of strains.

AB  == here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), serratia marcescens (n = 14), enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). vim-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by kpc-2 (n = 19), oxa-48 (n = 2) and imp-22 (n = 1). among the k. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (sts) were identified but two clones were dominant: st11 (54/79) containing mainly vim-1-producing isolates; and st101 (13/79) constituted by kpc-2-producing strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) showed a higher  genetic diversity among the remaining enterobacteriaceae. amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in enterobacter spp. an increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among k. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. resistance was focused on st11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. the high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == emergence of carbapenemaseproducing klebsiella pneumoniae of sequence type 258 in michigan, usa.
AB  == the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. we aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. we performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as cpe by positive  modified hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the university of michigan health system (umhs). clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. available cpe isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing of the 16s rrna encoding gene and bla kpc locus. multilocus sequence typing (mlst) was used to characterize klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. twenty six unique cpe isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. the majority were klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). other isolates included k. oxytoca (n=3), citrobacter freundii (n=2), enterobacter cloacae (n=2), enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and escherichia coli (n=1). molecular characterization of 19 available cpe  isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the kpc-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the kpc-2 allele. among 14 available k. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the kpc-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (st) 258. the other  2 (14%) k. pneumoniae isolates carried the kpc-2 allele and belonged to two unique sts. among these st 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. in contrast,  all cpe isolates carrying the kpc-2 allele and all non st 258 cpe isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing k. pneumoniae suggests that kpc-3 producing k. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (st 258), are emerging in our hospital. while st 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the united states, this study is the first to report its presence in michigan.

TI  == characterization of kpc-2-producing escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a chinese hospital.
AB  == twelve nonduplicated kpc-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three escherichia coli, two citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae, four enterobacter aerogenes, and one klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (march 2011 to september 2012). two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by kpc-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with kpc-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. the majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. most isolates  carried bla(ctx-m) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16s rrna methylases (arma or rmtb). the genetic environment of  bla(kpc-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(kpc-2) on the plasmid pkp048, which contains an integration structure of a tn3-based transposon and partial tn4401 segment. inserted fragments (truncated bla(tem)) were detected upstream of the bla(kpc-2) gene for  two e. aerogenes strains. in conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. the outcome of infections caused by kpc-producing enterobacterial isolates and their  mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. the spread of bla(kpc-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in china was  mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the tn3-based transposons and not the bla(kpc-2)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the united states during 2011.
AB  == objectives: during 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) from 19 hospital sites within the united  states. susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. methods: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase esbl (esbl) isolates were determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute's recommended phenotypic test. isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom microscan dehydrated broth microdilution panels esbls and carbapenemases were characterized using the check-points microarray. strain typing of klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-pcr on the diversilab system. results: the majority of isolates were escherichia coli (36%), k. pneumoniae (18.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). incidence of esbl-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics  were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against esbl-positive isolates of e. coli. all other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. against k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against esbl-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically esbl-positive k. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (kpc2 or kpc3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an esbl remained susceptible to ertapenem. conclusions: further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.

TI  == enterobacter and klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in valencia (spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. in this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in enterobacter and klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in valencia, spain). a total of 96  isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 enterobacter isolates (59 e. cloacae, two e. aerogenes, two e. cancerogenus, one  e. gergoviae, and four e. sakazakii, currently cronobacter spp.), and 28 klebsiella isolates (19 k. oxytoca and 9 k. pneumoniae). only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. most isolates were  resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 enterobacter and 16 klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 e. cloacae isolates), four (one e. cloacae and one k. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two e. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. the presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. in addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance  determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == [dissemination of blaimp-8 among enterobacteriaceae isolates from a buenos aires  hospital].
AB  == from august 2008 to december 2011, six metallo-beta-lactamase-producing isolates, four enterobacter cloacae, one klebsiella oxytoca and one citrobacter freundii, were detected at hospital interzonal general de agudos "evita" in lanus. all six  isolates showed multiresistant profiles and the presence of the blaimp-8 gene. five isolates also expressed per-2 extended spectrum beta-lactamase. the blaimp-8 gene was found as the first cassette in a class 1 integron. however, the 3 conserved sequence could not be detected in three isolates. in all cases, blaimp-8 was transferred by conjugation to azide-resistant escherichia coli j53.  pfge analysis revealed that the four e. cloacae isolates were not genetically related. these are the first metallo-beta-lactamases detected in this institution and our results suggest a possible intra- and inter-species horizontal dissemination of blaimp-8.

TI  == high prevalence of vim-4 and ndm-1 metallo-beta-lactamase among carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms leading to carbapenem resistance among multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections in mubarak al kabeer hospital, kuwait. fourteen carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained from inpatients in different wards and intensive care units between april 2009 and february 2011. antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using the e-test method. genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by specific pcr amplification, sequencing and conjugation assays. all isolates were identified as metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producers using phenotypic and molecular methods. eleven of the 14 isolates produced vim-4 (six klebsiella pneumoniae, three escherichia coli, one enterobacter cloacae and one klebsiella oxytoca). three k.  pneumoniae isolates produced the mbl ndm-1 and co-produced the plasmid-encoded ampc cmy-4. the vim-4-producing isolates co-produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases including ctx-m-15 and some shv derivatives. the vim-4 gene was not transferable by conjugation studies of six selected strains. we demonstrated  here the emergence of vim-4- and ndm-1-producing isolates in the largest teaching hospital in kuwait.

TI  == distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the asia-pacific region: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == the increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections  (iai) from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the asia-pacific region were investigated. detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), ampc beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex pcr. a total of 699 enterobacteriaceae  isolates with positive genotypic results, included escherichia coli (n = 443), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), citrobacter freundii (n = 5), proteus mirabilis (n = 3), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of enterobacter asburiae, proteus vulgaris, and providencia rettgeri were analyzed.  nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated iai. ctx-m (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with ctx-m-15) was the most common esbl, followed by shv (n = 59) and tem (n = 4). cmy (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with cmy-2) was the most common ampc beta-lactamase, followed by dha (n = 46) and act/mir (n = 40). ndm (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with ndm-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by imp (n = 7) and oxa (n = 7). isolates from hospital-associated iai had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in enterobacteriaceae isolates from  india, except that imp beta-lactamases were also detected in philippines and australia. ctx-m beta-lactamases were the predominant esbls produced by enterobacteriaceae causing iai in the asia-pacific region. emergence of ctx-m-15-, cmy-2-, and ndm-1-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in first febrile urinary tract infection affect breakthrough  infections in infants with vesicoureteral reflux treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in infants with vesicoureteral reflux (vur) and whether bacterial pathogen affected breakthrough uti or not. methods: we compared children with infantile vur with recurrent uti (33 males, 11 females, mean age 3.2 months) and without recurrent uti (40 males, 7 females, mean age 4.8 months). the following were compared between the 2 groups: sex, timing of uti episode, bacterial growth on urine culture, degree and bilaterality of the reflux, hydronephrosis, renal scar, and delayed ureteral excretion of refluxed contrast on voiding cystourethrogram (vcug). results: univariate cox survival-time regression showed that younger age  at first uti, a non-escherichia coli strain, bilateral and vur, high-grade vur, and hydronephrosis on initial ultrasonography (usg) significantly increased the risks of recurrent uti (p <.05 each). in multivariate analysis, timing of the uti episode (p = .015), a non-e. coli strain (p = .003), high grade (p = .012), and bilateral vur (p = .002) were independently associated with increased risk of recurrent uti. non-e. coli strains were identified in 60% and 33% of infants with and without recurrent uti, respectively. conclusion: during the first year of life, the earlier the first uti then the higher the chance is for recurrent utis. higher grades of reflux, bilateral vur, and the first infection by a non-e. coli  strain all significantly increase the risk of recurrent utis.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == diversity of bacteria nesting the plant cover of north sinai deserts, egypt.
AB  == north sinai deserts were surveyed for the predominant plant cover and for the culturable bacteria nesting their roots and shoots. among 43 plant species reported, 13 are perennial (e.g. fagonia spp., pancratium spp.) and 30 annuals (e.g. bromus spp., erodium spp.). eleven species possessed rhizo-sheath, e.g. cyperus capitatus, panicum turgidum and trisetaria koelerioides. microbiological  analyses demonstrated: the great diversity and richness of associated culturable  bacteria, in particular nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs); the majority of bacterial residents were of true and/or putative diazotrophic nature; the bacterial populations followed an increasing density gradient towards the root surfaces; sizeable populations were able to reside inside the root (endorhizosphere) and shoot (endophyllosphere) tissues. three hundred bacterial isolates were secured from studied spheres. the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacilli isolates belonged to bacillus megaterium, bacillus pumilus, bacillus polymexa, bacillus macerans, bacillus circulans and bacillus licheniformis. the family enterobacteriaceae represented by enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter sackazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia adorifera, serratia liquefaciens and klebsiella oxytoca. the non-enterobacteriaceae population was rich in pantoae spp., agrobacterium rdiobacter, pseudomonas vesicularis, pseudomonas putida, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, ochrobactrum anthropi, sphingomonas paucimobilis and chrysemonas luteola. gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus were reported inside root and shoot tissues of a number of tested plants. the dense bacterial populations reported speak well to the very possible significant role played by the endophytic bacterial populations in the survival, in respect of nutrition and health, of existing plants. such groups of diazotrophs are good candidates, as bio-preparates, to support the growth of future field crops grown in deserts of north sinai and irrigated by the water of el-salam canal.

TI  == artemisia capillaris extracts as a green factory for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles with antibacterial activities.
AB  == we report a green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that uses extracts from the aerial part of artemisia capillaris. both water and 70% ethanol extracts successfully generated silver nanoparticles. the formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance bands, fourier transform-infrared spectra, high resolution-transmission electron and atomic force microscopic images. various shapes of silver nanoparticles were generated with an average diameter of 29.71 nm with water extract and 29.62 nm with 70% ethanol extract. an improvement in antibacterial activity (mic 8.35-16.7 microg/ml) was observed against a total of twenty different strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. a remarkable enhancement (approximately 12-fold) was observed against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, and klebsiella areogenes when compared  with the extract alone. silver nanoparticles produced by the 70% ethanol extract  showed slightly higher antibacterial activity than those generated with the water extract. the correlation between total flavonoid content of each extract and the  antibacterial activity did not exert any significant relationships. this report suggests that plant extracts have the potential to be used as powerful reducing agents for the production of biocompatible silver nanoparticles possessing enhanced antibacterial activities.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == volatile compound profiling for the identification of gram-negative bacteria by ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry.
AB  == aims: fast and reliable methods for the early detection and identification of micro-organism are of high interest. in addition to established methods, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile compounds (vcs) emitted by micro-organisms has recently been shown to allow species differentiation. thus, a large number of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, which comprised acinetobacter  baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and serratia marcescens, were subjected  to headspace vc composition analysis using direct mass spectrometry in a low sample volume that allows for automation. methods and results: ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry (imr-ms) was applied to headspace analysis of the above bacterial samples incubated at 37 degrees c starting with 10(2) cfu ml(-1)  . measurements of sample vc composition were performed at 4, 8 and 24 h. microbial growth was detected in all samples after 8 h. after 24 h, species-specific mass spectra were obtained allowing differentiation between bacterial species. conclusions: imr-ms provided rapid growth detection and identification of micro-organisms using a cumulative end-point model with a short analysis time of 3 min per sample. significance and impact of the study: following further validation, the presented method of bacterial sample headspace  vc analysis has the potential to be used for bacteria differentiation.

TI  == characterization and purification of a bacteriocin from lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bmk2005, an intestinal isolate active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == a strain of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bmk2005 isolated from healthy infant faeces has shown a remarkable antibacterial activity against 32 bacterial pathogenic strains of human clinical isolates. among them, 13 strains belonging to species of escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx) and ceftazidime (caz), and 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). this antibacterial activity was attributed to a bacteriocin designated as paracaseicin a. it was heat-stable up to 120 degrees c for 5 min and active within the ph range of 2-5.  its activity was lost when treated with proteases, which reveals its proteinaceous nature. this bacteriocin was successfully purified only by two steps of reversed phase chromatography. its molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry analysis, was 2,462.5 da. to our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and purification of a bacteriocin, produced by a l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strain exhibiting an antibacterial activity against various multidrug-resistant species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant species especially in cases of antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad).

TI  == complications of port-a-cath(r) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  == background: red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (scd). however, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (cvcs) in adult patients with moderate or severe scd. aims: to review our experience with the use of the port-a-cath((r)) device in sixteen patients with scd undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. methods: among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen scd  patients required the insertion of a port-a-cath((r)) device. these patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- sd]. a  total of 24 port-a-cath((r)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. results: out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. the organisms involved were candida spp. (3), c. parapsilosis (2), c. albicans (1), c. famata (1), c. lusitanice (1), staphylococcus spp. (6), and s. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (1), diphtheroid bacilli (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), ps. spp. (3), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), klebsiella spp. (1), serratia liquefaciens (1), serratia fanticola (1), achromobacter spp. (2) chromobacterium violaceum (1), delftia acidovirans (1), stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), alcaligenes faecalis (1), and enterobacter cloacae (1). two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. one case presented with right atrial thrombosis/svc syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. the median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). the rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. discussion: our results suggest that patients with scd suffer infective complications associated  with the port-a-cath((r)), which often necessitate its removal. although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.

TI  == influence of consumption of probiotics on presence of enterobacteria in the oral  cavity.
AB  == clinical benefits of probiotics have been clearly reported in different gastrointestinal disorders, many of them caused by enterobacteria. the oral cavity is a port of entry and can be an important reservoir of these microorganisms. this work evaluated whether consumption of probiotics was able to influence the presence of enterobacteria in the oral cavity and the specific secretory response against these microorganisms. saliva samples of healthy individuals were collected and plated in macconkey agar. carriers of gram-negative, rod-shaped microorganisms in the oral cavity were selected and instructed to use the probiotic yakult lb for 20 days. saliva was then collected  and enterobacteria species were identified using the api 20 e system and by elisa using anti-enterobacteria iga. the results showed reduction in the prevalence of  enterobacteria, but no significant changes in enterobacterial counts (log cfu/ml; p = 0.3457). the species most frequently isolated were enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, both before and after probiotic consumption. no significant changes were observed in anti-enterobacteria iga levels. in conclusion, probiotic consumption had some influence on enterobacterial presence in the oral cavity, but did not affect enterobacterial counts or the specific immune secretory response against them.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [validity of using imipenem as a representative carbapenems and levofloxacin as a representative fluoroquinolones in antibiotics susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == in antimicrobial susceptibility test for enterobacteriaceae, the efficacies of carpapenems are predicted by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of imipenem, and that of fluoroquinolones are predicted by the mic of levofloxacin.  to assess its judgement, we compared the mics of imipenem, meropenem, panipenem,  and doripenem for carbapenems, and ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tosufloxacin and  pazufloxacin for fluoroquinolones of clinically isolated enterobacteria, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacterfreundii, those resistant to the third generation cephalosporin. mic distributions in low concentration range are estranged in some strains, conspicuously s. marcescens, e. cloacae and c. freundii: meropenem and doripenem displayed low mic value than imipenem and panipenem. since the estrangements are appeared mic value of less than 8 microg/ml, the interpretive results (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) are not affected. in fluoroquinolones, all 4 agents showed almost identical mic distributions, thus the mic of levofloxacin is accepted to use the reference for  other fluoroquinolones. the existence of the strains harboring carbapenem-resistant gene displaying low mic value of carbapenems was reported. for the sensitive detection of the candidate of carbapenem-resistant strains, cut-off value of each carbapenem should be reconsidered, and also other phonotype analysis should be applied. genomic analysis also would be required to detect the carbapenem-resistant gene.

TI  == population dynamics of bacteria associated with different strains of the pine wood nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus after inoculation in maritime pine (pinus pinaster).
AB  == for a long time it was thought that bursaphelenchus xylophilus was the only agent of the pine wilt disease. recently, it was discovered that there are bacteria associated with the nematodes that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease, mainly through the release of toxins that promote the death of the pines. among the species most commonly found, are bacteria belonging to the bacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas and xanthomonas genera. the main objective of this work was to study the effect of inoculation of maritime pine (pinus pinaster) with four different nematode isolates, in the bacterial population of nematodes and trees, at different stages of disease progression. the monitoring of progression of disease symptoms was also recorded. also, the identification of bacteria isolated from the xylem of trees and the surface of nematodes was performed by classical identification methods, by the api20e identification system and by sequencing of bacterial dna. the results showed that for the symptoms progression, the most striking difference was observed for the pines inoculated with the avirulent isolate, c14-5, which led to a slower and less severe aggravation of symptoms than in pines inoculated with the virulent isolates. in general, it was found that bacterial population, inside the tree, increased with disease progression. a superior bacterial quantity was isolated from pines inoculated with the nematode isolates hf and 20, and, comparatively, few bacteria were isolated from pines inoculated with the avirulent isolate. the  identification system api20e was insufficient in the identification of bacterial  species; enterobacter cloacae species was identified in 79% of the isolated bacterial colonies and seven of these colonies could not be identified by this method. molecular identification methods, through bacterial dna sequencing, allowed a more reliable identification: eleven different bacterial species within the bacillus, citrobacter, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, paenibacillus,  pantoea and terribacillus genera were identified. general bacterial diversity increased with the progression of the disease. bacillus spp. were predominant at  the earlier stage of disease progression and klebsiella oxytoca at the later stages. furthermore, bacterial species isolated from the surface of nematodes were similar to those isolated from the xylem of pines. in the present work new bacterial species were identified which have never been reported before in this type of study and may be associated with their geographical origin (portugal). p. pinaster, the pine species used in this study, was different from those commonly  grown in japan and china. furthermore, it was the first time that bacteria were isolated and identified from an avirulent pine wood nematode isolate.

TI  == intra- and inter-species spread of carbapenemase genes in a non-hospitalized patient.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to report intra- and inter-species spread of carbapenemase genes between gram negative rods isolated from a non-hospitalized patient with bacteremia. the approach included chart review, antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic screening for metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)  detection, pcr and sequencing of bla, aac(6')-ib and qnr genes, and plasmid analysis by pcr-based replicon typing. the clonal relationships between the isolates were analysed by comparing pfge profiles. a non-hospitalized patient presented bacteraemia due to wild type enterobacter cloacae (4.08), a vim-1-producing e. cloacae (5.08), a vim-1- and ctx-m-9-producing e. cloacae (7.08), a vim-2-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa, and catheter colonization by vim-1-producing klebsiella oxytoca. the patient had no previous hospitalization but had recently undergone an ambulatory colonoscopy. in e. cloacae 7.08 and k. oxytoca isolates, the bla(vim-1) gene was located on a transferable plasmid of 48.5 kb, while in e. cloacae 5.08 the bla(vim-1) gene was encoded on a 194 kb non-transferable plasmid. the bla(ctx-m-9) gene detected in e. cloacae was encoded on an hi2 plasmid of 290 kb. to date the prevalence of vim-1 enzymes in the community is low. this molecular finding suggests an intra-species and/or inter-species horizontal spread of the mbl gene in the same non-hospitalized patient.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae oral isolates from brazilian hiv-positive patients. correlation with cd4 cell counts and viral load.
AB  == the aim was to evaluate the presence of staphylococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae in the oral cavities of hiv-positive patients. forty-five individuals diagnosed as hiv-positive by elisa and western-blot, and under anti-retroviral therapy for at least 1 year, were included in the study. the control group constituted 45 systemically healthy individuals matched to the hiv  patients to gender, age and oral conditions. oral rinses were collected and isolates were identified by api system. counts of microorganisms from hiv and control groups were compared statistically by a mann-whitney test (alpha=5%). the percentages of individuals positive for staphylococci were similar between the groups (p=0.764), whereas for gram-negative rods, a higher percentage was observed amongst hiv-positive (p=0.001). there was no difference in staphylococcus counts between hiv and control groups (p=0.1008). counts were lower in the oral cavities of patients with low viral load (p=0.021), and no difference was observed in relation to cd4 counts (p=0.929). staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species in hiv group, and staphylococcus  epidermidis was the prevalent species in the control group. significantly higher  numbers of enteric bacteria and pseudomonas were detected in the oral cavities of the hiv group than in the control (p=0.0001). enterobacter cloacae was the most frequently isolated species in both groups. counts of enteric bacteria and pseudomonas were significantly lower in patients with low cd4 counts (p=0.011); however, there was no difference relating to viral load. it may be concluded that hiv group showed greater species diversity and a higher prevalence of enterobacteriaceae/pseudomonadaceae.

TI  == molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria  isolated from bovine mastitis in egypt.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis cases in egypt. multidrug resistance phenotypes were found in 34 of 112 (30.4%) gram-negative bacterial isolates, which harbored at least one antimicrobial resistance gene. the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (mdr) species were enterobacter cloacae (8 isolates, 7.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 6.3%), klebsiella oxytoca (7 isolates, 6.3%), escherichia coli (5 isolates, 4.5%), and citrobacter freundii (3 isolates, 2.7%). the most commonly observed resistance phenotypes were against ampicillin (97.0%), streptomycin (94.1%), tetracycline (91.2%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (88.2%), nalidixic acid (85.3%), and chloramphenicol (76.5%). class 1 integrons were detected in 28 (25.0%) isolates. the gene cassettes within class 1 integrons included those encoding resistance to trimethoprim (dfra1, dfra5, dfra7, dfra12, dfra15, dfra17, and dfra25), aminoglycosides (aada1, aada2, aada5, aada7, aada12, aada22, and aac(3)-id), chloramphenicol (cmla), erythromycin (erea2), and rifampicin (arr-3). class 2 integrons were identified in 6 isolates (5.4%) with three different profiles. furthermore, the beta-lactamase encoding genes, bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(ctx-m), and bla(oxa), the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr, and the florfenicol resistance gene, flor, were also identified. to the best of our knowledge, the results identified class 2 integrons, qnr and aac(6)-ib-cr from cases of mastitis for the first time. this is the first report of molecular characterization for antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria isolated from bovine mastitis in africa.

TI  == is selective digestive decontamination useful in controlling aerobic gram-negative bacilli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases?
AB  == aims: to identify outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection due to extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing aerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb-esbl); to establish whether agnb-esbl, sensitive to tobramycin, become resistant over time; and to evaluate the impact of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (sdd) on abnormal carriage of agnb-esbl. design and setting:  all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (picu) over a 12-month period had biweekly surveillance cultures of throat and rectum and diagnostic cultures when clinically indicated. all agnb were tested for esbl, and the positive isolates were sent for molecular typing. the picu uses sdd (parenteral cefotaxime and enteral polymyxin e/tobramycin) to control abnormal carriage. patients who had at least one agnb-esbl were included in the study. results: during the study period, 1,101 children were admitted to the picu. there were 39  patients (3.5%) with a total of 236 cultures positive for agnb-esbl. twenty-eight patients (2.5%) were carriers, and 11 (1%) had proven infections. organisms isolated from the first culture were 14 patients with klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 with enterobacter cloacae, 7 with citrobacter freundii, 5 with klebsiella oxytoca, and 5 with escherichia coli. in the first sample, 59% of isolates showed tobramycin resistance. molecular typing confirmed that there were five different  strains of k. pneumoniae and that similar strains were not isolated in the same period. conclusions: sdd is an effective measure to control agnb-esbl and to avoid outbreak episodes of either carriage or infection. when tobramycin resistance is found, replacing it with another aminoglycoside based on antibiogram may be more effective in achieving agnb clearance.

TI  == [clinical assessment of novel chromid esbl agar plates for detection of esbl producers in the family enterobacteriaceae].
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers in the family enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. chromid esbl agar newly developed for screening esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae was released in japan in april, 2007. we evaluated the clinical assessment of chromid esbl agar in routine microbiology laboratory. the 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae with the mics of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. the 27 esbl-producers examined were comprising of 19 escherichia coli, 3 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 citrobacter freundii, 3 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 s. marcescens (esbl group) and 20 esbl non-producers  consiating of 5 k. oxytoca, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 p. vlugaris, 2 serratia marcescens, 8 c. freundii, 2 enterobacter cloacae, and 1 e. aerogenes (non-esbl group). characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. as the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of chromid esbl agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. it should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. these findings clearly suggested that in  cases of utilizing chromid esbl agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the esbl-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to cpdx.

TI  == volatiles emitted from eight wound-isolated bacteria differentially attract gravid screwworms (diptera: calliphoridae) to oviposit.
AB  == bovine blood inoculated with bacteria isolated from screwworm [cochliomyia hominivorax (coquerel) (diptera: calliphoridae)]-infested animal wounds was tested as an attractant for oviposition for gravid screwworms. eight species of gram-negative coliform (enterobacteriaceae) bacteria mixed with bovine blood singly or all species combined and incubated for various times produced volatiles that attracted gravid flies in a cage bioassay in varying numbers. in 15-min duration tests, volatiles from five species of bacteria (klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii) attracted more females than volatiles of the three species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter sakazakii, and serratia liquefaciens). in 1-h duration oviposition tests, volatiles from the substrate using the same five species of bacteria attracted more females to oviposit than the other three species. volatiles from 24-h incubation period elicited least attraction and oviposition whereas volatiles from the 48- and 72-h incubation period resulted in significantly more attraction and oviposition. attraction and oviposition decreased significantly when the substrates were incubated for 96 h. volatiles from substrate with all species of bacteria combined attracted a significantly higher percentage of flies to land and oviposit than those from substrates prepared with single species. it is possible that multiple active chemicals present in volatiles of the all-species substrate may act as synergists resulting in greater response than those observed with volatiles from single-species substrate. before oviposition flies took a bloodmeal from the oviposition substrate. it is possible that the oviposition is moderated by two different factors in screwworm-first, by using a chemical cue to land on a potential oviposition site and second, by using a bloodmeal to stimulate oviposition.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

TI  == influencing factors in the occurrence of injured coliforms in the drinking water  distribution system in the city of la plata, argentina.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the influencing factors in the occurrence of coliforms in the drinking water in la plata (argentina) from june 1999 to june 2001. a total of 180 samples were collected from rio de la plata (102 samples) and puelche aquifer (78 samples); 45 samples were collected for each of the four seasons. the membrane filter procedure was used for isolating bacteria, and each sample was tested for chlorine and ph. the highest percentage  of samples positive for coliforms in the two tested media was obtained in summer  while the highest percentage of negative samples was obtained in winter. no escherichia coli was isolated. the percentage of injured coliforms fluctuated between 70 and 100%. the most frequently isolated bacteria was enterobacter cloacae in summer, enterobacter agglomerans in autumn and klebsiella oxytoca in winter and spring. significant correlations were observed between coliforms and the distance from the initial treatment point, and with the level of free chlorine. we conclude that drinking water contamination in la plata occurs in the distribution system due to increased temperatures and reduced disinfectant levels, which result in bacterial regrowth.

TI  == performance of vitek-2 compact and overnight microscan panels for direct identification and susceptibility testing of gram-negative bacilli from positive  fan bact/alert blood culture bottles.
AB  == we describe the reliability of the vitek-2 compact and overnight microscan panels for direct identification and susceptibility testing from the bact/alert blood culture system when using fan (fa and fn) bottles. a simple procedure, in two centrifugation steps, was designed to remove the charcoal particles present in fa and fn bottles. a total of 113 positive blood cultures showing gram-negative rods were investigated. enterobacteriaceae were isolated in 104 cases, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in nine. the microscan system correctly identified 106 (93.8%) of the  113 isolates. the seven identificaction errors included p. aeruginosa (three), enterobacter cloacae (one), escherichia coli (one), klebsiella oxytoca (one), and klebsiella pneumoniae (one). the vitek-2 system correctly identified 109 (96.5%)  of the 113 samples obtained directly from the blood culture bottles. the four unidentified isolates were enterobacter cloacae (two), escherichia coli (one), and p. aeruginosa (one). microscan yielded 4/779 (0.5%) very major errors and 28/2825 (0.9%) minor errors. vitek-2 yielded 2/550 (0.36%) very major errors, 1/1718 (0.05%) major error, and 32/2373 (1.3%) minor errors. both systems provided excellent identification (correlation of >90%) and susceptibility (correlation of >98%) results. the average times required to obtain identification and susceptibility results using the direct test applied to the vitek-2 compact system were 4.57 +/- 1.37 h and 6.52 +/- 1.64 h, respectively. the vitek-2 compact system provided results on the same day that the blood culture was found to be positive.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  == objective: to determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. study design: we isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed  infants, identified using pcr with species-specific primers, strain-specific automated ribotyping and the api-50e kit for enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. results: coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) cfu/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) cfu/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes and enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. the counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for e. coli: median 6.30 log(10) cfu/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) cfu/g  faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. conclusions: this is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. coliform bacteria, particularly escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == can we rely on one laboratory test in detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae? an evaluation of the vitek 2 system and comparison with four other detection methods in kuwait.
AB  == background and aims: clinical hospitals need to correctly identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria in infected patients to correctly treat the patient and avoid spreading antibiotic resistance. kuwaiti hospitals use one laboratory test for detecting esbl bacteria. this study evaluated whether that was sufficient to detect esbl bacteria, and compared the vitek system with other detection systems. methods: (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, k oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from five different kuwaiti main hospitals, all of which were flagged as esbl-positive by the vitek 2 system. the isolates were retested by the vitek 2 system, and were also tested by double disc diffusion (ddd), the disc approximation test, the e-test and the microscan system for the detection of esbls. results: retesting with the vitek system revealed 100% compatibility with the results of the source  hospitals. the microscan system, ddd, disc approximation test and e-test could detect esbl in 199, 192, 178 and 205 isolates, respectively. conclusions: technically, the microscan and vitek 2 systems were the least demanding method to detect esbl as it is an integral part of the routine susceptibility test card. e-test strips were reliable but the most expensive of all techniques used. the ddd test and disc approximation, while relatively inexpensive, were technically subjective. the vitek system may be very suitable in clinical laboratories, but would be better if accompanied with another test for detection of esbl bacteria.

TI  == clinical experience of serious infections caused by enterobacteriaceae producing  vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a greek university hospital.
AB  == background: the dissemination of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) in members of the family enterobacteriaceae is regarded as an emerging clinical threat. the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to mbl-producing isolates were analyzed. methods: during a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an mbl-producing strain  belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. we screened for mbl production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. results: fourteen cases of bacteremia and  3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an mbl-producing isolate were studied. most of the patients had previously been colonized with an mbl-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. the isolated pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to >32 microg/ml) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(vim-1) cluster in all isolates. among the 12 k. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have  failed. twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. the attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. conclusions: mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the mic of carbapenems. colonization with an mbl-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria.

TI  == complex clonal and plasmid epidemiology in the first outbreak of enterobacteriaceae infection involving vim-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in spain: toward endemicity?
AB  == background: we report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls)  among enterobacterial isolates at ramon y cajal university hospital (madrid, spain). methods and results: during the period from march 2005 through september  2006, 25 patients (52% of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different mbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates (klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients;  escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). clonal analysis (xbai pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all k. pneumoniae  isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the e. cloacae isolates. carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, < or = 1 to > 8 microg/ml), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. the bla(vim-1) mbl gene was present in all isolates; in addition,  the bla(shv-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-dfrii-aada1-catb2) in k. pneumoniae and e. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(vim-1)-aaca4-aada1) in e. cloacae and  k. oxytoca isolates. the bla(vim-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 k. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 e. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 e. coli isolate. a 60-kb plasmid belonging to the inci1 group was detected in the epidemic vim-1-k. pneumoniae clone. plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to inch12 group were found among e. cloacae isolates. conclusions: k. pneumoniae-mbl monoclonal epidemics coexisted with e. cloacae-mbl multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. the spread of the bla(vim-1) gene among enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class i integron platforms. such complex epidemiology might anticipate endemicity and should be considered for the design of containment epidemiology strategies.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the united states between 1993 and 2004.
AB  == during the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care  unit (icu) patients in united states hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. mics for 12 different agents were  determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. the 11 organisms most frequently isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), escherichia coli (18.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), serratia marcescens (5.5%), enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), proteus mirabilis (4.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and citrobacter freundii (2.0%). specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. e. coli and p. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with acinetobacter spp. rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study  period for most species. ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (acinetobacter spp., c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens) became more susceptible. the prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among icu isolates of acinetobacter spp., p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae.

TI  == detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  == three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the phoenix automated microbiology system (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md), the vitek 2 system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france), and the microscan walkaway-96 system (dade behring, inc., west sacramento, ca), using routine testing panels. one hundred fifty putative esbl producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the clsi double-disk synergy test, and the etest esbl were also evaluated. biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. one hundred forty-seven isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were investigated. of these  isolates, 85 were identified as esbl producers by the reference method. the remaining isolates were identified as non-esbl producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal ampc, koxy, or shv enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. the system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of esbls was the phoenix (99%), followed by the vitek 2 (86%) and the microscan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (phoenix) to 78% (vitek 2). the performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. the sensitivities of the conventional test  methods ranged from 93 to 94%. the double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.

TI  == [development of beta-lactamase resistance in enterobacteria].
AB  == enterobacteria produce elementary chromosomal enzymes, beta-lactamases of class a: tem and shv (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). these can give rise to  plasmid-coded broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) discovered in 1980 (e. coli,  k. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae). the first cefotaximase (ctx-m, men-1) was reported in europe in 1990. this enzyme is far more active against cefotaxime than against ceftazidime and aztreonam. chromosomal hyperpoduction of k1 beta-lactamase differs from all other esbls due its sensitivity to ceftazidime (klebsiella oxytoca). however, not all enterobacteria are resistant only because  of esbls, but also as a result of the action of chromosomally or plasmid coded ampc beta-lactamase of class c (mir-1, cmy-1, bil-1, fox-1, mox-1, dha-1, acc-1), resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors and to cefoxitin (enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, morganelle spp., serratia spp.). with the loss of outside-membrane porins (omp) they can become resistant to carbapenem an  tibiotics. the 100% resistance of enterobacteria to carbapenems that so far exists in this country is elsewhere in the world compromised by the incidence of  carbapenem-hydrolysing plasmid-determined beta-lactamase of class b (imp-1, vim-1) and of class a (kpc-1) in k. pneumoniae, (sme-1) in serratia marcescens and (imi-1, nmc-a) in e. clocae. carbapenemases in enterobacteria are only effective in the presence of impermeability and other resistance mechanisms.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

AB  == bacteria harbouring the novel qnra plasmid-mediated mechanism of quinolone resistance have been described in different countries, but the frequency of their occurrence has not been investigated. in total, 1,468 clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae with quinolone resistance or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl) phenotypes were collected from eight teaching hospitals in france during 2002-2005 and screened for qnra. overall, 28 isolates (22 enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella pneumoniae, one citrobacter freundii, one klebsiella oxytoca and one proteus mirabilis) were positive for qnra, representing 1.9% of all isolates, 3.3% of esbl-producing isolates (22% of the e. cloacae isolates) and 0% of non-esbl-producing isolates. the prevalence of qnra among consecutive esbl-producing isolates in 2004 from the eight hospitals was 2.8% (18/639). of the qnra-positive isolates, 100% were intermediately-resistant or resistant to nalidixic acid, and 75% to ciprofloxacin. twenty-one of the 22 qnra-positive e. cloacae isolates were obtained from two hospitals in the paris area, and molecular typing and plasmid content analysis showed clonal relationships for five, three and two isolates, respectively. the qnra genetic environment was similar to that of the in36 integron. the remaining two isolates had qnra variants (30 and 29 nucleotide differences, respectively, compared with the original sequence) and an unknown genetic environment. the esbl gene associated with qnra was bla(shv-12) in most of the isolates, but bla(per-1) and bla(shv-2a) were found in two isolates. in france, it appears that qnra-positive isolates are predominantly e. cloacae isolates producing shv-12, and may be associated with the dissemination of an in36-like integron.

AB  == two hundred and fifty-one unique patient isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (123), escherichia coli (114), klebsiella oxytoca (7), enterobacter cloacae (5) and citrobacter freundii (2), flagged as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive by the vitek system (gns-526 card), were collected. these strains were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of the royal infirmary of edinburgh (rie), edinburgh, uk (and associated gp practices), hairmyers hospital, glasgow, uk, and the amiri  and farwania hospitals, kuwait. of the 101 rie strains tested, 15 e. coli strains were found to be esbl negative by etest esbl strips. on retesting the 15 e. coli  strains with the vitek gns-532 card, 14 were found to be esbl negative, despite being originally flagged as esbl positive. the remaining 236 esbl-producing strains were also subjected to the double disc-diffusion (ddd) technique for the  detection of esbls. of these, two were false negatives by etest esbl test strips  (using both cefotaxime and ceftazidime strips), and 38 were false negatives by the ddd method. the etest false-negative esbl-producing strains of k. pneumoniae  were positive by ddd. technically, the vitek method was the least demanding method to perform, as it was an integral part of the routine susceptibility test  card. etest strips were reliable, but were the most expensive of all the techniques used. the ddd test, while relatively inexpensive, was technically subjective, and in our hands, seven of the esbl-positive strains that were confirmed by the other two techniques were not detected. despite the false-positive esbl-producing e. coli strains, the vitek susceptibility card with its integral esbl test offers the clinical laboratory a valuable and quick option to screen for esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and e. coli as part of the routine laboratory methodology.

AB  == background: in march 2004, the chicago department of public health was notified of a cluster of bloodstream infections with klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae at a chemotherapy center. our purpose was to identify the source of the outbreak and prevent further cases. methods: the investigation included 103 oncology patients seen at an outpatient oncology chemotherapy center in chicago during the 16 days before its closure. the outbreak investigation included case identification, retrospective cohort study, review of medical records, microbiologic testing of blood specimens, environmental cultures, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the main outcome measure was infection with k oxytoca, e cloacae, or both, and the mantel-haenszel chi(2) test was used to assess risk of infection in relation to presence of central venous catheter. results: among the 103 patients, risk of infection was associated with the presence of central venous catheter (relative risk undefined, p<.001). twenty-seven patients had blood cultures that grew k oxytoca, e cloacae, or both, and all had central venous catheters that were flushed with isotonic sodium chloride solution at the clinic from february 17 through march 3, 2004. isolates  of k oxytoca and e cloacae were matched by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to k  oxytoca and e cloacae isolates obtained from multiple predrawn syringes and from  the intravenous fluid and administration set in use in the clinic at the time of  its closing. conclusions: the injection of contaminated isotonic sodium chloride  solution through the venous catheters of attendees at the clinic likely provided  the opportunity for bloodstream infections in these 27 case patients. this outbreak highlights the need for continued emphasis on safe injection practices and suggests the need for guidelines and recommendations tailored to outpatient settings.

TI  == gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == objective: bloodstream infections caused by gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. this study describes the species of gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. design: interventional study. setting: two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. patients: neonates hospitalized for >or  =24 hrs. interventions: prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from march 2001 to january 2003. hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. measurements and main results: there were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by gram-negative bacilli. among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). eleven and 24 gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. the most common gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), escherichia coli (21.2%), enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and serratia marcescens (11.2%). in contrast, acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), k. pneumoniae (11.7%), e. cloacae (10.6%), k. oxytoca (10.6%), and pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae,  and e. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). resistance patterns were similar between gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among  neonatal isolates of k. pneumoniae (p < .05). conclusions: gram-negative bacilli  species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.

TI  == [urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. the aim of this study was to compare the incidence of utis during two  different time periods (from february 1999 to march 2000, and from april 2000 to  september 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. the frequency of occurrence of esbl--producing gram-negative rods increased during second period study. the isolated esbl--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms.  isolated organisms from urine samples included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus penneri, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundi, serratia spp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, cns, enterococcus spp. streptococcus spp, and candida spp. enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. only 9.4% of isolated enterococcus spp. were high-level  aminoglicoside resistant (hlar) strains. no vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. were isolated. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) methicillin resistant strains (mrcns) were isolated in 43.3%.

TI  == evaluation of a new screen agar plate for detection and presumptive identification of enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == a new agar screen plate for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) detection was evaluated with 50 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species: enterobacter cloacae (n = 10), escherichia coli (n = 10), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 25), and proteus mirabilis (n = 2). fecal samples  were artificially inoculated with 2 concentrations (25 and 250 colony forming units [cfu]/plate) of the test strains and then applied to the new agar screen plates. by this approach, the new agar formula detected growth that was suggestive of esbl activity in 44 of 50 (88%) and 50 of 50 (100%) of esbl strains with 25 and 250 cfu/plate, respectively. a limitation of the agar screen plates was a lack of some specificity. among 15 strains with resistant phenotypes other  than esbl (k1 producers of k. oxytoca, 6 strains; 9 strains with ampc phenotype), growth was recorded in 7 (25 cfu/plate) and 11 (250 cfu/plate) of 15 strains. in  conclusion, the new agar screen plate is a sensitive and convenient method to directly screen for esbl organisms in rectal swabs or stool samples, with the potential for incorporation into routine clinical laboratory service.

TI  == beta-lactam susceptibilities and prevalence of esbl-producing isolates among more than 5000 european enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to 15 beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated using enterobacteriaceae isolated during the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active penicillin against escherichia coli,  proteus mirabilis, klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (94.9%, 98.3%, 87.4% and 82.9% of isolates susceptible). of the cephalosporins, cefepime was most effective against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae (99.2%, 96.3% and 95.2% of isolates susceptible, respectively) and cefoxitin against klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae (98.6% and 95.6% of isolates susceptible). carbapenems had excellent activity (> or =99.5% of all  isolates). esbl-production was confirmed with the esbl-etest and disk diffusion test in 1.3% of escherichia coli isolates, 18.4% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 12.6%  of klebsiella oxytoca and 5.3% of proteus mirabilis isolates.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolated from environmental and clinical specimens in a cardiac surgery intensive care unit.
AB  == objectives: to investigate environmental contamination by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and to perform a comparative molecular analysis of clinical and environmental strains. setting: a 17-bed cardiac surgery intensive care unit of a 480-bed university teaching hospital. methods: following an outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, an environmental survey revealed extensive contamination of the environment (particularly faucets, sink drains, and the joints of the countertops) by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae. environmental strains were compared with clinical strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic dna. results: a total of 62 environmental strains belonging to 4 species of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae were analyzed and compared with 43 clinical strains obtained from 34 patients. comparative molecular analysis revealed 4 identical or closely related patterns (3 from klebsiella oxytoca and 1 from enterobacter cloacae) between environmental and clinical strains. conclusions: moist surfaces may serve as sources of multiply resistant enterobacteriaceae in the intensive care unit. identification and disinfection of such sources may therefore be helpful in prevention and control of outbreaks.

TI  == evaluation of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: we aimed to assess the performance of the microscan esbl plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of various species. methods: organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains comprising enterobacter aerogenes (3), enterobacter cloacae (10), escherichia coli (11), klebsiella pneumoniae (26), klebsiella oxytoca (3) and proteus mirabilis (4). also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking esbls, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of ampc enzyme in citrobacter freundii (2), e. aerogenes (3), e. cloacae (3), e. coli (4), hafnia alvei (1) and morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase in k. pneumoniae (3) and e. coli (3) or hyperproduction of k1 enzyme in k. oxytoca (6). results: the microscan mic-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 esbl strains as esbl-positive and 23 of 30 non-esbl strains as esbl-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). false negatives among esbl producers were highest with enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between esbl and ampc beta-lactamases. false-positive classifications occurred in two acinetobacter spp., one e. coli producing plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase and two k. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. conclusion: the microscan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for esbl confirmation. however, this test has limitations in detecting esbls in enterobacter spp. and in discriminating esbl-related resistance from the k1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in acinetobacter spp.

TI  == evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate esbl etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  == objectives: in this study, we evaluated the performance of a new esbl etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate esbl etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) in an enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on enterobacter spp. methods: overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), enterobacter cloacae (n=10), escherichia coli (n=10), klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and proteus mirabilis (n=3). to check etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to esbl, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of k. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase. results: with this panel, esbl etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. concentrating on enterobacter spp., reliable esbl detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed esbl production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. a limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with k1 phenotypes of k. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. conclusion: the new etest esbl strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to  current methods for detection of esbls. in our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of esbls, particularly in enterobacter spp.

TI  == sanitary and bacteriological aspects of sewage treatment.
AB  == a study into the removal of contamination load and indicator bacteria was carried out in 1992-1996 in the mechanical, biological and chemical waste-water treatment plant wtp in lezany, in the county of reszel, in the province of warmia and mazury in poland. the results of chemical analyses found a high efficiency of removal of carbon compounds, cod (90%) and bod (98%), in the process of purification of household sewage. in addition, a high effectiveness of total nitrogen, on average 71%, and unsatisfactory removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found. the results of microbiological analyses confirmed the high efficiency of removal of indicator bacteria in the process of  sewage treatment from 94 to 97%. in the sewage after the final phase of purification in stabilization ponds, the following pathogenic bacteria were identified with the use of the epl 21tests: escherichia coli, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter georgoriae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pnemoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, ervinia herbicola, edwardsiella tarda, serratia odoriefra, serratia marcescens, providencia alcalifaciens, hafnia alvei, yersina pestis, yersina pseudotuberculosis, yersinia fredericksenii, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, aeromons hydrophila, pseudomonas aerulginosa. the obtained results show that although the sewage purification system is efficient and reduces the contamination load to the level required by the regulations (ministry of environmental protection, natural resources and forestry from 20 september 1991)  and removes a great percentage of indicator bacteria, the purified sewage may be  a source of pathogenic bacteria in inland waters.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == a molecular phylogeny for seven taxa of enteric bacteria (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia plymuthica) was made from multiple isolates per taxa taken from a collection of environmental enteric bacteria. sequences from five housekeeping genes (gapa, groel, gyra, ompa, and pgi) and the 16s rrna  gene were used to infer individual gene trees and were concatenated to infer a composite molecular phylogeny for the species. the isolates from each taxa formed tight species clusters in the individual gene trees, suggesting the existence of  'genotypic' clusters that correspond to traditional species designations. these sequence data and the resulting gene trees and consensus tree provide the first data set with which to assess the utility of the recently proposed core genome hypothesis (cgh). the cgh provides a genetically based approach to applying the biological species concept to bacteria.

TI  == confirmation of escherichia coli and its distinction from klebsiella species by gas and indole formation at 44 and 44.5 degrees c.
AB  == aims: in the enumeration of coliform bacteria, confirmation of escherichia coli has been based upon gas and indole production at the elevated incubation temperature. the test for gas production has recently been questioned. the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of gas production test on the reliability of confirmation of e. coli. methods and results: the impact of several media on growth, gas and/or indole formation was tested at 44 and 44.5 degrees c using 547 environmental isolates. these were mainly e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae strains. another set of 250 faecal and environmental klebsiellae were tested for their maximum temperature for growth (tmax) and for gas formation. escherichia coli and even k. pneumoniae  grew well in all the media, but gas production was more dependent on the medium used. growth of the mainly gas negative ent. cloacae and k. oxytoca strains was still more sensitive to the medium and incubation conditions. tryptophan salt broth was the most productive medium for the indole test, followed by lauryl tryptose mannitole and tryptone mannitol ricinoleate broth (trm). tmax of k. oxytoca was clearly lower than tmax of k. pneumoniae but a rather high fraction of its isolates produced indole at 44.5 degrees c. conclusions: false-positive e. coli confirmation is possible if gas production is not tested for and the confirmation is based on indole test only. significance and impact of the study:  erroneous positive results on routine analysis for e. coli can occur.

TI  == evaluation of parameters affecting quantitative detection of escherichia coli o157 in enriched water samples using immunomagnetic electrochemiluminescence.
AB  == we report here the use of immunomagnetic (im) electrochemiluminescence (ecl) for  quantitative detection of esherichia coli o157:h7 in water samples following enrichment in minimal lactose broth (mlb). im beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-o157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. im-ecl responses for e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were similar for  all four commercial anti-o157 lps monoclonal antibodies. the ecl signal was linearly correlated with e. coli o157:h7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ecl response per cell. twenty-two strains of e. coli o157:h7 or o157:nm  gave comparable ecl signals using im beads prepared in-house. to assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in mlb-enriched water samples, 10(4) cells of e. coli o157:h7 (strain sea13b88) were added to enriched  samples prior to analysis. there was considerable variability in recovery of e. coli o157:h7 cells; net ecl signals ranged from 1% to 100% of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0% to 99%). cultures of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from mlb-enriched water samples via im separation (ims), were observed to interfere with the binding of e. coli o157:h7 cells to im beads. recoveries of 10(4) e. coli o157:h7 cells were </=10% in the presence of ca. 10(8) k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, or e. cloacae cells. none of these strains gave a positive im-ecl signal. although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ecl signal and higher e. coli o157:h7 cell concentrations. these studies indicate that im-ecl in conjunction with mlb enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 10(3) to 10(5) e. coli o157:h7 cells ml(-1), depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 10(9) total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml(-1). assuming comparable growth rates for e. coli o157:h7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in mlb, it may be possible to detect as few as one e. coli o157:h7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 10(4) to 10(6) lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).

AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four european countries, canada, and the united states in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  == access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. the present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in europe (france, germany, italy, and spain), canada, and the united states to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. all but two isolates of enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of proteus mirabilis from france and one isolate of morganella morganii from canada) were susceptible to imipenem. the susceptibility of escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for p. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except italy. in contrast, susceptibility  of e. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (spain) to 94.0% (france); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (spain) to 91.6% (united states). among klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of serratia marcescens and m. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. for s. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (france) to 94.1% (italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (germany) to 90.7%  (spain). enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of enterobacteriaceae studied. the present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro  activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == quality control for beta-lactam susceptibility testing with a well-defined collection of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in spain.
AB  == eighteen enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 16 of them with well-defined beta-lactam resistance mechanisms, were sent to 52 spanish microbiology laboratories. interpretative categories for 8 extended-spectrum beta-lactams were collected. participating laboratories used their own routine susceptibility testing procedures (88% automatic systems, 10% disk diffusion, and 2% agar dilution). control results were established by two independent reference  laboratories by applying the nccls microdilution method and interpretative criteria. interpretative discrepancies were observed in 16% of the results (4.4%  for cefepime, 3.0% for aztreonam, 2.8% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.7% for cefotaxime [ctx] and ceftazidime, 1.1% for ceftriaxone, 0.9% for meropenem, and 0.3% for imipenem). high consistency with reference values (<5% of major plus very major errors) was observed with (i) american type culture collection quality control strains; (ii) strains with low-efficiency mechanisms inactivating extended-spectrum beta-lactams, such as oxa-1-producing escherichiacoli or shv-1-hyperproducing klebsiella pneumoniae; (iii) strains with highly efficient mechanisms, such as shv-5 porin-deficient k. pneumoniae, ctx-m-10 in enterobacter cloacae hyperproducing ampc, and p. aeruginosa with the mexab oprm efflux phenotype or hyperproducing ampc. low consistency (>30% major plus very major errors) was detected in k1-producing klebsiella oxytoca, ctx-m-9-producing e. coli, and in oprd(-) p. aeruginosa strains. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains accounted for 86% of very major errors. recognition of the esbl phenotype was particularly low in enterobacter cloacae strains (<35%), due to the lack of nccls-specific rules in this genus. a k1-producing k. oxytoca  was misidentified by 10% of laboratories as an esbl producer. the use of well-defined resistant strains is useful for improving proficiency in susceptibility testing in clinical laboratories.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == a 1.8 kb hinfi fragment carrying the chitinase gene (chia) from serratia marcescens was cloned into the expression vector pkk223-3 and the plasmid pmc71a, yielded the plasmid pkchia and the plasmid pmchia respectively. both plasmid pkchia and plasmid pmchia were used to transform to the enterobacter cloacae strain e26 and the klebsiella oxytoca strain ng13, two nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with rice root. the chia gene could be highly expressed in the chia+ transformants of the strain e26 or the strain ng13. cell location determination of the expressed chitinase showed that the enzyme existed not only in cell periplasm and cytoplasm, but also in extracellular broth. when the cultures were  in the aftor logarithmic growthe phase, the distribution of the enzyme activity in extracellular broth, periplasm and cytoplasm were 23%-28%, 45%-51% and 21%-32%, respectively. the molecular weight of chitinase expressed in the chia+ transformants was 58 kd by sds-page analysis. the stability of the plasmid pmchia in the transformants was better than that of the plasmid pkchia.

TI  == structural requirements of the mrna for intracistronic translation initiation of  the enterobacterial infb gene.
AB  == background: the gene infb encodes the prokaryotic translation initiation factor if2, a central macromolecular component in the formation of the ribosomal 70s initiation complex. in escherichia coli, infb encodes three forms of if2: if2alpha, if2beta and if2gamma. the expression of if2beta and if2gamma is a tandem translation from intact infb mrna and not merely a translation of post-transcriptionally truncated mrna. the molecular mechanism responsible for the ribosomal recognition of the two intracistronic translation initiation sites  in e. coli infb is not well characterized. results: we found three different forms of if2 in enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella enterica, salmonella typhimurium, and two different forms in proteus vulgaris. we identified the intracistronic translation initiation sites of the mrna by isolation and n-terminal sequencing of the shorter isoforms of if2 in s. enterica and s. typhimurium. a further search in the readily available public sequence databases revealed that infb from yersinia pestis also contains an intracistronic in-frame initiation site used for the translation of if2beta. the base composition in a part of the 5' end of the dna coding strand of the enterobacterial infb gene shows a strong preference for adenine (a) over thymine  (t) with a maximum ratio of a-to-t around the intracistronic initiation sites. we demonstrate that the mrna has an open structure around the ribosomal binding region. conclusion: efficient intracistronic translation initiation of the infb gene is suggested to require an mrna with this special base composition that results in an open, single-stranded structure at the ribosomal binding region.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [isolation and characterization of injured coliforms from the drinking water distribution network of la plata, argentina].
AB  == we screened the la plata drinking water distribution network for fecal and total  coliform bacterial indicator by purification procedures, cultivating 66 membrane-filtered samples from the two networks on m-t7 agar. subterranean and river-derived water yielded 13 and 18 confirmed gram-negative bacillus isolates,  with 54% and 72% representing total coliforms, respectively. those from the former source were klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter agglomerans, and enterobacter aerogenes and from the latter klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter agglomerans, and enterobacter cloacae, genomic group 3. since 58% of the samples were positive using m-t7 medium it is suggested that the inclusion in standard quality control  protocols should be implemented.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolone photodegradation products determined by parallel-line bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == the fluoroquinolones produce multiple photodegradation products. little is known  about these products, particularly whether any possess antimicrobial activity. to investigate this, we used the parallel-line bioassay to investigate discrepancies in zone of inhibition size in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis. a continuous flow photochemical reaction unit ('beam-boost') was used to partially photodegrade the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (0.02 mm) by between 15 and 89%, as  confirmed by hplc. the concentration of residual parent fluoroquinolone in each irradiated sample was measured by hplc and a non-irradiated control solution was  prepared at the same concentration. these were compared by parallel-line bioassays using escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. with ofloxacin and levofloxacin, the zone size for the control solution was significantly less than that of the irradiated solutions, with >15% photodegradation in at least two of the indicator organisms, indicating that the  photodegradation products possess antimicrobial activity. no difference was seen  with ciprofloxacin at any level of photodegradation with any of the indicator organisms, nor with moxifloxacin at 30 and 54% photodegradation. a significant difference was observed with e. cloacae only, at 83% photodegradation.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

AB  == the focus of this study was to evaluate the microbial quality of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples including pork loin, chicken croquettes, long pork sausage, chicken breast, and meatballs from university restaurants. microbiological analyses of spanish potato omelette and cooked meat samples resulted in aerobic plate counts from <1.00 to 2.90 and from <1.00 to 6.04 log10  cfu g(-1), respectively. total coliforms ranged from <3 to 43 most probable number (mpn) g(-1) and from <3 to >2,400 mpn g(-1) for spanish potato omelette and meat products, respectively. escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and lancefield group-d streptococci were detected in 1.7%, 3.5%, and 12.9% of spanish potato omelette samples, respectively. for cooked meat samples, 8.8%, 7.6%, and 24.6% contained e. coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and lancefield group-d streptococci, respectively. e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and shigella spp. were not detected. klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia spp. were isolated from spanish potato omelette samples. for cooked meat samples, c. freundii, e. cloacae, and aeromonas hydrophila were detected. the results suggest that some handling practices should require more attention, and as a consequence, a hazard analysis and critical control point program should be  developed and implemented.

TI  == ibc-1, a novel integron-associated class a beta-lactamase with extended-spectrum  properties produced by an enterobacter cloacae clinical strain.
AB  == a transferable beta-lactamase produced by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate  of enterobacter cloacae was studied. the bla gene was carried by a large (>80-kb) transmissible plasmid. nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments revealed  that it was part of a gene cassette carried by a class 1 integron along with other resistance genes, including aac(6')-ib. the encoded beta-lactamase, designated ibc-1, was a novel class a enzyme that hydrolyzed ceftazidime and cefotaxime and was inhibited by tazobactam and, to a lesser extent, by clavulanate. also, imipenem exhibited potent inhibitory activity against ibc-1. the enzyme consisted of 287 amino acid residues, including ser-237, cysteines at  positions 69 and 237a, and arg-244, which may be implicated in its interaction with beta-lactams. in amino acid sequence comparisons, ibc-1 displayed the highest similarity with the chromosomal penicillinase of yersinia enterocolitica, a carbenicillinase from proteus mirabilis gn79, the species-specific beta-lactamases of klebsiella oxytoca, and the carbapenemase sme-1. however, a phylogenetic association with established beta-lactamase clusters could not be conclusively shown.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == bacterial contamination of ready-to-use 1-l feeding bottles and administration sets in severely compromised intensive care patients.
AB  == objective: in intensive care patients, enteral feeding requires sterile feedings  because of infectious complications and adequate supplements to meet nutritional  needs. heretofore, prepacked, large-volume formula containers were developed, but bacterial contamination occurred in 4% to 15%. our objective was to investigate the microbial contamination rate of 1-l feeding bottles and newly designed administration sets over hanging times of 24 hrs in the intensive care unit (icu). design and setting: a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to the icu of a university hospital. patients: all consecutive patients  fed via a nasojejunal tube for at least 4 days. measurements: cultures of feeding bottles, administration sets, and gastric and tracheobronchial aspirates at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. results: a total of 4% of feeding bottles and 74% of infusion  sets contained >10(2) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. gastric and bronchial aspirates were positive in 90% and 92%, respectively. bacterial counts of feeding bottles were 10(2)-10(5) cfu/ml, and the main bacteria isolated included enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, and enterococci. one third of all cultured bacteria in feeding bottles, administration sets, stomach, and lungs belonged to the enterobacteriaceae family, which was held responsible for the nosocomial infections in the icu. none of the 1-l feeding bottles with a hanging  time of 19-24 hrs was contaminated. only bottles that had to be exchanged because of need for a faster rate of infusion proved to be contaminated, apparently without clinical consequences. with time and the increasing severity of disease,  the administration sets became contaminated at an increasingly faster rate and with higher bacterial counts mainly through retrograde growth of endogenous bacteria. the final step of bottle contamination might have been the bacterial transfer by nurses' hands. conclusion: despite an almost ideal design of the enteral nutrition delivery system, a 4% contamination rate of initially sterile feedings with clinically relevant bacteria and the fact that only manipulated systems showed bacterial growth are of concern.

TI  == the distribution of enteric bacteria from australian mammals: host and geographical effects.
AB  == bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 642 mammalian hosts, representing 16 families and 79 species, collected from throughout australia. escherichia coli was the most common of the 24 enteric species recovered and represented almost half of the isolates. association analysis revealed that most  other species of bacteria were less likely to be recovered from hosts in which e. coli was present. the composition of the enteric community of a host was found to be determined by both the taxonomic family to which the host belonged and the geographical area from which the host was collected. hosts collected from the northern areas of queensland and the northern territory had more diverse enteric  communities than hosts collected from new south wales or western australia. hosts of the families petauridae and vespertilionidae had more diverse enteric communities than did members of the macropodidae or phalangeridae. the probability of occurrence of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae in a host was found to vary with respect to host family and/or host locality. the non-random distribution of these species demonstrates the presence of extensive population structure and may suggest the existence of adaptations specific to both the primary and secondary habitats of these enteric bacteria.

TI  == use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among escherichia coli, klebsiella  spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens.
AB  == over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a  panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc beta-lactamases, high levels of k1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. the microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml  and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. the results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high ampc, high k1, and other beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae. these included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. this study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == characterization of sfo-1, a plasmid-mediated inducible class a beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae 8009 produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed cefotaxime efficiently. it also hydrolyzed other beta-lactams except cephamycins and carbapenems. the activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem. the bla gene was transferable to escherichia coli by electroporation of plasmid dna. the molecular mass of the beta-lactamase was 29 kda and its pi was 7.3. all of these phenotypic characteristics of the enzyme except for inducible production resemble those of some extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamases like  fec-1. the gene encoding this beta-lactamase was cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of the beta-lactamase was homologous to the ampa sequences of the serratia fonticola chromosomal enzyme (96%), men-1 (78%), klebsiella oxytoca chromosomal enzymes (77%), toho-1 (75%), and fec-1 (72%). the  conserved sequences of class a beta-lactamases, including the s-x(t)-x(s)-k motif, in the active site were all conserved in this enzyme. on the basis of the  high degree of homology to the beta-lactamase of s. fonticola, the enzyme was named sfo-1. the ampr gene was located upstream of the ampa gene, and the ampr sequence of sfo-1 had homology with the ampr sequences of the chromosomal beta-lactamases from citrobacter diversus (80%), proteus vulgaris (68%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). sfo-1 was also inducible in e. coli. however, a transformant harboring plasmid without intact ampr produced a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, suggesting that ampr works as an activator of ampa of sfo-1. this is the first report from japan describing an inducible plasmid-mediated class a beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the escherichia coli translation initiation factor if2 is a 97 kda protein which  interacts with the initiator fmet-trnafmet, gtp and the ribosomal subunits during initiation of protein biosynthesis. for structural and functional investigations  of the factor, we have raised and characterised monoclonal antibodies against e.  coli if2. twelve epitopes have been localised at the surface of the protein molecule by three different methods: interactions of the monoclonal antibodies with nested deletion mutants of if2, comparison of the relative location of the epitopes in a competition immunoassay and cross-reactivity analyses of the monoclonal antibodies towards if2 from salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, and bacillus stearothermophilus. these data are combined with predicted secondary structure and discussed in relation to a six-domain structural model for if2. the model describes if2 as a slightly elongated molecule with a structurally compact c-terminal domain, a well-conserved central gtp-binding domain, and a highly charged, solvent exposed  n-terminal with protruding alpha-helical structures.

TI  == gyra mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == fluoroquinolone resistance (fq-r) in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. two mechanisms of fq-r have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in  dna gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. a single point mutation in gyra has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. to determine the extent of gyra mutations associated with fq-r in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. this set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the qrdrs from 8 enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens. although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of e. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyra qrdr were highly conserved. conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the qrdrs of the susceptible type strains of c. freundii, e. aerogenes, k. oxytoca (ser-83 to  thr), and p. stuartii (asp-87 to glu). strains with ciprofloxacin mics of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the gly-81, ser-83, or  asp-87 position. fluoroquinolone mics varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyra mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyra contribute to  resistance. the type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. high-level fq-r frequently was associated with single gyra mutations in all species of enterobacteriaceae in this study except e. coli.

TI  == total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  == background: the extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the centers for disease control and prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration  set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. for nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (tna), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. methods: we prospectively studied in a representative tna (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; ph 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (d5%/w), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees c of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp, and candida albicans, and two isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate tna during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. results: growth in tna at 25 and 35 degrees c occurred with only two species, c. albicans  and s. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; d5%/w allowed growth at 25 degrees c of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. conclusions: we conclude that tna is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than d5%/w. the need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with tna should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.

AB  == reconstituted recombinant factor viii (fviiirec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less fviiirec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. however, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a  concern with continuous infusion. we studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees c in reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) and at 25 degrees c in 5% dextrose in water (d5%w) of three isolates each of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, flavobacterium spp. and candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. reconstituted fviiirec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c: s. marcescens, s. maltophilia and p. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. d5%w allowed growth of two gram-negative species, s. marcescens and b. cepacia. we conclude that reconstituted fviiirec (kogenate) is  a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with d5%w. if reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted fviiirec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.

TI  == interactions of beta-lactamases with sanfetrinem (gv 104326) compared to those with imipenem and with oral beta-lactams.
AB  == sanfetrinem is a trinem beta-lactam which can be administered orally as a hexatil ester. we examined whether its beta-lactamase interactions resembled those of the available carbapenems, i.e., stable to ampc and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases but labile to class b and functional group 2f enzymes. the comparator drugs were  imipenem, oral cephalosporins, and amoxicillin. mics were determined for beta-lactamase expression variants, and hydrolysis was examined directly with representative enzymes. sanfetrinem was a weak inducer of ampc beta-lactamases below the mic and had slight lability, with a kcat of 0.00033 s(-1) for the enterobacter cloacae enzyme. its mics for ampc-derepressed e. cloacae and citrobacter freundii were 4 to 8 microg/ml, compared with mics of 0.12 to 2 microg/ml for ampc-inducible and -basal strains; mics for ampc-derepressed serratia marcescens and morganella morganii were not raised. cefixime and cefpodoxime were more labile than sanfetrinem to the e. cloacae ampc enzyme, and  ampc-derepressed mutants showed much greater resistance; imipenem was more stable and retained full activity against derepressed mutants. like imipenem, sanfetrinem was stable to tem-1 and tem-10 enzymes and retained full activity against isolates and transconjugants with various extended-spectrum tem and shv enzymes, whereas these organisms were resistant to cefixime and cefpodoxime. sanfetrinem, like imipenem and cefixime but unlike cefpodoxime, also retained activity against proteus vulgaris and klebsiella oxytoca strains that hyperproduced potent chromosomal class a beta-lactamases. functional group 2f enzymes, including sme-1, nmc-a, and an unnamed enzyme from acinetobacter spp., increased the sanfetrinem mics by up to 64-fold. these enzymes also compromised the activities of imipenem and amoxicillin but not those of the cephalosporins. the hydrolysis of sanfetrinem was examined with a purified sme-1 enzyme, and biphasic kinetics were found. finally, zinc beta-lactamases, including imp-1 and  the l1 enzyme of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, conferred resistance to sanfetrinem and all other beta-lactams tested, and hydrolysis was confirmed with  the imp-1 enzyme. we conclude that sanfetrinem has beta-lactamase interactions similar to those of the available carbapenems except that it is a weaker inducer  of ampc types, with some tendency to select derepressed mutants, unlike imipenem  and meropenem.

TI  == production of escherichia coli group i-like heat-labile enterotoxin by enterobacteriaceae isolated from environmental water.
AB  == strains of klebsiella oxytoca (2), citrobacter freundii (2), enterobacter cloacae (1) and escherichia coli (1) isolated from environmental water were identified as heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) producing strains by immunological methods and polymerase chain amplification. a 322 bp amplified fragment was obtained with specific primers ltr and ltl, and hybridized to a digoxigenin-labelled ltb probe  only under low stringency conditions, and not with a cholera toxin probe. these results suggest that enterobacteriaceae may produce a lt-like toxin antigenically and genetically related to the lt enterotoxin of e. coli.

TI  == effect of calcium phosphate ceramics on gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
AB  == this paper discusses the results of an experimental study on the effect of biphase calcium phosphate ceramics (bcpc) on laboratory-isolated polyresistant gram-negative bacteria. monitoring of this effect in a dynamical regimen was carried out upon enterobacter cloacae 313, klebsiella pneumoniae 227, serratia marcescens 206, klebsiella oxytoca 202, as well as on the standard strain klebsiella pneumoniae 52145 (institute pasteur, paris). the results show a significant antimicrobial effect of the ceramics. antimicrobial properties are manifested during direct contact with bcpc and these depend on the quantity and grain size of the particles, as well as on the microbiological characteristics of the test microorganisms, and particularly on their cell size.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from severe infections in 1992: results of a french multicenter study. groupe d'etude d'infections a bacilles a gram negatif (geign)].
AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == occurrence of a novel l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase activity in some species of enterobacteriaceae, and purification and characterization of the enzymes of enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens.
AB  == l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase (daba dc) is a novel enzyme yielding 1,3-diaminopropane (dap) from daba, which has previously been purified from strains of the genera vibrio and acinetobacter. in this study, we also detected daba dc activity in the species of enterobacteriaceae: e. aerogenes, e. cloacae,  e. agglomerans, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, klebsiella pneumoniace, k.  oxytoca and citrobacter freundii, all of which produced dap in sufficient amounts. subsequently, the daba dcs of e. aerogenes and s. marcescens were purified to homogeneity and characterized. two separate enzymes had similar properties with respect to chromatographic behaviors, and were a dimer with subunits of identical molecular mass of about 51 kda. the maximal activity of each enzyme was obtained at ph 8.0-8.25. both enzymes required pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and mg2+ for full activity, and were highly specific for l-daba. there was immunological similarity, but not identity between these proteins, as determined by ouchterlony double diffusion analysis with antiserum against the e. aerogenes daba dc. they showed the same n-terminal amino acid sequence up to the  8th residue (s-k-l-n-p-i-l-a-). these enzymes were different in molecular mass, n-terminal amino acid sequence and antigenicity from daba dcs of acientobacter and vibrio species.

AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  == intestinal colonization by klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia (kes) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. we studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 kes clinical isolates: 30 klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 serratia sp. (13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

TI  == gram-negative bacteremia in open-heart-surgery patients traced to probable tap-water contamination of pressure-monitoring equipment.
AB  == objective: to determine the cause(s) of an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia (gnb) in open-heart-surgery (ohs) patients at hospital a. design: case-control and cohort studies and an environmental survey. results: nine patients developed  gnb with enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (3), serratia marcescens (2), or klebsiella oxytoca (1) following ohs; five of nine patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. when the gnb patients were compared with randomly selected ohs patients, having had the first procedure of the day (8 of 9 versus 12 of 27, p = .02), longer cardiopulmonary bypass (median, 122 versus 83 minutes, p = .01) or cross-clamp times (median, 75 versus 42 minutes, p = .008), intraoperative dopamine infusion (9 of 9 versus 15 of 27, p = .01), or exposure to scrub nurse 6 (6 of 9 versus 4 of 27, p = .001) were identified as risk factors. when stratified by length of the procedure, only being the first procedure of the day and exposure to scrub nurse 6 remained significant. first procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment that was assembled before surgery and left open and uncovered overnight in the operating room, whereas other procedures used pressure-monitoring equipment assembled immediately before the procedure. at night, operating rooms were cleaned by maintenance personnel who used a disinfectant-water solution sprayed through a hose connected to an automatic diluting system. observation of the use of this hose documented that this solution could have contacted and entered uncovered pressure-monitoring equipment left in the operating room. water samples from the  hose revealed no disinfectant, but grew p aeruginosa. the outbreak was terminated by setting up pressure-monitoring equipment immediately before the procedure and  discontinuing use of the hose-disinfectant system. conclusions: this outbreak most likely resulted from contamination of uncovered preassembled pressure-monitoring equipment by water from a malfunctioning spray disinfectant device. pressure-monitoring equipment should be assembled immediately before use  and protected from possible environmental contamination.

TI  == sulbactam and clavulanic acid: enzyme kinetics and synergy with ampicillin and mezlocillin.
AB  == the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, sulbactam and clavulanic acid, exhibit high affinity (k(i) < 10(-6)mol/l) for the beta-lactamases of gram-negative organisms  with predominantly penicillinase activity and much less affinity (especially clavulanic acid) for organisms with predominantly cephalosporinase activity. in tests to compare the synergy of these beta-lactamase inhibitors with other antibiotics, clavulanic acid and ampicillin or mezlocillin demonstrated greater synergy than sulbactam and ampicillin or mezlocillin, with isolates forming either a plasmid-coded beta-lactamase or a chromosomal enzyme with predominantly  penicillinase activity. however, neither sulbactam nor clavulanic acid were able  to protect ampicillin or mezlocillin adequately against inactivation by beta-lactamase overproducing variants of klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca, irrespective of the extent of synergy seen with the corresponding wild strains. it was interesting to note the synergy between mezlocillin and sulbactam with respect to beta-lactamase overproducing variants of clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae. a statistically significant correlation between the quantities of beta-lactamase formed and synergy between the beta-lactamase inhibitor and the antibiotic with which it was combined was not retained in studies of clinical isolates in any case. these observations correlate well with  the results obtained in routine testing of the combinations of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin/sulbactam.

AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == kinetics of colonization of adult queensland fruit flies (bactrocera tryoni) by dinitrogen-fixing alimentary tract bacteria.
AB  == the average total population of bacteria remained constant in the alimentary tracts of adult laboratory-raised queensland fruit flies (bactrocera tryoni) although the insects had ingested large numbers of live bacteria as part of their diet. the mean number of bacteria (about 13 million) present in the gut of the insects from 12 to 55 days after emergence was not significantly modified when, at 5 days after emergence, the flies were fed antibiotic-resistant bacteria belonging to two species commonly isolated from the gut of field-collected b. tryoni. flies were fed one marked dinitrogen-fixing strain each of either klebsiella oxytoca or enterobacter cloacae, and the gastrointestinal tracts of fed flies were shown to be colonized within 7 days by antibiotic-resistant isolates of k. oxytoca but not e. cloacae. the composition of the microbial population also appeared to be stable in that the distribution and frequency of bacterial taxa among individual flies exhibited similar patterns whether or not the flies had been bacteria fed. isolates of either e. cloacae or k. oxytoca, constituting 70% of the total numbers, were usually dominant, with oxidative species including pseudomonads forming the balance of the population. antibiotic-resistant bacteria could be spread from one cage of flies to the adjacent surfaces of a second cage within a few days and had reached a control group several meters distant by 3 weeks. restriction of marked bacteria to the population of one in five flies sampled from the control group over the next 30 days suggested that the bacterial population in the gut of the insect was susceptible to alteration in the first week after emergence but that thereafter it entered a steady state and was less likely to be perturbed by the introduction of newly encountered strains. all populations sampled, including controls, included at least one isolate of the dinitrogen-fixing family enterobacteriaceae; many were distinct from the marked strains fed to the flies. nitrogenase activity detected by the acetylene reduction assay was associated with flies fed dinitrogen-fixing bacteria as well as with control groups given either no supplement or free access to a yeast hydrolysate preparation. nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere may supplement the nutrition of the alimentary tract microbial population of b. tryoni. transmission electron microscopy showed that the principal site of bacterial colonization in the abdominal alimentary tract was the lumen of the midgut inside the peritrophic membrane. no intracellular symbionts were seen in the gut tissues nor were bacteria found attached to the cuticular folds of the hindgut. the ultrastructure of the gut resembled that of other fly genera except that the intercellular spaces between rectal epithelial cells were more extensive, suggesting a role for unspecialized epithelium in water and solute uptake in b. tryoni.

AB  == we carried out quantitative culturing of stools from 31 hospitalized alcoholic patients with cirrhosis and ascites, before treatment with 400 mg of norfloxacin  per day, weekly for the first month, and then every 2 weeks thereafter for 15 to  229 days (median, 54 days). members of the family enterobacteriaceae virtually disappeared from the stools (< 10(2)/g), but treatment had little effect on enterococci. no selection of resistant organisms occurred in 15 patients, but the remaining 16 patients developed fecal organisms resistant to fluoroquinolones between days 14 and 43 of treatment (median, 25 days). staphylococcus aureus was  isolated four times, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. were isolated six times, citrobacter freundii was isolated four times, enterobacter cloacae was isolated three times, klebsiella oxytoca was isolated twice, proteus rettgeri was isolated once, and untypeable streptococci were isolated six times. some isolates persisted, while others were transient (one to seven consecutively positive cultures). the mics of four quinolones (nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) were determined by use of experimental microwell strips (atb cmi; biomerieux s.a.). all the strains isolated before treatment were susceptible to the four quinolones, with low mics, whereas those isolated during norfloxacin  treatment were highly resistant. long-term norfloxacin administration thus carries a risk of disturbing the bacterial ecology in these patients, suggesting  that digestive decontamination should no longer be prescribed routinely to cirrhotic patients with ascites.

TI  == controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and septi-chek release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  == a controlled clinical comparison was made of the isolator (wampole laboratories,  cranbury, n.j.) and the septi-chek release bottle (roche diagnostics, nutley, n.j.). from 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to centers for disease control definitions. statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the isolator system: staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.0001), alcaligenes xylosoxidans (p = 0.008), klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.05), salmonella spp. (p = 0.03), and candida albicans (p = 0.02). the septi-chek release system required a longer period of time than the isolator system for detection of the following organisms:s. aureus (p = 0.0001), enterococcus spp. (p = 0.0001), enterobacter cloacae (p = 0.03), escherichia coli (p = 0.0001), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.03), k. pneumoniae (p = 0.02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.002), and c. albicans (p = 0.005). there were 430 episodes of bloodstream  infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to s. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (p = 0.0001) by the isolator system than by the septi-chek release system. however, episodes of bloodstream infections due to s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus spp., and e. coli were detected significantly faster by the isolator system.

TI  == bacterial load of cockroaches in relation to urban environment.
AB  == sanitation is an important problem in relation to the control of pests in urban environments. this investigation analysed the potential risk related to the presence of cockroaches and their capacity for disseminating bacteria in six different types of buildings: hospital nursing area and out-patient area, swimming-pool pool-side and toilet area, low-income flats and food-handling places. fifty-six species of bacteria were identified from 157 samples, 14 of these have previously been reported as potentially pathogenic for man and vertebrates. similarities were found between samples collected in (a) the hospital out-patient area and food-handling establishments and (b) the hospital nursing area and flats. pool-sides possessed a poorer bacterial flora. there was  a greater bacterial specific diversity in food-handling establishments, flats and swimming-bath toilet area. enterobacter cloacae. klebsiella pneumoniae and klebsiella oxytoca were dominant species in flats and the hospital nursing area.  therefore, cockroaches can play a role in disseminating bacteria, which they can  carry passively on their cuticle.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

TI  == [effect of meropenem on fecal flora in children].
AB  == meropenem (mepm, sm-7338), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined for its effect on intestinal flora in children. seven children with infectious diseases (3 male and 4 female children of age's ranging from 4 months to 8 years  and 9 months weighing from 7.3 to 23.0 kg) were treated with mepm at doses ranging 10.3 to 40.5 mg/kg 3 or 4 times a day for 6 to 12 days. before, during and after the treatment, identities and numbers of various bacteria contained in  1 g of feces were determined and fecal beta-lactamase activity and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. changes in fecal flora during mepm treatment was somewhat different depending on cases. regarding enterobacteriaceae among aerobes, all of 7 cases exhibited moderate or pronounced reductions in escherichia coli. some of the cases exhibited the tendency to increase in klebsiella oxytoca. enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii. e. coli which  was reduced during the treatment increased rapidly after the treatment in 5 out of 7 cases, and the initial bacterial counts were restored. diverse strains were  observed within the genus enterococcus, while the overall bacterial counts of this genus exhibited the tendency to increase during the treatment. as a result,  no significant change in total aerobe count was observed in any case except 1 case where enterococcus count was somewhat reduced. among anaerobes, major bacteria such as bacteroides, bifidobacterium, eubacterium and peptococcaceae exhibited tendencies to decrease in some cases during the antibiotic treatment. two infants and 1 child exhibited significant decreases in total anaerobe counts. in most of the cases, such changes in major anaerobes were transient and bacterial counts recovered to their initial values rapidly after completion of the treatment. in no cases, glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungus became predominant. although c. difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 4 cases, its changes had no relationship with characteristics of feces. c. difficile was not detected in any of the cases. mepm was detected in feces in 4 cases being treatment, in concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 66.0 micrograms/g.  fecal mepm levels were very low except in 1 case in which beta-lactamase was negative. from these results, effects of mepm on intestinal flora in children were relatively minor compared to other new beta-lactam drugs. however, a care should be taken to minimize diarrhea and bacterial turnover when a prolonged use  of the antibiotic, was practiced because of potential significant effects on intestinal flora.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or  equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter  cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than  16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but  it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.

TI  == fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. the frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. in this study isolates belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. type 3, p, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. the klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. also, both type 3 and escherichia coli p fimbrial genotypes  were detected by using dna colony blot assays. the frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: enterobacter (38.6%), klebsiella (26.8%), serratia (17.7%), e. coli (13%), and proteus (5.2%). isolates of klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. the phenotype and genotype for e. coli p fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. in addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of enterobacter aerogenes. finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among k. oxytoca and proteus mirabilis isolates. the frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role  for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.

AB  == an in-vitro kinetic model was used to demonstrate the bactericidal activity of concentrations of temocillin achieved in extravascular body fluids following a 1  g intravenous dosage in man. concentrations of temocillin attainable in peripheral lymph were bactericidal for ampicillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca. likewise, concentrations of temocillin achieved in human blister fluid following a 12-hourly dosage regimen were bactericidal for cultures of ent. cloacae and k. oxytoca which were resistant, respectively, to simulated blister fluid concentrations of cefotaxime and aztreonam. the bactericidal activity of extravascular concentrations of temocillin against these multiresistant, gram-negative bacteria was a reflection of the beta-lactamase-stability and good  pharmacokinetic properties of temocillin.

AB  == 653 11 beer mugs rinsed mechanically by conveyor belt dishwashing machines and 182 mugs cleaned in open vats were investigated for their content of faecal and total coliforms. ten and more faecal coliform germs could be detected in 4.7% of  the mechanically rinsed tankards and in 12.1% of those cleaned in open vats. respectively, ten and more total coliforms were found in 30.3% and in 67.6%. altogether 213 coliform strains as defined by the german drinking water regulation were characterised biochemically by the api 20 e-system and by their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents. a total of 19 different species from eight genera could be differentiated, whereas 12 strains were unidentifiable by the applied system. klebsiella oxytoca was the most frequently encountered germ,  followed by enterobacter cloacae, k. pneumoniae and ent. sakazakii. 59 of the 213 strains were fully susceptible to all antibiotics used. 44 strains, however, revealed complete or moderate resistance against three and more agents. these results indicate that unhygienic dishwashing procedures may play a decisive role  in the epidemiology of clinically relevant and multiresistant germs.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae and acinetobacter in human periodontitis.
AB  == this study examined the occurrence of non-oral gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods in advanced adult periodontitis. speciation and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the microscan micromethod system. a total of 42 taxa of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae and acinetobacter were isolated from 427 of 3,050 (14.0%) patients. in 159 (5.2%) patients, these organisms comprised more than 5% of the cultivable subgingival microflora. enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter agglomerans accounted for more than 50% of all strains isolated. virtually all study strains demonstrated high in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to 18 other antimicrobial agents tested. in 3 "refractory" periodontitis patients heavily infected with enteric rods, systemic ciprofloxacin therapy (500 mg bid for 10 days) led to resolution of the subgingival infections and improved clinical periodontal status. the present findings indicate that 5% of severe periodontitis lesions may harbor high levels of non-oral, gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods. systemic ciprofloxacin appears to be capable of eradicating these potential pathogens from deep periodontal pockets.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of tem-3 (ctx-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  == a total of 33 clinical isolates encoding tem-3 (ctx-1) from four french hospitals were studied. the strains belonged to seven species, klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), escherichia coli (n = 3), serratia marcescens (n = 2), citrobacter freundii  (n = 1), enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). all the strains harbored an inc7 or m self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. the plasmids had closely related ecori, hincii, hindiii, and pvuii restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the  genes blatem-3 and tetc, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aaca4, aada, and dfri and of insertion element is15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. plasmid pcff04, the prototype plasmid encoding tem-3, was widespread and appeared, by southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. the plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of tem-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae may have originated in s. marcescens since pcff04 was first detected in this species.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == [susceptibility of gram-negative bacterial isolates to six beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics at our university hospital].
AB  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the university hospital in 1987 to six beta-lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. most of the strains belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. they were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. most strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. more than half of the strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in pseudomonas maltophilia.

TI  == simple assay of beta-lactamase with agar medium containing a chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac).
AB  == a new beta-lactamase assay method with agar plates containing pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore (padac) (50 microm), a beta-lactamase-labile, chromogenic cephalosporin, was examined. on the padac plates inoculated with beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (10(4) cfu per spot) and incubated at 37 degrees c, a yellow zone showing hydrolysis of padac by beta-lactamase was formed around the colony. the zone diameter increased with incubation time. examination with enterobacter cloacae gn7471 revealed that  beta-lactamase activity was present in the agar around the colony, decreasing exponentially with increasing distance from the colonial margin; this suggests that the padac hydrolysis zone is formed by an extracellular enzyme. at 18 h, significant correlations were obtained between the zone diameters of the 10 species (clinical isolates) examined and their periplasmic beta-lactamase activities determined spectrophotometrically. the addition of clavulanic acid (0.5 to 10 micrograms/ml) inhibited zone formation on the padac plates inoculated with type iiia, va, vb, pse-1, and ic beta-lactamase producers. when the clinical isolates were tested on plates with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml), inhibition was observed in 41 to 58% of the escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and in all isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, and proteus vulgaris. thus, the use of the inhibitor made it  possible to detect penicillinase or type ic cephalosporinase producers. these results proved that the padac plate might be a useful tool permitting easy, semiquantitative determination of beta-lactamase activity.

TI  == epidemiology of fecal strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in 22 neonatal wards and influence of antibiotic policy.
AB  == the gram-negative fecal floras from 953 infants were studied upon discharge of the infants from 22 neonatal wards. more than 600 distinct phenotypes of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. were distinguished by high-resolution biotyping. the colonization patterns observed showed considerable local and temporal variation. the major (m) strains (phenotypes), which colonized more than 10% and up to 78% of the infants in a ward (median, 23%), were klebsiella oxytoca (15 strains), e. coli (4 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1 strain), and enterobacter cloacae (1 strain). resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was more pronounced among m strains than among strains of enteric bacteria colonizing few or single infants only. local antibiotic policy influenced the colonization patterns. despite the fact that m strains of klebsiella spp. were usually resistant to ampicillin as well as to cephalexin and cefuroxime, their local dissemination was associated with the use of ampicillin with or without gentamicin but not with the use of cefuroxime. it thus appeared that in the neonatal setting, ampicillin posed a greater risk of local spread of  certain drug-resistant bacterial clones than a newer cephalosporin, such as cefuroxime.

TI  == clinical consequences of development of resistance to third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == eighteen patients are described in whom initially sensitive microorganisms were replaced by resistant isolates during administration of ceftriaxone (n = 8), cefoperazone (n = 5), moxalactam (n = 4), cefotaxime (n = 2) or ceftazidime (n =  1), despite combination with aminoglycosides. all patients had documented gram-negative infections; in 12 patients underlying haematological diseases were  present. resistant strains of enterobacter cloacae (14), serratia marcescens (4), klebsiella oxytoca (3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2) and citrobacter freundii (2) emerged within 2 to 19 (mean 9) days after the beginning of treatment. in 12 patients relapse or secondary infections occurred. seven of the patients with haematological disorders died. resistance development was seen in 8 of 29 patients on ceftriaxone and 4 of 10 patients on moxalactam during prospective evaluations; the other drugs were used sporadically. thus, selection of resistant bacteria is relatively frequent and may have serious clinical consequences in patients with impaired host-defense mechanisms.

TI  == non-ige-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  == a wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca and k. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that e. coli-induced histamine release differed from ige-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and ph profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. a lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. escherichia coli and anti-ige did not synergize in inducing histamine release. the production of pgd2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with e. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == ceftetrame (ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and  streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. they did not inhibit s. faecalis, s. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jk species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates,  were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. both agents inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, shigella species, citrobacter diversus, and aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. a marked inoculum effect was noted for enterobacteriaceae carrying the richmond-sykes type 1a chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. cloacae, p99.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of foramidocillin.
AB  == foramidocillin is a 6-alpha-formamido penicillin with a 6-beta-acylureido side chain. the majority of the enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram of foramidocillin per ml, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. foramidocillin had activity comparable to those of  ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam against beta-lactamase-producing members of  the enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and it inhibited organisms resistant to piperacillin. foramidocillin did not inhibit gram-positive species or anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. foramidocillin was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, oxa-2, pse-4, and shv-1, by the chromosomal beta-lactamases p99 of enterobacter cloacae and k1 of klebsiella oxytoca, or by the sabath-abraham enzyme of p. aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime (ctx) in eight species of enterobacteriaceae was carried out. one strain of each species was examined. the  strains represented their individual species as regards natural susceptibility to ampicillin (a) and carbenicillin (ca). cephalothinase activity of the parental strains and strains selected on the plates with the highest concentration that allowed growth was determined by an ultraviolet assay. the populations of the a-susceptible/ca-susceptible (a-s/ca-s) species, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to ctx. the a-resistant/ca-resistant (a-r/ca-r) species, klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri, were less homogeneous, but in all four mentioned species no increase in cephalothinase activity was observed between the parental strains and the strains selected in the population analysis. the four a-r/ca-s species, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, were heterogeneous. the frequency of ctx-r mutants was approx. 10(-6.5). the ic50 for  ctx was 2(7.5)-2(8.5) times higher for the mutants than for the parental strains. the ctx resistance was maintained in subcultures of the strains. all four species had a very high increase in cephalothinase activity from parental strains to the  strains selected in the population analysis. only the enzyme of proteus vulgaris  was able to hydrolyze ctx.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == temocillin. in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == temocillin, a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin derivative, was tested in vitro against  516 recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the compound exhibited good antibacterial activity, with 95% of isolates inhibited by a range 2 to 16 mg/l. further studies, against selected isolates resistant to ticarcillin, piperacillin and cefuroxime (klebsiella oxytoca, 25; enterobacter species, 34; and citrobacter species, 5), showed about half of the isolates of k. oxytoca (11/25) to be resistant to aztreonam (mic range 16-greater than or equal to 128 mg/l), but susceptible to temocillin, cefotaxime and latamoxef. in general, the resistant strains of enterobacter species tested were not susceptible to cefotaxime (mic range 16-128 mg/l), or aztreonam (mic range 1.0-64 mg/l), and many exhibited reduced susceptibility to latamoxef (mic range 2-128 mg/l). in contrast, all the  strains were susceptible to temocillin (mic range 4-16 mg/l). the bactericidal activity of temocillin was confirmed against selected aztreonam-resistant strains of k. oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae by conventional time-kill studies, and against a strain of e. cloacae in an in vitro model system designed to simulate the temocillin concentration profiles attained in extravascular fluid such as peripheral lymph. in the time-kill studies, temocillin concentrations of 16 and 32 mg/l were shown to effectively reduce the numbers of viable bacteria by 99 and 99.9%, respectively, within 12 hours. in the in vitro model system the numbers of bacteria were reduced 99.9% over the initial 4-hour period. in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, temocillin exerted a synergistic or partially synergistic effect (sigma fic less than or equal to 0.75) against the majority of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa tested. when combined with piperacillin, cefotaxime or latamoxef, temocillin, unlike cefoxitin, exhibited no antagonism against strains of enterobacteriaceae producing inducible cephalosporinases.

(i) k. aerogenes was the most common among klebsiella species, k. ozaenae and k. atlantae occurred frequently, k. pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis,  k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca were found rarely. the strains isolated from urine showed the most heterogeneous species distribution. enterobacter species were in  the order of frequency e. cloacae, e. liquefaciens, e. aerogenes. (ii) k. aerogenes strains belonged to 10, k. atlantae strains to 6 phage types; phage type ii.a1 was the most frequent phage types. typability varied between 23.7% and 48.0% with the different klebsiella species, except k. edwardsii and k. oxytoca strains. none of the strains of these species were typable by phages. among the enterobacter species examined, only one e. liquefaciens strain was typable by phages. strains of genus enterobacter were lysed by the diagnostic phage c14 in 64%, no lysis was observed in the strains of genus klebsiella. (iii) multiple resistance was demonstrated in 36.6% of klebsiella strains and in 16.5% of enterobacter strains. the majority of the multiresistant strains was isolated from urine in both genera. multiresistant strains belonged to the species k. aerogenes, e. cloacae and e. liquefaciens. strains resistant to ampicillin were divided into 6 groups on the basis of cephaloridine and cephalothin resistance. the rate of multiresistant strains was higher among the klebsiella and enterobacter strains not typable by phages than in the typable ones.

AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
