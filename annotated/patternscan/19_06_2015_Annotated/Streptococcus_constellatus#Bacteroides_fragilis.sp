TI  == an uncommon late complication of appendicitis.
AB  == a 10-year-old boy presented with a 2.5-week history of right leg pain and limp. a right flank mass was noted by a parent on the day of presentation. the child's past medical history was remarkable for perforated appendicitis treated with an interval laparoscopic appendectomy 2 years before this presentation. abdominal and pelvic computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal mass with calcifications, suggestive of a retained appendicolith with abscess formation. this case illustrates the importance of considering very late complications of appendicitis in patients presenting with fever and abdominal or flank pain or masses.

TI  == isolation of eikenella corrodens from polymicrobial hepatic abscess: report of one case.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a rare cause of hepatic abscess. we report a case of a hepatic abscess caused by (1) bacteroides fragilis, (2) streptococcus constellatus and (3) e. corrodens, which illustrates potential problems of antibiotic coverage due to the presence of eikenella species. the infection followed an episode of acute gastroenteritis and the clinical course appeared indolent evolving over one week. besides empirical antibiotics, initial percutaneous aspiration was performed and yielded pus which grew e. corrodens concomitantly with streptococcus species. e. corrodens was sensitive to penicillin but resistant to clindamycin and metronidazole. but b. fragilis was resistant to penicillin. so the antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin/clavulanate. unfortunately fever persisted and the abscess increased  in size. therefore echo-guided percutaneous drainage with pigtail catheter was installed. fever subsided 5 days later. after 21 days treatment of antibiotics, the patient was discharged in good condition despite having some sterile fluid in the residual abscess cavity. two months after discharge the follow-up echogram confirmed complete resolution of the residual abscess. this patient shows us the  existence of e. corrodens in pediatric patients, especially when the hepatic abscess is very likely from the spread of an oral or abdominal infection.

TI  == microaerophilic streptococcal infection in children.
AB  == a total of 148 isolates of microaerophilic streptococci (ms) (47 streptococcus constellatus, 43 streptococcus intermedius and five gemella morbillorum) were cultured from 123 children. there were predisposing conditions in 47 (38%) patients of which most common were previous surgery (14), trauma (11), malignancy (9) diabetes (6) and immunodeficiency (5). ms were the only bacteria isolated from 12 (10%) patients and mixed infections were encountered in 111, when the number of isolates varied between two and seven (average 3.0) isolates per specimen. the bacteria most commonly isolated with ms were anaerobic cocci (70 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (54), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (34) and escherichia coli (26). most b. fragilis and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections, and those of skin and soft tissue adjacent to the rectum. most pigmented prevotella and fusobacteria were isolated  from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, head and neck sites. most ms were recovered from abscesses (43%), the abdominal cavity (17%), sinuses (10%) and chest infections (9%). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients, in 61 this was combined with surgical drainage or correction. three patients died. these data illustrate that ms can occasionally be associated with infection in children.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).
