TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Bivalvular endocarditis due to Granulicatella adiacens.
AB  - PATIENT: Male, 50 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Bivalvular endocarditis due to Granulicatella  adiacens Symptoms: Fever * fatigue MEDICATION: - Clinical Procedure: Echocardiogram * valve replacement surgery Specialty: Infectious Diseases. OBJECTIVE: Rare disease. BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis remains a prominent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that 50% of cases are caused by streptococcal organisms. Abiotrophia and Granulicatella, often grouped as nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), have become recognized as the cause of nearly 5% of infective endocarditis cases. NVS endocarditis historically has a higher rate of morbidity and mortality, partially due to difficulties in adequately culturing and treating the causative organisms. CASE REPORT: In this report, we review the complicated hospital course and successful treatment of a middle aged Hispanic gentleman who presented with systemic symptoms of fevers, chills and weight loss over 3 months. He was found to have Granulicatella infective endocarditis of the mitral and aortic valves, presumably from a dental source. Despite severe valvular insufficiency noted on echocardiogram, the patient did not initially present with any symptoms of decompensated heart failure. With adequate antibiotic therapy followed by replacement of both valves, the patient had a successful recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the growing role that nutritionally variant streptococcus plays in endocarditis and how crucial early identification of the organism is to proper treatment. A brief literature review is also included about the diagnosis and recommended management of nutritionally variant streptococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Granulicatella adiacens.
AB  - Granulicatella adiacens, a recently nomenclatured bacterium, was considered as one of the nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) and is a mouth commensal. It is redesignated as a streptococcus like bacterium since it differs from streptococci. We report a case of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by this fastidious and unusual bacteria in a 63-year-old man with rheumatic valvular heart disease. G. adiacens was isolated from four of his blood culture samples, which was sensitive to beta lactams, moderately sensitive to gentamicin and resistant to erythromycin and co-trimoxazole. Patient recovered completely on treatment with high dose of ampicillin and gentamicin for 28 days.
TI  - Microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by Sanger sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty subjects were assigned to a Control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a Test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). In the Test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. In both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16S rRNA sequences. RESULTS: The phylogenetic identity of 1387 16S rRNA gene clones was determined. Healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of Actinomyces, Atopobium, Gemella, Kingella and Rothia and lower levels of Campylobacter, Desulfobulbus, Dialister, Eubacterium, Filifactor, Mitsukella, Porphyromonas and Pseudoramibacter (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). Fusobacterium nucleatum, Dialister invisus, Streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (HOT) 064, Filifactor alocis and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while Veillonella dispar, Actinomyces meyeri, Granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the Control and Test groups (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. The biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as F. alocis, D. invisus and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131.
TI  - Microbial transformation from normal oral microbiota to acute endodontic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endodontic infections are a leading cause of oro-facial pain and tooth loss in western countries, and may lead to severe life-threatening infections. These infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity. Understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. We obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). Microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. Bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. RESULTS: On average, 10,000 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from each sample. All sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla. The microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples. Streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while Prevotella and Fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples. The microbiota community structures of root canal and abscess samples were, however, more similar to each other than to the oral cavity microbiota. Using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that Granulicatella adiacens, Eubacterium yurii, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus mitis, and Atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples. CONCLUSIONS: We used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to characterize the microbiota associated normal and diseased oral sites in the same individuals.
TI  - Comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. We investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). By using culture-independent 16S rRNA approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. RESULTS: DGGE fingerprints showed variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. The clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria and uncultivated TM7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. In combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. Bacterial species, Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Gemella haemolysans, Gemella morbillorum, Johnsonella ignava and Streptococcus parasanguinis I were highly associated with tumor site where as Granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. Streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. CONCLUSIONS: The underlying changes in the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of OSCC subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. These most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be associated with OSCC and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.
TI  - Pasteurella canis and Granulicatella adiacens conjunctivitis outbreak resistant to empirical treatment in a child welfare agency.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate pathogens associated with bacterial conjunctivitis resistant to the empirical treatment and their antibiotic resistance in a child welfare agency. METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes in 14 children with a median age of 3 months with conjunctivitis resistant to the empirical treatment were included in this study. Samples were taken three times from the inferior fornix in both eyes using cotton swabs, cultured onto chocolate and blood agar, and prepared for Gram staining. Antibiograms were evaluated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The conjunctival culture positivity rate was 35.7% in eyes with conjunctivitis resistant to the empirical treatment. The most common isolated bacteria were Pasteurella canis (25%), penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.1%), and Granulicatella adiacens (3.6%). According to culture results, ophthalmic solutions of vancomycin (50 mg/mL) or gentamicin (30 mg/mL) were applied in eyes with positive conjunctival culture. Previously applied multiple treatments were stopped in eyes with negative conjunctival culture. All eyes improved clinically during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Because unusual pathogens may cause a conjunctivitis outbreak, physicians should not insist on empirical treatment. Taking conjunctival culture and antibiotic switching according to antibiogram may be helpful.
TI  - Endocarditis caused by nutritionally variant streptococci: a case report and literature review.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) due to Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species, previously referred to as nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), occurs rarely and is often associated with negative blood cultures. Rates of treatment failure, infection relapse and mortality are higher than those of endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci. We report a case of endocarditis caused by Granulicatella adiacens in a young man with no risk factors, who was successfully treated with surgery and combination antimicrobial chemotherapy, and provide a literature review of endocarditis attributable to these rare species of fastidious gram-positive cocci which have proven exceedingly difficult to treat, with high rates of relapse and therapeutic failure despite in vitro effective antibiotic treatment regimens. Analysis of literature revealed a high prevalence (61%) of valvular heart predisposing conditions associated with endocarditis caused by NVS, such as congenital valvular heart disease or heart valve prosthesis. On the other hand, 39% of cases showed no evidence of risk factors. Combination antimicrobial chemotherapy with penicillin and gentamicin represents the antimicrobial treatment of choice in the management of patients with IE attributable to NVS. Heart valve replacement surgery should be considered in cases of hemodynamic derangement due to significant valve destruction.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a fibronectin-binding protein from Granulicatella adiacens.
AB  - The interaction of microorganisms with fibronectin plays an important role in infective endocarditis. Granulicatella adiacens is a member of the oral microbiota, formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococci, and is often isolated from endocarditis patients. In the present study we identified a surface protein, designated Cha, which binds to fibronectin, by a plaque hybridization procedure using the cshA sequence as probe, which encodes a fibronectin-binding molecule of Streptococcus gordonii DL1. The cha sequence was highly homologous to cshA and encoded a product of 2351 amino acid residues. The protein comprised a unique sequence in the N-terminal half region. The C-terminal region contained nine complete, and one incomplete, 115-amino acid residue repeat blocks. Among eight strains of nutritionally variant streptococci, three G. adiacens strains and one Abiotrophia defectiva strain carried the cha gene. Heterologous expression studies suggested that Cha adhered to immobilized fibronectin, and that this function was located in the unique region. Recombinant Cha protein also adhered to immobilize fibronectin and partially inhibited adherence of G. adiacens to fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that Cha is a cell surface protein that mediates adherence of G. adiacens to fibronectin.
TI  - Variations of oral microbiota are associated with pancreatic diseases including pancreatic cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The associations between oral diseases and increased risk of pancreatic cancer have been reported in several prospective cohort studies. In this study, we measured variations of salivary microbiota and evaluated their potential associations with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. METHODS: This study was divided into three phases: (1) microbial profiling using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray to investigate salivary microbiota variation between 10 resectable patients with pancreatic cancer and 10 matched healthy controls, (2) identification and verification of bacterial candidates by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and (3) validation of bacterial candidates by qPCR on an independent cohort of 28 resectable pancreatic cancer, 28 matched healthy control and 27 chronic pancreatitis samples. RESULTS: Comprehensive comparison of the salivary microbiota between patients with pancreatic cancer and healthy control subjects revealed a significant variation of salivary microflora. Thirty-one bacterial species/clusters were increased in the saliva of patients with pancreatic cancer (n=10) in comparison to those of the healthy controls (n=10), whereas 25 bacterial species/clusters were decreased. Two out of six bacterial candidates (Neisseria elongata and Streptococcus mitis) were validated using the independent samples, showing significant variation (p<0.05, qPCR) between patients with pancreatic cancer and controls (n=56). Additionally, two bacteria (Granulicatella adiacens and S mitis) showed significant variation (p<0.05, qPCR) between chronic pancreatitis samples and controls (n=55). The combination of two bacterial biomarkers (N elongata and S mitis) yielded a receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve value of 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.96, p<0.0001) with a 96.4% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity in distinguishing patients with pancreatic cancer from healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The authors observed associations between variations of patients' salivary microbiota with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. This report also provides proof of salivary microbiota as an informative source for discovering non-invasive biomarkers of systemic diseases.
TI  - An unusual causative agent for an orbital abscess: Granulicatella Adiacens.
AB  - We present a patient who developed an orbital abscess secondary to a retained organic (wooden) foreign body after a fall. Clinically, he had a right sub brow fistula exuding purulent discharge, four millimetres of proptosis, limitation of ocular motility in all directions of gaze, but no signs of optic neuropathy. Preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits was performed to localise the abscess and to facilitate surgical planning. He underwent exploration, drainage of the abscess and removal of the wooden foreign body with good postoperative recovery. Cultures isolated Ganulicatella Adiacens, a nutritionally variant streptococcus. This is an unusual causative organism and to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a posttraumatic orbital abscess associated with Granulicatella Adiacens. Clinical suspicion, isolation of the organism and appropriate microbial treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, with input from the ophthalmologist, microbiologist and infectious disease team. This will ensure a good outcome in patient management.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE: This case-controlled study examined clinical and microbiological parameters in Brazilian children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment using fixed orthodontic appliances or removable orthodontic appliances. METHODS: The plaque index, gingival index, number of decayed, missing and filled teeth, and probing pocket depth was measured on each fully erupted tooth in 30 patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. The same parameters were also measured in 18 patients treated with removable orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. In the patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four teeth with orthodontic brackets and from four teeth with orthodontic bands. In the patients with removable appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from clasped maxillary permanent first molar teeth and from four unclasped permanent teeth. Samples of unstimulated whole saliva and samples from the dorsal surface of the tongue were also obtained from each subject. Each sample was analyzed for the presence of 19 target bacteria by dot blot. A subset of samples was examined by direct amplification of bacterial nucleic acids. RESULTS: Compared to their respective age and sex-matched controls, whole mouth means for plaque index and gingival index were significantly elevated in both the fixed and removable orthodontic groups. There was no difference in the DMFT. Subjects with fixed orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of each of the target species except for L. fermentum, Neisseriaceae and S. mutans. The prevalence of A. naeslundii and Streptococcus sp. was significantly higher on teeth with orthodontic brackets alone compared to teeth with both orthodontic bands and brackets. Subjects with removable orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, L. fermentum, Neisseriaceae, and spirochetes. The prevalence of Neisseriaceae was significantly higher on unclasped teeth compared to clasped teeth. There was no difference between sample sites for the target bacteria except for A. actinomycetemcomitans that was detected less frequently in saliva. Orthodontic patients demonstrated higher proportions of gram negative species by direct amplification of nucleic acids including species frequently associated with periodontal disease as well as rarely cultivable or non-cultivable species such as Abiotrophia defectiva, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lautropia sp., Terrahaemophilus aromaticivorans, and TM7 bacterium.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) accelerates identification of Gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. To accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) targeting Gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. By combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium/durans. Furthermore, the newly designed FISH probes STREP2, ENCO and GRANU targeted Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, Enterococcus spp. (except E. faecalis) and Granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. The FISH assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and reliable molecular identification of Gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.
TI  - Granulicatella adiacens breast implant-associated infection.
AB  - The 1st reported case of breast implant-associated infection due to Granulicatella adiacens, formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococci, Streptococcus adiacens, and Abiotrophia adiacens is presented. Microbiology and previously reported cases of infections by this organism are reviewed.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by nutritionally variant streptococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis caused by nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) has a higher rate of complications than endocarditis caused by other streptococci. The bacteriologic failure rate and the mortality rate are high. However, current knowledge on this disease derives from previous patient data from 1987. Recent case reports showed successful antibiotic treatment in the absence of surgery. Here, we report the clinical outcome of infective endocarditis caused by NVS in our hospital. METHODS: Data were collected by retrospective case note review. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2006, there were 8 cases of NVS endocarditis: 4 patients had infection caused by Abiotrophia defectiva and 4 patients had infection caused by Granulicatella adiacens. Vegetation size on echocardiography was large (10 mm) in 7 patients, and embolization occurred in 3 patients. Patients were treated with penicillin and gentamicin initially, and 3 of them were successfully treated. The regimens were shifted to vancomycin, teicoplanin, or cefotaxime in 2 cases because of poor therapeutic responses. A total of 4 patients underwent early valve replacement successfully because of severe heart failure. Three patients underwent mitral valve repair successfully at the time of 2, 4, and 7 months after the diagnosis of endocarditis. The valve cultures at surgery were negative. There was no mortality or relapse. The bacteriologic failure rate was zero. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment with penicillin and gentamicin had a high rate of success in patients with infective endocarditis caused by NVS. Early surgical intervention should be considered in those patients with deteriorating heart failure due to valve destruction.
TI  - Infectious intracranial aneurysms caused by Granulicatella adiacens.
AB  - Infectious intracranial aneurysms (IIAs) are uncommon but severe complications of bacterial endocarditis. We report a case of IIA due to a rare nutritionally variant streptococcus, Granulicatella adiacens. The 31-year-old young patient, without any known risk for infective endocarditis had a silent clinical course until rupture of IIAs occurred. Despite antibiotic treatment and surgical clipping of IIAs, a second episode of more severe intracerebral hemorrhage occurred four months later. Mitral valvuloplasty was undertaken and there were no more brain insults in the following four years. Awareness of the possibility of hemorrhagic stroke as the initial presentation of Granulicatella adiacens endocarditis, and the possibility of high recurrence and bacteriological failure rate of Granulicatella adiacens infection may be helpful in early diagnosis and surgical decision, thus limiting future fatal complications.
TI  - Characterization of the bacteriolytic activity of nutritionally variant streptococci.
AB  - The bacteriolytic activity of nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS), fastidious microaerophilic bacteria, which are members of the genera Abiotrophia and Granulicatella, was characterized in a renaturating SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. Bacteriolytic profiles appeared quite different for the three species of NVS examined. Granulicatella adiacens or Abiotrophia defectiva each presented at least seven lytic bands, four of which were in common, while the other three were species-specific, whereas Granulicatella elegans showed six bands, which were overlapping with the G. adiacens bands. Four lytic bands were identified for enzymatic activity; D-alanyl-L-lysine hydrolase, endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase, endoacetylmuramidase, D-glutamyl-L-lysine hydrolase and acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase activities could be defined. The bacteriolytic enzymes were purified and characterized for the kinetics of production during growth, autolytic activity, temperature and pH stability.
TI  - [Endocarditis due to Granulicatella adiacens].
AB  - CASE REPORT: A prosthetic aortic valve was implanted in a 41-year-old patient with connatal aortic stenosis. 14 months later a bacterial endocarditis was diagnosed and treated with ceftriaxone. 6 weeks later he had a relapse. Satellite streptococci could be cultivated from three blood cultures, later identified as Granulicatella adiacens. The patient was treated with penicillin and gentamicin. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE: In a short review of the literature the most important aspects of pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapy of endocarditis due to satellite streptococci are presented.
TI  - Adherence of Abiotrophia defectiva and Granulicatella species to fibronectin: is  there a link with endovascular infections?
AB  - During a 6-year period, we isolated three Abiotrophia defectiva, six Granulicatella adiacens and two G. 'para-adiacens' strains from clinical specimens. All A. defectiva strains were isolated from immunocompetent patients with endovascular infections, whereas the Granulicatella spp. strains were isolated from immunosuppressed patients with primary bacteremia. As the capacity of bacteria to adhere to the host extracellular matrix (ECM) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of endovascular infection, we investigated the ability of A. defectiva and Granulicatella spp. isolates to bind different ECM components immobilized in microtiter plates. Adherence tests showed a strong attachment of A. defectiva strains to fibronectin, whereas Granulicatella spp. strains were not adherent. The poor adherence of Granulicatella spp. strains to the ECM could be correlated with a lower propensity to induce endocarditis.
TI  - Catonella morbi and Granulicatella adiacens: new species in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study intended to examine samples from primary endodontic infections for the presence of Catonella morbi and Granulicatella adiacens, 2 species that have been recently suggested to be involved with infections in other oral sites. STUDY DESIGN: Genomic DNA was isolated directly from samples taken from teeth with different forms of apical periodontitis, and a devised culture-independent 16S rRNA gene-based heminested PCR assay was used to determine the prevalence of these 2 target species. Species-specific primers were developed by aligning closely related 16S rRNA gene sequences. Species-specificity for each primer pair was confirmed by running PCR against a panel of oral bacteria and by sequencing of DNA from representative positive samples. RESULTS: C morbi and G adiacens were detected in 33% and 19%, respectively, of the root canals associated with chronic apical periodontitis; 30% and 10%, respectively, of the cases diagnosed as acute apical periodontitis, and 16% and 11%, respectively, of the pus samples taken from acute apical abscesses. Overall, C morbi occurred in 26% and G adiacens in 14% of the samples taken from primary endodontic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that C morbi and G adiacens can take part in the microbiota associated with primary endodontic infections, and their specific role in the disease process warrants further elucidation.
TI  - Streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  - Previously, we reported that intracellular Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. In this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using the same double-labeling techniques to identify Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, oral Campylobacter species, Eikenella corrodens, Treponema denticola, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. All those species were found within buccal cells. In every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. Streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (G. adiacens). This is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.
TI  - Prosthetic valve endocarditis from Granulicatella adiacens (nutritionally variant streptococci).
AB  - Nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) are an unusual but significant cause of  endocarditis, with increased morbidity and mortality compared to those caused by enterococci or viridans streptococci. For many reasons, NVS endocarditis has remained very difficult to treat medically with antibiotics, and when the bacteria infect prosthetic valves, surgical intervention has historically been required to effect cure. We report the first case of Granulicatella adiacens prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) in a patient with congenital heart disease who was successfully treated with a regimen of vancomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin and provide the first review of the literature on NVS PVE, as well as discussion of logistics behind the use of this antibiotic regimen.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular characterization of erythromycin resistance in four isolates of Streptococcus-like gram-positive cocci causing bacteremia.
AB  - Among nine patients with bacteremia caused by Granulicatella or Gemella in a 6-year period (July 1995 to June 2001), three had bacteremia caused by erythromycin-resistant Granulicatella adiacens and one had bacteremia caused by erythromycin-resistant Gemella haemolysans. All four isolates possessed mef genes, whereas none possessed ermT, ermTR, or ermB genes.
TI  - Identification and characterization of bacterial-binding property in the type III repeat domain of fibronectin.
AB  - To characterize fibronectin binding with Granulicatella adiacens, a causative agent of infective endocarditis, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human fibronectin and selected for their capacity to inhibit the fibronectin binding of the organism. Thermolysin and lysyl-endopeptidase digests of fibronectin were characterized by Western blot. The epitope of inhibitory monoclonal antibody was found in the central portion of fibronectin known as the cell-binding domain, and not in the N-terminal portion known to be the binding region of most microbial species, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. While these two species could bind to both the N-terminal and central portion, Escherichia coli and G. adiacens bind only to the latter. Excess amounts of free fibronectin in the solution inhibited the bacterial adherence to the N-terminal fibronectin fragment, but not to the central region, thereby suggesting the central region plays a significant role for in vivo bacterial colonization in the presence of high concentrations of soluble fibronectin.
TI  - Central nervous system infections due to Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species:  an emerging challenge?
AB  - Although Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species, previously referred to as nutritionally variant streptococci, were initially identified over 40 years ago, isolation of these pathogens from the central nervous system (CNS) was first noted only recently. Recognition of CNS involvement with these organisms is of great concern given the association of Abiotrophia/Granulicatella infections with increased morbidity and mortality as well as greater bacteriologic failure and relapse rates. We describe A. defectiva and G. adiacens CNS infections in two patients and review the existing literature of CNS involvement with these bacteria. The clinical presentation and initial cerebrospinal fluid analysis has varied substantially across reported patients. While most infections have been characterized primarily by a localized infection (e.g., abscess), evidence of meningitis has usually also been present. Furthermore, nearly all cases have followed neurosurgical procedures suggesting possible introduction of the organism into the CNS at the time of surgery. Given the significant negative clinical impact of Abiotrophia/Granulicatella infections, elucidation of the emerging epidemiology of CNS infections with these bacteria is warranted.
TI  - "Streptococcus milleri" endocarditis caused by Streptococcus anginosus.
AB  - Unlike other viridans streptococci, members of the "Streptococcus milleri group"  are often associated with abscess formation, but are only rare causes of infective endocarditis. Although it has been shown that almost all S. intermedius isolates and most S. constellatus isolates, but only 19% of S. anginosus isolates, were associated with abscess formation, no report has addressed the relative importance of the 3 species of the "S. milleri group" in infective endocarditis. During a 5-year period (April 1997 through March 2002), 6 cases of "S. milleri" endocarditis (out of 377 cases of infective endocarditis), that fulfil the Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, were encountered. All 6 "S. milleri" isolates were identified as S. anginosus by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Three patients had underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease and 1 was an IV drug abuser. Five had monomicrobial bacteremia, and 1 had polymicrobial (S. anginosus, S. mitis, Granulicatella adiacens, and Slackia exigua) bacteremia. Two patients died. None of the 6 isolates were identified by the Vitek system (GPI) or the API system (20 STREP) at >95% confidence. All 6 isolates were sensitive to penicillin G (MIC 0.008-0.064 microg/mL), cefalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Accurate identification to the species level, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, in cases of bacteremia caused by members of the "S. milleri group", would have direct implication on the underlying disease process, hence guiding diagnosis and treatment. Infective endocarditis should be actively looked for in cases of monomicrobial S. anginosus bacteremia, especially if the organism is recovered in multiple blood cultures.
TI  - Inhibition of fibronectin binding of some bacterial cells by subtle pH increase within the physiological range.
AB  - The fibronectin (Fn)-binding ability of microorganisms is considered to be involved in their pathogenicities. Granulicatella adiacens, a member of the oral flora and a causative agent of culture-negative infective endocarditis, showed nearly maximum binding to immobilized Fn at pH 7.2 but greatly reduced binding at a slightly higher pH 7.4 and almost no binding at pH 7.6 in the presence of physiological concentration of NaCl (0.15 M). A similar pH-sensitive Fn-binding property was noted with Escherichia coli and Abiotrophia defectiva, but not with Streptococcus pyogenes nor Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, bindings to laminin and fibrinogen observed for some of these strains were unaffected by the same pH changes. This fastidious pH-dependency of Fn-binding abilities of some bacteria warns that the pH condition must be seriously considered in the in vitro assay of bacterial adherence to fibronectin.
TI  - Septic arthritis caused by Granulicatella adiacens: diagnosis by inoculation of synovial fluid into blood culture bottles.
AB  - Granulicatella species, formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococci, cause a variety of infections, primarily endocarditis. We report the first culture-proven case of a Granulicatella species causing septic arthritis. A 68-year-old female presented with knee pain and swelling. She was initially evaluated with arthrocentesis and arthroscopy, but no organism was identified. Her pain improved after a brief course of antibiotics but recurred 3 months later. She underwent repeat arthrocentesis, with direct inoculation of synovial fluid into blood culture bottles. Granulicatella adiacens was recovered from both bottles. She was treated with cefazolin for 4 weeks combined with gentamicin for the first 2 weeks. Her knee pain and swelling resolved without evidence of recurrence. Granulicatella should be considered in cases of septic arthritis with initially negative synovial fluid cultures. Inoculation of blood cultures bottles with synovial fluid may increase the diagnostic yield for these species.
TI  - Granulicatella adiacens and Abiotrophia defectiva bacteraemia characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Traditionally, the identification, epidemiology and spectrum of clinical diseases caused by Granulicatella adiacens and Abiotrophia defectiva are dependent upon their phenotypic characterization. During a 6-year period (July 1995-June 2001), seven and two alpha-haemolytic streptococci were identified as G. adiacens and A. defectiva, respectively, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Three patients with haematological malignancies and neutropenic fever had primary bacteraemia. Three patients with valvular problems or congenital heart disease had infective endocarditis. A patient with ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular accident had infected aortic atheroma with dissection. A patient with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis had acute cholangitis and a patient with polypoid cystitis and benign prostatic hypertrophy had acute prostatitis. Four of the nine patients died, including all three with G. adiacens infective endocarditis or infected atheroma. For the seven G. adiacens isolates, the API 20 STREP system successfully identified one and five isolates as G. adiacens with >95 % and 80-90 % confidence, respectively, whereas the Vitek System (GPI) and ATB Expression system (ID32 STREP) successfully identified none and one isolate as G. adiacens. Of the two A. defectiva isolates, none of the three systems successfully identified either of them as A. defectiva. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is the technique of choice for identifying G. adiacens and A. defectiva, and early surgical intervention should be considered when G. adiacens endocarditis is diagnosed.
TI  - Serological properties of Abiotrophia and Granulicatella species (nutritionally variant streptococci).
AB  - Serological variations were examined among 12 type or reference strains and 91 oral isolates of vitamin B6-dependent Abiotrophia and Granulicatella spp. Rabbits were immunized with whole cells of 12 selected strains and 10 typing antisera were obtained, which were unreactive with the Lancefield group A to G antigen preparations. The reactivity of the antisera and autoclaved cell surface antigen extracts was tested by double diffusion in agar gel and a capillary precipitin test. These typing antisera categorized all Abiotrophia defectiva strains, all except one Granulicatella elegans strain, three-quarters of the Granulicatella adiacens, and half of the Granulicatella paraadiacens into 8 serotypes and 2 subserotypes. The Granulicatella balaenopterae type strain was unserotypable. All A. defectiva strains were serotype I, some of which were divided into subserotype I-1 and/or I-5. The G. adiacens strains generally belonged to serotype II or III, and the G. paraadiacens strains to serotype IV, V or VI. All G. adiacens or G. paraadiacens serotype II strains were also subserotype I-5. The G. elegans strains were serotype VII or VIII. These Abiotrophia and Granulicatella serotypes were undetectable among 33 strains of the other 11 species including the bacteriolytic enzyme-producing but vitamin B6-independent strains of Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Dolosigranulum and Aerococcus. The proposed serotyping system for Abiotrophia and Granulicatella spp. would be helpful in the identification and classification of these unique coccal isolates in ecological and epidemiological studies.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Abiotrophia adiacens and Abiotrophia defectiva.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 27 Abiotrophia adiacens (proposed reclassification Granulicatella adiacens comb.nov., Collins & Lawson, 2000) and 12 Abiotrophia defectiva isolates were tested by microdilution in pyridoxal hydrochloride and lysed horse blood supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth. According to NCCLS interpretative criteria for Streptococcus spp. not Streptococcus pneumoniae, the susceptibilities of A. adiacens and A. defectiva were, respectively: penicillin, 55% and 8%; amoxicillin, 81% and 92%; ceftriaxone, 63% and 83%; meropenem, 96% and 100%; and 100% for both species with clindamycin, rifampin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and vancomycin.
