TI  == diversity of the intestinal bacteria of cattle fed on diets with different doses  of gelatinized starch-urea.
AB  == gelatinized starch-urea (starea, su) is an effective and economical source of urea for ruminants. here we assessed the influence of dietary supplementation with gelatinized starch-urea on the diversity of intestinal bacteria in finishing cattle. fifty steers were randomly allotted to five treatments with diets supplemented with different doses of starea [0 % (su0), 8 % (su8), 16 % (su16), 24 % (su24), and 32 % (su32) of urea-n in total nitrogen]. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes was used to examine the effect of dietary supplementation of starea on intestinal bacterial flora. shannon-weaver and simpson diversity indices consistently showed the lowest bacterial diversity  in the su0 treatment. increasing doses of starea increased the diversity up to su24 after which, diversity decreased. cluster analysis of 16s rrna gene dgge profiles indicates that the intestinal bacterial communities associated with cattle that were not supplemented with starea in feed differed in composition and structure from those supplemented with starea. the amount of starea supplemented  in cattle diets influenced the abundance of several key species affiliated with lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, peptostreptococcaceae, comamonadaceae and moraxellaceae. these results suggest that starea influences the composition and structure of intestinal bacteria which may play a role in promoting ruminant health and production performance.

TI  == gut microbiota: its role in hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == ammonia, a key factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (he), is predominantly derived from urea breakdown by urease producing large intestinal bacteria and from small intestine and kidneys, where the enzyme glutaminases releases ammonia from circulating glutamine. non-culture techniques like pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid are used to characterize fecal microbiota. fecal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis have been shown to alter with increasing child-turcotte-pugh (ctp) and model for end stage liver disease (meld) scores, and with development of covert or overt he. cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (cdr), the ratio of autochthonous/good bacteria (e.g. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae and clostridiales) to non-autochthonous/pathogenic bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae and streptococcaceae), is significantly higher in controls and patients with compensated cirrhosis than patients with decompensated cirrhosis. although their  stool microbiota do not differ, sigmoid colonic mucosal microbiota in liver cirrhosis patients with and without he, are different. linkage of pathogenic colonic mucosal bacteria with poor cognition and inflammation suggests that important processes at the mucosal interface, such as bacterial translocation and immune dysfunction, are involved in the pathogenesis of he. fecal microbiome composition does not change significantly when he is treated with lactulose or when he recurs after lactulose withdrawal. despite improving cognition and endotoxemia as well as shifting positive correlation of pathogenic bacteria with  metabolites, linked to ammonia, aromatic amino acids and oxidative stress, to a negative correlation, rifaximin changes gut microbiome composition only modestly. these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of lactulose and rifaximin could be associated with a change in microbial metabolic function as well as an improvement in dysbiosis.

TI  == urinary microbiota in patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
AB  == introduction: inflammation is associated with promotion of the initiation of various malignancies, partly due to bacterial infection-induced microenvironmental changes. however, the exact association between microbiota in  urine, seminal fluid and the expressed prostatic secretions and benign prostatic  hypertrophy and prostate cancer is not clear. material and methods: in the present study, we investigated the type of microbiota in the expressed prostatic  secretions (eps) of patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) by the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) method using universal bacterial primers. in order to  understand the possible association between various bacteria and prostate cancer, quantitative real-time pcr assay was performed to quantify the amount of strains  of bacteria in urine, eps and seminal fluid. results: the prostate cancer group had a significantly increased number of bacteroidetes bacteria, alphaproteobacteria, firmicutes bacteria, lachnospiraceae, propionicimonas, sphingomonas, and ochrobactrum, and a decrease in eubacterium and defluviicoccus  compared to the bph group. the number of escherichia coli in the prostate cancer  group was significantly decreased in urine and increased in the eps and seminal fluid, while the number of enterococcus was significantly increased in the seminal fluid with little change in urine and eps. conclusions: based on these results, we suggest that there are significant changes in the microbial population in eps, urine and seminal fluid of subjects with prostate cancer and bph, indicating a possible role for these bacteria in these two conditions.

TI  == gut metabolites and bacterial community networks during a pilot intervention study with flaxseeds in healthy adult men.
AB  == scope: flaxseeds contain the phytoestrogens lignans that must be activated to enterolignans by intestinal bacteria. we investigated the impact of flaxseeds on  fecal bacterial communities and their associations with fecal and blood metabolites. methods and results: nine healthy male adult subjects ingested 0.3 g/kg/day flaxseeds during 1 week. gut bacteria as well as blood and fecal metabolites were analyzed. ingestion of flaxseeds triggered a significant increase in the blood concentration of enterolignans, accompanied by fecal excretion of propionate and glycerol. overall diversity and composition of dominant fecal bacteria remained individual specific throughout the study. enterolactone production was linked to the abundance of two molecular species identified as ruminococcus bromii and ruminococcus lactaris. most dominant species of the order bacteroidales were positively associated with fecal concentrations of either acetic, isovaleric, or isobutyric acid, the latter being negatively correlated with blood levels of triglycerides. the relative sequence abundance of one gemmiger species (ruminococcaceae) and of coprococcus comes (lachnospiraceae) correlated positively with blood levels of ldl cholesterol and  triglycerides, respectively. conclusion: flaxseeds increase enterolignan production but do not markedly alter fecal metabolome and dominant bacterial communities. the data underline the possible role of members of the family ruminococcaceae in the regulation of enterolignan production and blood lipids.

TI  == a novel microbial source tracking microarray for pathogen detection and fecal source identification in environmental systems.
AB  == pathogen detection and the identification of fecal contamination sources are challenging in environmental waters. factors including pathogen diversity and ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria hamper risk assessment and remediation of contamination sources. a custom microarray targeting pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), microbial source tracking (mst) markers, and antibiotic resistance genes was tested against dna obtained from whole genome amplification  (wga) of rna and dna from sewage and animal (avian, cattle, poultry, and swine) feces. perfect and mismatch probes established the specificity of the microarray  in sewage, and fluorescence decrease of positive probes over a 1:10 dilution series demonstrated semiquantitative measurement. pathogens, including norovirus, campylobacter fetus, helicobacter pylori, salmonella enterica, and giardia lamblia were detected in sewage, as well as mst markers and resistance genes to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and tetracycline. sensitivity (percentage true positives) of mst results in sewage and animal waste samples (21-33%) was lower than specificity (83-90%, percentage of true negatives). next generation dna sequencing revealed two dominant bacterial families that were common to all sample types: ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae. five dominant phyla and 15 dominant families comprised 97% and 74%, respectively, of sequences from all fecal sources. phyla and families not represented on the microarray are possible  candidates for inclusion in subsequent array designs.

TI  == essential oils affect populations of some rumen bacteria in vitro as revealed by  microarray (rumenbactarray) analysis.
AB  == in a previous study origanum oil (oro), garlic oil (gao), and peppermint oil (peo) were shown to effectively lower methane production, decrease abundance of methanogens, and change abundances of several bacterial populations important to  feed digestion in vitro. in this study, the impact of these essential oils (eos,  at 0.50 g/l) on the rumen bacterial community composition and population was further examined using the recently developed rumenbactarray. species richness (expressed as number of operational taxonomic units, otus) in the phylum firmicutes, especially those in the class clostridia, was decreased by oro and gao, but increased by peo, while that in the phylum bacteroidetes was increased by oro and peo. species richness in the genus butyrivibrio was lowered by all the eos. increases of bacteroidetes otus mainly resulted from increases of prevotella otus. overall, 67 individual otus showed significant differences (p </= 0.05) in  relative abundance across the eo treatments. the predominant otus affected by eos were diverse, including those related to syntrophococcus sucromutans, succiniclasticum ruminis, and lachnobacterium bovis, and those classified to prevotella, clostridium, roseburia, pseudobutyrivibrio, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, prevotellaceae, bacteroidales, and clostridiales. in total, 60 otus were found significantly (p </= 0.05) correlated with feed degradability, ammonia concentration, and molar percentage of volatile fatty acids. taken together, this study demonstrated extensive impact of eos on rumen bacterial communities in an eo type-dependent manner, especially those in the predominant families prevotellaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae. the information from this study may aid in understanding the effect of eos on feed digestion and  fermentation by rumen bacteria.

TI  == effect of donor animal species and their feeding on the composition of the microbial community establishing in a rumen simulation.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of donor animal species and their feeding on the  composition of the active fraction of rumen microbiota established during in vitro experiments with different forages. methods and results: rumen simulation experiments were conducted with maize silage (ms) and grass silage (gs) as substrates. four experimental runs were performed with ruminal contents of sheep  and cows fed either with hay and concentrate or with ms or gs, respectively. liquid- and solid-associated microbes (lam and sam) were fixed for fluorescence in situ hybridization after 14 days of incubation. the lam were characterized by  higher proportions of lachnospiraceae, bacteroidetes, deltaproteobacteria and methanobacteriaceae at hay-concentrate-based feeding of the donor animals whereas counts of gammaproteobacteria were lower. similar results were found for sam. hay-concentrate-based feeding caused a higher ratio of bacteria:archaea in sam. incubations with gs seemed to enhance bacteroidetes, deltaproteobacteria and archaea whereas numbers of gammaproteobacteria were enhanced in ms experiments. the effect of the donor animal species was limited to the number of archaea establishing in vitro being higher for sheep than for cows. conclusions: the feeding of donor animals, more than the animal species itself, affects the composition of the ruminal microbial community that establishes in vitro. significance and impact of the study: data suggest the need of a standardized approach for studying the rumen microbiota in a rumen simulation. moreover, this  study provides fundamental data on the composition of the ruminal microbial community when different diets are fed to donor animals.

TI  == herbinix hemicellulosilytica, gen. nov., sp. nov., a thermophilic cellulose-degrading bacterium isolated from a thermophilic biogas reactor.
AB  == phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on new isolates of a novel gram-positive, anaerobic, non sporulating rod-shaped bacterium isolated from a thermophilic biogas plant. the novel organisms were able to degrade crystalline cellulose. 16s rrna gene comparative sequence analysis demonstrated that the isolates formed a hitherto unknown subline within the family lachnospiraceae. as  a representative of the whole group of isolates, strain t3/55t was further characterized. the closest relative of t3/55t among the validly described taxa is mobilitalea sibirica, sharing 93.9% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. strain t3/55t was catalase-negative, indole-negative, and produced acetate, ethanol, and propionic acid as major end products from cellulose metabolism. the major cellular fatty acids (>1%) were 16:0 dimethyl acetal, 16:0 fatty acid methyl ester and 16:0 aldehyde. the dna g + c content was 36.6 mol%. a novel genus and species, herbinix hemicellulosilytica gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed based on phylogenetic analysis and physiological properties of the novel isolate. strain t3/55t (=dsm 29228t = cect 8801t), represents the type strain for the novel genus and novel species herbinix hemicellulosilytica.

TI  == is there interaction between gut microbial profile and cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease patients?
AB  == aim: to evaluate the gut microbial profile in chronic kidney disease (ckd) patients and evaluate the possible relationship with inflammation and cardiovascular risk. patients & methods: markers inflammation plasma and bacterial community profile (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) were analyzed. results: the average number of bands was not different in healthy individuals and ckd patients. the number of bands was negatively associated with  plasma levels of vcam-1 in patients. flavobacteriaceae bacterium and listeria monocytogenes were found in patients and lachnospiraceae bacterium and butyrivibrio crossotus in healthy individuals. conclusion: although ckd patients  did not present altered gut microbial profile, the sequencing of bands suggested  a different microbiota between groups. the result suggests a possible relationship between gut microbiota and cardiovascular risk in ckd patients.

TI  == identification and functional expression of genes encoding flavonoid o- and c-glycosidases in intestinal bacteria.
AB  == gut bacteria play a crucial role in the metabolism of dietary flavonoids and thereby influence the bioactivity of these compounds in the host. the intestinal  lachnospiraceae strain cg19-1 and eubacterium cellulosolvens are able to deglycosylate c- and o-coupled flavonoid glucosides. growth of strain cg19-1 in the presence of the isoflavone c-glucoside puerarin (daidzein 8-c-glucoside) led  to the induction of two proteins (dfgc, dfgd). heterologous expression of the encoding genes (dfgc, dfgd) in escherichia coli revealed no c-deglycosylating activity in the resulting cell extracts but cleavage of flavonoid o-glucosides such as daidzin (daidzein 7-o-glucoside). the recombinant dfgc and dfgd proteins  were purified and characterized with respect to their quaternary structure, substrate and cofactor specificity. the products of the corresponding genes (dfgc, dfgd) from e. cellulosolvens also catalysed the o-deglycosylation of daidzin following their expression in e. coli. in combination with three recombinant proteins encoded by adjacent genes in e. cellulosolvens (dfga, dfgb,  dfge), dfgc and dfgd from e. cellulosolvens catalysed the deglycosylation of the  flavone c-glucosides homoorientin (luteolin 6-c-glucoside) and isovitexin (apigenin 6-c-glucoside). even intact cells of e. coli expressing the five e. cellulosolvens genes cleaved these flavone c-glucosides and, also, flavonoid o-glucosides to the corresponding aglycones.

TI  == sewage reflects the microbiomes of human populations.
AB  == molecular characterizations of the gut microbiome from individual human stool samples have identified community patterns that correlate with age, disease, diet, and other human characteristics, but resources for marker gene studies that consider microbiome trends among human populations scale with the number of individuals sampled from each population. as an alternative strategy for sampling populations, we examined whether sewage accurately reflects the microbial community of a mixture of stool samples. we used oligotyping of high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequence data to compare the bacterial distribution in a stool data set to a sewage influent data set from 71 u.s. cities. on average, only 15% of sewage sample sequence reads were attributed to human fecal origin, but sewage recaptured most (97%) human fecal oligotypes. the most common oligotypes in stool matched the most common and abundant in sewage. after informatically separating sequences of human fecal origin, sewage samples exhibited ~3x greater diversity than stool samples. comparisons among municipal sewage communities revealed the ubiquitous and abundant occurrence of 27 human fecal oligotypes, representing an  apparent core set of organisms in u.s. populations. the fecal community variability among u.s. populations was significantly lower than among individuals. it clustered into three primary community structures distinguished by oligotypes from either: bacteroidaceae, prevotellaceae, or lachnospiraceae/ruminococcaceae. these distribution patterns reflected human population variation and predicted whether samples represented lean or obese populations with 81 to 89% accuracy. our findings demonstrate that sewage represents the fecal microbial community of human populations and captures population-level traits of the human microbiome. importance: the gut microbiota serves important functions in healthy humans. numerous projects aim to define a healthy gut microbiome and its association with health states. however, financial considerations and privacy concerns limit the number of individuals who can be screened. by analyzing sewage from 71 cities, we demonstrate that geographically  distributed u.s. populations share a small set of bacteria whose members represent various common community states within u.s. adults. cities were differentiated by their sewage bacterial communities, and the community structures were good predictors of a city's estimated level of obesity. our approach demonstrates the use of sewage as a means to sample the fecal microbiota from millions of people and its potential to elucidate microbiome patterns associated with human demographics.

TI  == whole grain oats improve insulin sensitivity and plasma cholesterol profile and modify gut microbiota composition in c57bl/6j mice.
AB  == background: whole grain consumption reduces the risk of major chronic diseases. it is not clear how whole grains exert their beneficial effects. objective: the aim was to compare the physiologic effects of whole grain oat (wgo) flour with low bran oat (lbo) flour. methods: two ain-93g-based diets were formulated with either wgo or lbo flour. five-week-old male c57bl/6j mice were fed lbo (n = 11) and wgo (n = 13) diets for 8 wk. cecal microbiota was profiled by pyrosequencing  of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. data are reported as means +/- sems or antilogs of the mean (mean - sem, mean + sem). results: the weight gain was 14.6% less in the wgo group during week 7 (p = 0.04). wgo improved insulin sensitivity as reflected by significantly lower plasma insulin [1500 (1370, 1650) ng/l vs. 2340 (2090, 2620) ng/l; p = 0.006], c-peptide (3980 +/- 548 ng/l vs. 7340 +/- 1050 ng/l; p =  0.007), and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (21.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 34.7 +/- 4.9; p = 0.03). plasma total cholesterol was 9.9% less and non-hdl cholesterol was 11% less in the wgo group. a comparison of relative abundance indicated prevotellaceae, lactobacillaceae, and alcaligenaceae families were 175.5% (p = 0.03), 184.5% (p = 0.01), and 150.0% (p = 0.004), respectively,  greater in the wgo group and clostridiaceae and lachnospiraceae families were 527% (p = 0.004) and 62.6% (p = 0.01), respectively, greater in the lbo group. cecal microbiota composition predicts 63.9% variation in plasma insulin and 88.9% variation in plasma non-hdl cholesterol. conclusions: in mice, wgos improved insulin sensitivity and plasma cholesterol profile compared with lbos, and the effects were associated with the changes in cecal microbiota composition. increasing wgo consumption may help improve insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia  in chronic diseases.

TI  == intestinal microbial dysbiosis and colonic epithelial cell hyperproliferation by  dietary alpha-mangostin is independent of mouse strain.
AB  == beverages and supplements prepared from mangosteen fruit are claimed to support gut health and immunity, despite the absence of supporting evidence from clinical trials. we recently reported that alpha-mangostin (alpha-mg), the most abundant xanthone in mangosteen fruit, altered the intestinal microbiome, promoted dysbiosis, and exacerbated colitis in c57bl/6j mice. the objective of this study  was to determine whether induction of dysbiosis by dietary alpha-mg is limited to the c57bl/6j strain or represents a more generic response to chronic intake of the xanthone on the gut microbiota of mice. c3h, balb/c, nude foxn1nu, and c57bl/6j mice, each demonstrating unique microbiomes, were fed standard diet or diet containing 0.1% alpha-mg for four weeks. dietary alpha-mg significantly altered the cecal and colonic microbiota in all four strains of mice, promoting a reduction in generally assumed beneficial bacterial groups while increasing the abundance of pathogenic bacteria. consumption of alpha-mg was associated with reduced abundance of firmicutes and increased abundance of proteobacteria. the abundance of lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and lactobacillaceae was reduced in alpha-mg-fed mice, while that of enterobacteriaceae and enterococcaceae was increased. dietary alpha-mg also was associated with increased proliferation of colonic epithelial cells, infiltration of immune cells, infiltration of immune cells and increased fluid content in stool. these results suggest that ingestion  of pharmacologic doses of xanthones in mangosteen-containing supplements may adversely alter the gut microbiota and should be used with caution.

TI  == methanogenic food web in the gut contents of methane-emitting earthworm eudrilus  eugeniae from brazil.
AB  == the anoxic saccharide-rich conditions of the earthworm gut provide an ideal transient habitat for ingested microbes capable of anaerobiosis. it was recently  discovered that the earthworm eudrilus eugeniae from brazil can emit methane (ch4) and that ingested methanogens might be associated with this emission. the objective of this study was to resolve trophic interactions of bacteria and methanogens in the methanogenic food web in the gut contents of e. eugeniae. rna-based stable isotope probing of bacterial 16s rrna as well as mcra and mrta (the alpha subunit of methyl-com reductase and its isoenzyme, respectively) of methanogens was performed with [13c]-glucose as a model saccharide in the gut contents. concomitant fermentations were augmented by the rapid consumption of glucose, yielding numerous products, including molecular hydrogen (h2), carbon dioxide (co2), formate, acetate, ethanol, lactate, succinate and propionate. aeromonadaceae-affiliated facultative aerobes, and obligate anaerobes affiliated  to lachnospiraceae, veillonellaceae and ruminococcaceae were associated with the  diverse fermentations. methanogenesis was ongoing during incubations, and 13c-labeling of ch4 verified that supplemental [13c]-glucose derived carbon was dissimilated to ch4. hydrogenotrophic methanogens affiliated with methanobacteriaceae and methanoregulaceae were linked to methanogenesis, and acetogens related to peptostreptoccocaceae were likewise found to be participants in the methanogenic food web. h2 rather than acetate stimulated methanogenesis in the methanogenic gut content enrichments, and acetogens appeared to dissimilate supplemental h2 to acetate in methanogenic enrichments. these findings provide insight on the processes and associated taxa potentially linked to methanogenesis and the turnover of organic carbon in the alimentary canal of methane-emitting e. eugeniae.the isme journal advance online publication, 23 january 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2014.262.

TI  == murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov., an acetate-producing bacterium of the family lachnospiraceae isolated from the mouse gut.
AB  == three strains of an anaerobic, gram-stain-positive coccobacillus were isolated from the intestines of mice. these strains shared 100 % similarity in their 16s rrna gene sequences, but were distantly related to any described members of the family lachnospiraceae (<94 %). the most closely related species with names that  have standing in nomenclature were robinsoniella peoriensis, ruminococcus gnavus, blautia producta and clostridium xylanolyticum. phylogenetic relationships based  on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis were confirmed by partial sequencing of hsp60  genes. the use of an in-house database search pipeline revealed that the new isolates are most prevalent in bovine gut samples when compared with human and mouse samples for ruminococcus gnavus and b. producta. all three isolated strains shared similar cellular fatty acid patterns dominated by c16 : 0 methyl ester. differences in the proportions of c12 : 0 methyl ester, c14 : 0 methyl ester and  c18 : 1 cis-11 dimethyl acetal were observed when compared with phylogenetically  neighbouring species. the major short-chain fatty acid produced by strain srb-530-5-h(t) was acetic acid. this strain tested positive for utilization of d-fructose, d-galacturonic acid, d-malic acid, l-alanyl l-threonine and l-glutamic acid but was negative for utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, alpha-d-glucose, 3-methyl d-glucose and salicin, in contrast to the type strain of the closest related species robinsoniella peoriensis. the isolates were not able to use mannitol for growth. based on genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, we propose to create the new genus and species murimonas intestini gen. nov., sp. nov. to accommodate the three strains srb-530-5-h(t) ( = dsm 26524(t) = ccug 63391(t)) (the type strain of murimonas intestini), srb-509-4-s-h ( = dsm 27577 = ccug 64595) and srb-524-4-s-h ( = dsm 27578 = ccug 64594).

TI  == reclassification of ruminococcus obeum as blautia obeum comb. nov.
AB  == during our previous studies we reclassified clostridium coccoides and a number of misclassified ruminococci into a novel genus blautia within the family lachnospiraceae. however, the rules of the bacteriological code currently require that the types of all species and subspecies with new names (including new combinations) be deposited in two different collections in two different countries. the type strain of ruminococcus obeum was, at that period in time, only deposited in the american type culture collection (atcc) and a second independent deposit, as required by the code, was not available. consequently, the transfer of this species to the genus blautia could not be made, because the  resulting species name would not conform to the rules governing the valid publication of species names and deposit of type material (rules 27 and 30) and consequently would not be considered to be validly published. this resulted in a  nomenclatural and taxonomic anomaly with r. obeum being phylogenetically placed among members of the genus blautia with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of between 91.8 and 96.6 %. in order to rectify this unsatisfactory situation, through our discussions with the atcc, the deposit of strain r. obeum atcc 29174(t) to the dsmz as strain number dsm 25238(t) was completed. hence, the transfer of r. obeum to the genus blautia as blautia obeum comb. nov. is now proposed. the type strain is atcc 29174(t) ( = dsm 25238(t) = kctc 15206(t)).

TI  == microbiota alterations in acute and chronic gastrointestinal inflammation of cats and dogs.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota is the collection of the living microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses) inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. novel bacterial identification approaches have revealed that the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs and cats is, similarly to humans, a highly complex ecosystem.  studies in dogs and cats have demonstrated that acute and chronic gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), are associated with alterations in the small intestinal and fecal microbial communities. of interest is that these alterations are generally similar to the dysbiosis observed in humans with ibd or animal models of intestinal inflammation, suggesting that microbial responses to inflammatory conditions of the gut are conserved across mammalian host types. studies have also revealed possible underlying susceptibilities in the innate immune system of dogs and cats with ibd, which further demonstrate the intricate relationship between gut microbiota and host health. commonly identified microbiome changes in ibd are decreases in bacterial groups within the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and  increases within proteobacteia. furthermore, a reduction in the diversity of clostridium clusters xiva and iv (i.e., lachnospiraceae and clostridium coccoides subgroups) are associated with ibd, suggesting that these bacterial groups may play an important role in maintenance of gastrointestinal health. future studies  are warranted to evaluate the functional changes associated with intestinal dysbiosis in dogs and cats.

TI  == altered microbiota associated with abnormal humoral immune responses to commensal organisms in enthesitis-related arthritis.
AB  == introduction: prior studies have established altered microbiota and immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (spa), we hypothesized that spa patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.  methods: stool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (era) and non-inflammatory controls. dna purified from stool was subject to pcr amplification and sequencing of the variable iv region from the 16s rdna gene. iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects. results:  twenty-five children with era and 13 controls were included. the era patients had less faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, p = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, p = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, p = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in bacteroides (21% versus 11%, p = 0.150). akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (>2%) in 7/27 era patients but none of the controls (p = 0.072.) cluster analysis revealed two clusters of era patients: cluster one (n =  8) was characterized by high levels of bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls. seven of 17 (41%) of the era subjects in cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in cluster 1 had abundant akkermansia muciniphila (p = 0.057). serum iga and igg antibody levels against f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides were compared individually against iga antibody levels recognizing f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: the  abundance of f. prausnitzii in the stool among patients with era is reduced compared to controls, and bacteroides and a. muciniphila are identified as associative agents in subsets of era patients. differences in the humoral responses to these bacteria may contribute to disease.

TI  == effect of stoned olive pomace on rumen microbial communities and polyunsaturated  fatty acid biohydrogenation: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: stoned olive pomace (sop), which represents approximately 50% of the  conversion process of olives to olive oil, is largely not utilised and creates costs for its disposal and has negative environmental impacts. in vitro trial experiments were employed to study the effect of feeds integrated with this bio-waste, which is rich in polyphenols, on rumen biohydrogenation, using sheep rumen liquor as inoculum. results: fatty acid (fa) analysis and a polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) approach aimed  at characterising the microbial community indicated that including sop in feeds at the level of 50 g/kg and 90 g/kg induced changes in the fa profile and microbial populations. the simultaneous decrease of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus  and accumulation of vaccenic acid was observed. a depression in the populations of neisseria weaveri, ruminobacter amylophilus and other unclassified bacteria related to members of the lachnospiraceae and pasteurellaceae families was detected, suggesting that these microbial groups may be involved in rumen biohydrogenation. conclusions: supplementation of feeds with sop alters the rumen bacterial community, including bacteria responsible for the hydrogenation of vaccenic acid to stearic acid, thereby modifying the fa profile of the rumen liquor. hence, a use of sop aimed to produce meat or dairy products enriched in functional lipids can be hypothesised.

AB  == objective. ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a common highly heritable immune mediated arthropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals exposed to an unknown but likely ubiquitous environmental trigger. there is a close relationship between the gut and spa, exemplified in reactive arthritis patients  where a typically self-limiting arthropathy follows either gastrointestinal or urogenital infection. microbial involvement has been suggested in as, however, no definitive link has been established. we sought to determine if the as gut carries a distinct microbial signature, in comparison to healthy controls (hc). methods. microbial profiles from terminal ileal (ti) biopsies from subjects with  recent-onset, tnf-antagonist naive as and hc, were generated using culture-independent 16s rrna gene sequencing and analysis techniques. results. our results show the ti microbial communities of patients with as differ significantly (p<0.001) from hc, driven by higher abundance of five families of bacteria lachnospiraceae (p=0.001), veillonellaceae (p=0.01), prevotellaceae (p=0.004), porphyromonadaceae (p=0.001), and bacteroidaceae (p=0.001); two of which, lachnospiracecae, and prevotellaceace, have been strongly associated with  colitis and cd. conclusions. we show evidence for a discrete microbial signature  in the ti of cases with as compared to hc. the microbial composition was found to correlate with disease status and greater differences were observed between than  within disease groups. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that genes associated with as act at least in part through effects on the gut microbiome. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == faecal microbiota of forage-fed horses in new zealand and the population dynamics of microbial communities following dietary change.
AB  == the effects of abrupt dietary transition on the faecal microbiota of forage-fed horses over a 3-week period were investigated. yearling thoroughbred fillies reared as a cohort were exclusively fed on either an ensiled conserved forage-grain diet ("group a"; n = 6) or pasture ("group b"; n = 6) for three weeks prior to the study. after the day 0 faecal samples were collected, horses of group a were abruptly transitioned to pasture. both groups continued to graze  similar pasture for three weeks, with faecal samples collected at 4-day intervals. dna was isolated from the faeces and microbial 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicons were generated and analysed by pyrosequencing. the faecal bacterial communities of both groups of horses were highly diverse (simpson's index of diversity > 0.8), with differences between the two groups on day 0 (p < 0.017 adjusted for multiple comparisons). there were differences between groups a and b in the relative abundances of four genera, bf311 (family bacteroidaceae; p = 0.003), cf231 (family paraprevotellaceae; p = 0.004), and currently unclassified  members within the order clostridiales (p = 0.003) and within the family lachnospiraceae (p = 0.006). the bacterial community of group a horses became similar to group b within four days of feeding on pasture, whereas the structure  of the archaeal community remained constant pre- and post-dietary change. the community structure of the faecal microbiota (bacteria, archaea and ciliate protozoa) of pasture-fed horses was also identified. the initial differences observed appeared to be linked to recent dietary history, with the bacterial community of the forage-fed horses responding rapidly to abrupt dietary change.

TI  == intestinal colonization by a lachnospiraceae bacterium contributes to the development of diabetes in obese mice.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to identify bacteria that may contribute to the  onset of metabolic dysfunctions. we isolated and identified a candidate bacterium belonging to lachnospiraceae (strain aj110941) in the feces of hyperglycemic obese mice. the colonization of germ-free ob/ob mice by aj110941 induced significant increases in fasting blood glucose levels as well as liver and mesenteric adipose tissue weights, and decreases in plasma insulin levels and homa-beta values. these results indicated that the specific gut commensal bacterium aj110941 influenced the development of obesity and diabetes in ob/ob mice with genetic susceptibility for obesity.

TI  == the atg16l1-t300a allele impairs clearance of pathosymbionts in the inflamed ileal mucosa of crohn's disease patients.
AB  == objective: crohn's disease (cd) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic, microbial and environmental factors. atg16l1 is an important genetic factor involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial components from the gut. we investigated the effect of inflammation on the composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of cd patients in relation to the atg16l1 risk status. design: biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed regions of the terminal ileum of 11 cd patients homozygous for the atg16l1 risk allele (atg16l1-t300a) and 9 cd patients homozygous for the atg16l1  protective allele (atg16l1-t300). biopsy dna was extracted and the bacterial composition analysed by pyrosequencing. intracellular survival rates of adherent-invasive escherichia coli (aiec) were analysed by determining colony forming units after exposure to monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers homozygous for the atg16l1 risk or protective allele. results: inflamed ileal tissue from patients homozygous for the atg16l1 risk allele contained increased numbers of fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal tissue of patients homozygous for the atg16l1 protective allele showed decreased numbers of bacteroidaceae and  enterobacteriaceae and increased lachnospiraceae. the atg16l1 allele did not affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed ileal tissue. monocytes homozygous for the atg16l1 risk allele showed impaired killing of aiec under inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for the atg16l1 protective allele. conclusions: cd patients homozygous for the atg16l1-t300a risk allele show impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that atg16l1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon inflammation.

TI  == effect of oral administration of metronidazole or prednisolone on fecal microbiota in dogs.
AB  == gastrointestinal microbiota have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various gastrointestinal disorders in dogs, including acute diarrhea and chronic enteropathy. metronidazole and prednisolone are commonly prescribed for the treatment of these diseases; however, their effects on gastrointestinal microbiota have not been investigated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of these drugs on the gastrointestinal microbiota of dogs. metronidazole was administered twice daily at 12.5 mg/kg to a group of five healthy dogs, and prednisolone at 1.0 mg/kg daily to a second group of five healthy dogs for 14 days. fecal samples were collected before and after administration (day 0 and 14), and 14 and 28 days after cessation (day 28 and 42). dna was extracted, and the bacterial diversity and composition of each sample were determined based on 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences using next-generation sequencing (illumina miseq). in the group administered metronidazole, bacterial diversity indices significantly decreased at day 14, and recovered after the cessation. principal coordinates analysis and hierarchical dendrogram construction based on unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrices revealed that bacterial composition was also significantly altered by metronidazole at day 14 compared with the other time points. the proportions of bacteroidaceae, clostridiaceae, fusobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, turicibacteraceae, and veillonellaceae decreased, while bifidobacteriaceae, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcaceae, and streptococcaceae increased at day 14 and returned to their initial proportions by day 42. conversely, no effect of prednisolone was observed on either the bacterial diversity or composition. reducing pathogenic bacteria such as fusobacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium through the administration of metronidazole may be beneficial for promoting gastrointestinal health; however, further investigations into the effects on diseased dogs are needed.

TI  == susceptibility to campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural campylobacter infection in exposed  poultry abattoir workers. the gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16s amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of campylobacter infection in sweden. the gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for campylobacter and those who remained negative. individuals who became campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.007) and escherichia (p = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.017) and streptococcus (p = 0.034) sequences than the campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of clostridiales (p = 0.017), unclassified lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), and anaerovorax (p = 0.015) sequences. intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the campylobacter-positive group (p < 0.005). the results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to campylobacter colonization in humans and that campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. importance: studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. the relative abundances of escherichia coli and bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to gram-negative pathogens in general and campylobacter infection in particular. in this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for campylobacter. as their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of bacteroides spp. and e. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance  also in humans.

TI  == the bacterial microbiota of stolotermes ruficeps (stolotermitidae), a phylogenetically basal termite endemic to new zealand.
AB  == stolotermes ruficeps is a widespread, primitive, lower termite occupying dead and decaying wood of many tree species in new zealand's temperate forests. we identified core bacterial taxa involved in gut processes through combined dna- and rna (cdna)-based pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s nucleotide sequence from  five s. ruficeps colonies. most family and many genus-level taxa were common to s. ruficeps colonies despite being sampled from different tree species. major taxa identified were spirochaetaceae, elusimicrobiaceae and porphyromonadaceae. others less well known in termite guts were synergistaceae, desulfobacteraceae, rhodocyclaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. synergistaceae, lachnospiraceae and spirochaetaceae were well represented in the rna data set, indicating a high-protein synthesis potential. using 130,800 sequences from nine  s. ruficeps dna and rna data sets, we estimated a high level of bacterial richness (4024 phylotypes at 3% genetic distance). very few abundant phylotypes were site-specific; almost all (95%) abundant phylotypes, representing 97% of data set sequences, were detected in at least two s. ruficeps colonies. this study of a little-researched phylogenetically basal termite identifies core bacteria taxa. these findings will extend inventories of termite gut microbiota and contribute to the understanding of the specificity of termite gut microbiota.

TI  == phenolic metabolites and substantial microbiome changes in pig feces by ingesting grape seed proanthocyanidins.
AB  == proanthocyanidin (pac) consumption has been linked to better colonic health, but  pacs are poorly absorbed, making them a target for colonic metabolism. the resulting metabolites are low molecular weight and could potentially be absorbed. to understand the effects of dietary pacs it would be important to resolve the metabolic issue and link these changes to microbial population changes in a suitable model for human digestion. here, six crossbred female pigs were fed a diet containing 1% (w/w) of meganatural(r) gold grape seed extract (gse) daily for 6 days. fecal samples were analyzed by normal phase lc coupled to fluorescence detection and lc-ms/tof. dna was extracted from pig fecal samples and the v3/v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was sequenced using an illumina miseq.  intact parent pacs (dimer-pentamer) were observed in the feces on days 3 and 6 at similar high levels ( approximately 400 mg kg(-1) total) during ingestion of gse  but were absent 48 h post-feeding. the major phenolic metabolites were 4-hydroxyphenylvaleric acid and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid which increased by approximately 30 and 3 mg kg(-1) respectively. the gse diet also caused an ecological shift in the microbiome, dramatically increasing lachnospiraceae, clostridales, lactobacillus and ruminococcacceae. the relationship between dietary pacs and colon health may be attributable to the altered bacterial populations or phenolic compounds in the colon.

TI  == enteric dysbiosis promotes antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection: systemic dissemination of resistant and commensal bacteria through epithelial transcytosis.
AB  == antibiotic usage promotes intestinal colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. however, whether resistant bacteria gain dominance in enteric microflora or disseminate to extraintestinal viscera remains unclear. our aim was to investigate temporal diversity changes in microbiota and transepithelial routes of bacterial translocation after antibiotic-resistant enterobacterial colonization. mice drinking water with or without antibiotics were intragastrically gavaged with ampicillin-resistant (amp-r) nonpathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) and given normal water afterward. the composition and  spatial distribution of intestinal bacteria were evaluated using 16s rdna sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. bacterial endocytosis in epithelial cells was examined using gentamicin resistance assay and transmission  electromicroscopy. paracellular permeability was assessed by tight junctional immunostaining and measured by tissue conductance and luminal-to-serosal dextran  fluxes. our results showed that antibiotic treatment enabled intestinal colonization and transient dominance of orally acquired amp-r e. coli in mice. the colonized amp-r e. coli peaked on day 3 postinoculation and was competed out  after 1 wk, as evidenced by the recovery of commensals, such as escherichia, bacteroides, lachnospiraceae, clostridium, and lactobacillus. mucosal penetration and extraintestinal dissemination of exogenous and endogenous enterobacteria were correlated with abnormal epithelial transcytosis but uncoupled with paracellular  tight junctional damage. in conclusion, antibiotic-induced enteric dysbiosis predisposes to exogenous infection and causes systemic dissemination of both antibiotic-resistant and commensal enterobacteria through transcytotic routes across epithelial layers. these results may help explain the susceptibility to sepsis in antibiotic-resistant enteric bacterial infection.

TI  == diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the diversity of the butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (go) supplementation as revealed by  molecular analysis of cloned 16s rrna genes. six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with go ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). ruminal contents were used for dna extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. a total bacterial clone  library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16s rrna gene cloned sequences using universal primers. the resulting plasmids selected by butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and go group, respectively. in libraries, clones were classified to the genus pseudobutyrivibrio, butyrivibrio and others within the family lachnospiraceae. additionally, some specific clones were observed in go group, being classified to the genus ruminococcus and others within the family ruminococcaceae. based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. b. proteoclasticus and ps. ruminis) in control and go groups, respectively. further clones identified as b. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and r. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and go groups, respectively. the majority of clones resembled ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and go group 2.91). our results indicated that the  butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.

TI  == metabolomics analysis identifies intestinal microbiota-derived biomarkers of colonization resistance in clindamycin-treated mice.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota protect the host against enteric pathogens  through a defense mechanism termed colonization resistance. antibiotics excreted  into the intestinal tract may disrupt colonization resistance and alter normal metabolic functions of the microbiota. we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that alterations in levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal specimens could provide useful biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment. methods: to assess in vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with oral vancomycin-resistant enterococcus or clostridium difficile spores at varying time points after treatment with the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin. for concurrent groups of antibiotic-treated mice, stool samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in the microbiota and using non-targeted metabolic profiling. to assess whether the findings were applicable to another antibiotic class that suppresses intestinal anaerobes, similar experiments were conducted with piperacillin/tazobactam. results: colonization resistance began to recover within 5 days and was intact by 12 days after clindamycin treatment, coinciding with the recovery bacteria from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, both part of the phylum firmicutes. clindamycin treatment caused marked changes in metabolites present in fecal specimens. of 484 compounds analyzed, 146 (30%) exhibited a significant increase or decrease in concentration during clindamycin  treatment followed by recovery to baseline that coincided with restoration of in  vivo colonization resistance. identified as potential biomarkers of colonization  resistance, these compounds included intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that increased (pentitols, gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites) or decreased (pentoses, dipeptides) with clindamycin treatment. piperacillin/tazobactam treatment caused similar alterations in the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolites. conclusions: recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. these metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.

TI  == mode of delivery shapes gut colonization pattern and modulates regulatory immunity in mice.
AB  == delivery mode has been associated with long-term changes in gut microbiota composition and more recently also with changes in the immune system. this has further been suggested to link cesarean section (c-section) with an increased risk for development of immune-mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes. in this study, we demonstrate that both c-section and cross-fostering with a genetically  distinct strain influence the gut microbiota composition and immune key markers in mice. gut microbiota profiling by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and  454/flx-based 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that mice born by c-section had a distinct bacterial profile at weaning characterized by higher abundance of bacteroides and lachnospiraceae, and less rikenellaceae and ruminococcus. no clustering according to delivery method as determined by principal component analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles  was evident in adult mice. however, the adult c-section-born mice had lower proportions of foxp3(+) regulatory t cells, tolerogenic cd103(+) dendritic cells, and less il10 gene expression in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens. this demonstrates long-term systemic effect on the regulatory immune system that was also evident in nod mice, a model of type 1 diabetes, born by c-section. however, no effect of delivery mode was seen on diabetes incidence or insulitis development. in conclusion, the first exposure to microorganisms seems to be crucial for the early life gut microbiota and priming of regulatory immune system in mice, and mode of delivery strongly influences this.

TI  == commensal gram-positive bacteria initiates colitis by inducing monocyte/macrophage mobilization.
AB  == breakdown of the intestinal epithelial layer's barrier function results in the inflow of commensal flora and improper immune responses against the commensal flora, leading to inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) development. using a mouse dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis model, we show here that commensal gram-positive bacteria trigger the mobilization of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages into the colon. monocytes/macrophages are major producers of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), a representative cytokine that aggravates colitis. notably, pretreating mice with vancomycin, which eliminated gram-positive bacteria, particularly the lachnospiraceae family, significantly reduced the severity of the colitis by selectively blocking the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages, but not of other cells. importantly, vancomycin treatment  specifically downregulated the colonic epithelial cell (cec) expression of c-c chemokine receptor type-2 (ccr2) ligands, which are critical chemokines for monocyte/macrophage mobilization into the inflamed colon. collectively, these results provide previously undiscovered evidence that gram-positive commensal bacteria induce colitis by recruiting colitogenic monocytes and macrophages. our  findings may lead to new avenues of treatment for ibd.

TI  == dietary history contributes to enterotype-like clustering and functional metagenomic content in the intestinal microbiome of wild mice.
AB  == understanding the origins of gut microbial community structure is critical for the identification and interpretation of potential fitness-related traits for the host. the presence of community clusters characterized by differences in the abundance of signature taxa, referred to as enterotypes, is a debated concept first reported in humans and later extended to other mammalian hosts. in this study, we provide a thorough assessment of their existence in wild house mice using a panel of evaluation criteria. we identify support for two clusters that are compositionally similar to clusters identified in humans, chimpanzees, and laboratory mice, characterized by differences in bacteroides, robinsoniella, and  unclassified genera belonging to the family lachnospiraceae. to further evaluate  these clusters, we (i) monitored community changes associated with moving mice from the natural to a laboratory environment, (ii) performed functional metagenomic sequencing, and (iii) subjected wild-caught samples to stable isotope analysis to reconstruct dietary patterns. this process reveals differences in the proportions of genes involved in carbohydrate versus protein metabolism in the functional metagenome, as well as differences in plant- versus meat-derived food  sources between clusters. in conjunction with wild-caught mice quickly changing their enterotype classification upon transfer to a standard laboratory chow diet, these results provide strong evidence that dietary history contributes to the presence of enterotype-like clustering in wild mice.

AB  == background: the intestinal tract harbours a complex and diverse microbial population that is important for health, yet has been poorly described in many species. this study explored the fecal microbiota of semi-free-ranging wood bison (bison bison athabascae). results: a total of 2081936 16s rrna (v4) sequences from 40 bison were evaluated. catchall analysis of richness predicted a mean of 10685 species per sample (range 5428-24764, sd 4136). diversity was high, with an average inverse simpson's index of 31.78 (sd 15.3, range 8.55-86.7). twenty-one different phyla were identified; however, only firmicutes and proteobacteria, actinobacteria accounted for >1% of sequences. two distinct population clusters (group a, n = 19 and group b, n = 21) were evident based on both community membership and population structure. group a had a significantly lower relative abundance of actinobacteria (6.4 vs 11.8%, p = 0.002), chloroflexi (0.002 vs 0.013%, p = 0.014), gemmatimonadetes (0.007 vs 0.15%, p = 0.038) and proteobacteria (18.7 vs 42.5%, p = <0.0001) and a greater relative abundance of firmicutes (70.9 vs 39.3%, p < 0.0001) than group b. within group b, alphaproteobacteria was the most common class of proteobacteria (28% of all sequences), while caulobacteraceae (18.5%), pseudomonadaceae (3.5%), hyphomicrobiaceae (3.5%), alcaligenaceae (3.1%) and xanthomonadaceae (2.6%) were  the most abundant families. the twenty (3.1%) most abundant genera accounted for  71% of sequences. no operational taxon units (otus) were found in all samples at  a relative abundance of 1% or greater. one otu (clostridium cluster xi) was present at 1% or more in all group a samples, with two other clostridium cluster  xi otus in 18/19 (95%) samples. no otus were found at that abundance in all group b sample, but an unclassified lachnospiraceae was present in 20/21 (95%) and clostridium cluster xi and brevundimonas were found in 19 (90%) samples. conclusions: the fecal microbiota of wood bison is rich and diverse. the presence of two distinct populations not associated with housing, age or gender suggest that enterotypes, distinctly different microbial population compositions that can achieve the same ultimate function, might be present in bison, as has been suggested in humans.

TI  == microbiome data distinguish patients with clostridium difficile infection and non-c. difficile-associated diarrhea from healthy controls.
AB  == antibiotic usage is the most commonly cited risk factor for hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infections (cdi). the increased risk is due to disruption of the indigenous microbiome and a subsequent decrease in colonization resistance by the perturbed bacterial community; however, the specific changes in the microbiome that lead to increased risk are poorly understood. we developed statistical models that incorporated microbiome data with clinical and demographic data to better understand why individuals develop cdi. the 16s rrna genes were sequenced from the feces of 338 individuals, including cases, diarrheal controls, and nondiarrheal controls. we modeled cdi and diarrheal status using multiple clinical variables, including age, antibiotic use, antacid  use, and other known risk factors using logit regression. this base model was compared to models that incorporated microbiome data, using diversity metrics, community types, or specific bacterial populations, to identify characteristics of the microbiome associated with cdi susceptibility or resistance. the addition  of microbiome data significantly improved our ability to distinguish cdi status when comparing cases or diarrheal controls to nondiarrheal controls. however, only when we assigned samples to community types was it possible to differentiate cases from diarrheal controls. several bacterial species within the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, bacteroides, and porphyromonadaceae were largely absent in cases and highly associated with nondiarrheal controls. the improved discriminatory ability of our microbiome-based models confirms the theory that factors affecting the microbiome influence cdi. importance the gut microbiome, composed of the trillions of bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, is responsible for a number of critical functions within  the host. these include digestion, immune system stimulation, and colonization resistance. the microbiome's role in colonization resistance, which is the ability to prevent and limit pathogen colonization and growth, is key for protection against clostridium difficile infections. however, the bacteria that are important for colonization resistance have not yet been elucidated. using statistical modeling techniques and different representations of the microbiome,  we demonstrated that several community types and the loss of several bacterial populations, including bacteroides, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae, are associated with cdi. our results emphasize the importance of considering the microbiome in mediating colonization resistance and may also direct the design of future multispecies probiotic therapies.

TI  == towards molecular biomarkers for biogas production from lignocellulose-rich substrates.
AB  == biogas production from lignocellulose-rich agricultural residues is gaining increasingly importance in sustainable energy production. hydrolysis/acidogenesis (h/a) of lignocellulose as the initial rate-limiting step deserves particular optimization. a mixture of straw/hay was methanized applying two-phase digester systems with an initial h/a reactor and a one-stage system at different, meso- and thermophilic temperatures. h/a was intensified with increasing ph values and  increasing temperature. h/a fermenters, however, were prone to switch to methanogenic systems at these conditions. substrate turnover was accelerated in the bi-phasic process but did not reach the methanation efficiency of the single-stage digestion. there was no indication that two different cellulolytic inocula could establish in the given process. bacterial communities were analyzed applying conventional amplicon clone sequencing targeting the hypervariable 16s rrna gene region v6-v8 and by metagenome analyses applying direct dna pyrosequencing without a pcr step. corresponding results suggested that pcr did not introduce a bias but offered better phylogenetic resolution. certain clostridium iv and prevotella members were most abundant in the h/a system operated at 38 degrees c, certain clostridium iii and lachnospiraceae bacteria in the 45 degrees c, and certain clostridium iv and thermohydrogenium/thermoanaerobacterium members in the 55 degrees c h/a system. clostridium iii representatives, lachnospiraceae and thermotogae dominated in the thermophilic single-stage system, in which also a higher portion of known syntrophic acetate oxidizers was found. specific (rt-)qpcr systems were designed  and applied for the most significant and abundant populations to assess their activity in the different digestion systems. the rt-qpcr results agreed with the  dna based community profiles obtained at the different temperatures. up to 10(12) 16s rrna copies ml(-1) were determined in h/a fermenters with prevalence of rrna  of a ruminococcaceae subgroup. besides, thermohydrogenium/thermoanaerobacterium rrna prevailed at thermophilic and prevotellaceae rrna at mesophilic conditions.  the developed (rt)-qpcr systems can be used as biomarkers to optimize biogas production from straw/hay and possibly other lignocellulosic substrates.

TI  == long term effect of gut microbiota transfer on diabetes development.
AB  == the composition of the gut microbiome represents a very important environmental factor that influences the development of type 1 diabetes (t1d). we have previously shown that myd88-deficient non-obese diabetic (myd88-/-nod) mice, that were protected from t1d development, had a different composition of gut microbiota compared to wild type nod mice. the aim of our study was to investigate whether this protection could be transferred. we demonstrate that transfer of gut microbiota from diabetes-protected myd88-deficient nod mice, reduced insulitis and significantly delayed the onset of diabetes. gut bacteria from myd88-deficient mice, administered over a 3-week period, starting at 4 weeks of age, stably altered the family composition of the gut microbiome, with principally lachnospiraceae and clostridiaceae increased and lactobacillaceae decreased. the transferred mice had a higher concentration of iga and tgfbeta in  the lumen that was accompanied by an increase in cd8(+)cd103(+) and cd8alphabeta  t cells in the lamina propria of the large intestine. these data indicate not only that gut bacterial composition can be altered after the neonatal/weaning period, but that the composition of the microbiome affects the mucosal immune system and can delay the development of autoimmune diabetes. this result has important implications for the development of probiotic treatment for t1d.

TI  == impact of diet and individual variation on intestinal microbiota composition and  fermentation products in obese men.
AB  == there is growing interest in understanding how diet affects the intestinal microbiota, including its possible associations with systemic diseases such as metabolic syndrome. here we report a comprehensive and deep microbiota analysis of 14 obese males consuming fully controlled diets supplemented with resistant starch (rs) or non-starch polysaccharides (nsps) and a weight-loss (wl) diet. we  analyzed the composition, diversity and dynamics of the fecal microbiota on each  dietary regime by phylogenetic microarray and quantitative pcr (qpcr) analysis. in addition, we analyzed fecal short chain fatty acids (scfas) as a proxy of colonic fermentation, and indices of insulin sensitivity from blood samples. the  diet explained around 10% of the total variance in microbiota composition, which  was substantially less than the inter-individual variance. yet, each of the study diets induced clear and distinct changes in the microbiota. multiple ruminococcaceae phylotypes increased on the rs diet, whereas mostly lachnospiraceae phylotypes increased on the nsp diet. bifidobacteria decreased significantly on the wl diet. the rs diet decreased the diversity of the microbiota significantly. the total 16s ribosomal rna gene signal estimated by qpcr correlated positively with the three major scfas, while the amount of propionate specifically correlated with the bacteroidetes. the dietary responsiveness of the individual's microbiota varied substantially and associated inversely with its diversity, suggesting that individuals can be stratified into  responders and non-responders based on the features of their intestinal microbiota.

TI  == revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria have recently gained attention, since they are important for a healthy colon and when altered contribute to emerging diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and type ii diabetes. this guild is polyphyletic and cannot be accurately detected by 16s rrna gene sequencing. consequently, approaches targeting the terminal genes of the main butyrate-producing pathway have been developed. however, since additional pathways exist and alternative, newly recognized enzymes catalyzing the terminal reaction have been described, previous investigations are often incomplete. we undertook a broad analysis of butyrate-producing pathways and individual genes by screening 3,184 sequenced bacterial genomes from the integrated microbial genome database. genomes of 225 bacteria with a potential to produce butyrate were identified, including many previously unknown candidates. the majority of candidates belong to distinct families within the firmicutes, but members of nine other phyla, especially from  actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, spirochaetes, and thermotogae, were also identified as potential butyrate producers. the established gene catalogue (3,055 entries) was used to screen for butyrate synthesis pathways in 15 metagenomes derived from stool samples of healthy individuals provided by the hmp (human microbiome project) consortium. a high percentage of total genomes exhibited a butyrate-producing pathway (mean, 19.1%;  range, 3.2% to 39.4%), where the acetyl-coenzyme a (coa) pathway was the most prevalent (mean, 79.7% of all pathways), followed by the lysine pathway (mean, 11.2%). diversity analysis for the acetyl-coa pathway showed that the same few firmicute groups associated with several lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were dominating in most individuals, whereas the other pathways were associated primarily with bacteroidetes. importance microbiome research has revealed new, important roles of our gut microbiota for maintaining health, but an understanding of effects of specific microbial functions on the host is in its infancy, partly because in-depth functional microbial analyses are rare and publicly available databases are often incomplete/misannotated. in this study, we focused on production of butyrate, the main energy source for colonocytes, which  plays a critical role in health and disease. we have provided a complete database of genes from major known butyrate-producing pathways, using in-depth genomic analysis of publicly available genomes, filling an important gap to accurately assess the butyrate-producing potential of complex microbial communities from "-omics"-derived data. furthermore, a reference data set containing the abundance and diversity of butyrate synthesis pathways from the healthy gut microbiota was  established through a metagenomics-based assessment. this study will help in understanding the role of butyrate producers in health and disease and may assist the development of treatments for functional dysbiosis.

AB  == sub-saharan africa represents 69% of the total number of individuals living with  hiv infection worldwide and 72% of aids deaths globally. pulmonary infection is a common and frequently fatal complication, though little is known regarding the lower airway microbiome composition of this population. our objectives were to characterize the lower airway microbiome of ugandan hiv-infected patients with pneumonia, to determine relationships with demographic, clinical, immunological,  and microbiological variables and to compare the composition and predicted metagenome of these communities to a comparable cohort of patients in the us (san francisco). bronchoalveolar lavage samples from a cohort of 60 ugandan hiv-infected patients with acute pneumonia were collected. amplified 16s ribosomal rna was profiled and aforementioned relationships examined. ugandan airway microbiome composition and predicted metagenomic function were compared to us hiv-infected pneumonia patients. among the most common bacterial pulmonary pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa was most prevalent in the ugandan cohort. patients with a richer and more diverse airway microbiome exhibited lower bacterial burden, enrichment of members of the lachnospiraceae and sulfur-reducing bacteria and reduced expression of tnf-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-9. compared to san franciscan patients, ugandan airway microbiome was significantly richer, and compositionally distinct with predicted  metagenomes that encoded a multitude of distinct pathogenic pathways e.g secretion systems. ugandan pneumonia-associated airway microbiome is compositionally and functionally distinct from those detected in comparable patients in developed countries, a feature which may contribute to adverse outcomes in this population.

TI  == the metabolizable energy of dietary resistant maltodextrin is variable and alters fecal microbiota composition in adult men.
AB  == resistant maltodextrin (rm) is a novel soluble, nonviscous dietary fiber. its metabolizable energy (me) and net energy (ne) values derived from nutrient balance studies are unknown, as is the effect of rm on fecal microbiota. a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study was conducted (n = 14 men) to determine the me and ne of rm and its influence on fecal excretion of  macronutrients and microbiota. participants were assigned to a sequence consisting of 3 treatment periods [24 d each: 0 g/d rm + 50 g/d maltodextrin and  2 amounts of dietary rm (25 g/d rm + 25 g of maltodextrin/d and 50 g/d rm + 0 g/d maltodextrin)] and were provided all the foods they were to consume to maintain their body weight. after an adaptation period, excreta were collected during a 7-d period. after the collection period, 24-h energy expenditure was measured. fluorescence in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and 454 titanium technology-based 16s rrna sequencing were used to analyze fecal microbiota composition. fecal amounts of energy (544, 662, 737 kj/d), nitrogen (1.5, 1.8, 2.1 g/d), rm (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 g/d), and total carbohydrate (11.1, 14.2,  16.2 g/d) increased with increasing dose (0, 25, 50 g) of rm (p < 0.0001). fat excretion did not differ among treatments. the me value of rm was 8.2 and 10.4 kj/g, and the ne value of rm was -8.2 and 2.0 kj/g for the 25 and 50 g/d rm doses, respectively. both doses of rm increased fecal wet weight (118, 148, 161 g/d; p < 0.0001) and fecal dry weight (26.5, 32.0, 35.8 g/d; p < 0.0001) compared with the maltodextrin placebo. total counts of fecal bacteria increased by 12% for the 25 g/d rm dose (p = 0.17) and 18% for the 50 g/d rm dose (p = 0.019). rm  intake was associated with statistically significant increases (p < 0.001) in various operational taxonomic units matching closest to ruminococcus, eubacterium, lachnospiraceae, bacteroides, holdemania, and faecalibacterium, implicating rm in their growth in the gut. our findings provide empirical data important for food labeling regulations related to the energy value of rm and suggest that rm increases fecal bulk by enhancing the excretion of nitrogen and carbohydrate and the growth of specific microbial populations.

TI  == fermented dairy products modulate citrobacter rodentium-induced colonic hyperplasia.
AB  == we evaluated the protective effects of fermented dairy products (fdps) in an infection model, using the mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium (cr). treatment of mice with fdp formulas a, b, and c or a control product did not affect cr colonization, organ specificity, or attaching and effacing lesion formation. fermented dairy product a (fdp-a), but neither the supernatant from fdp-a nor beta-irradiated (ir) fdp-a, caused a significant reduction in colonic crypt hyperplasia and cr-associated pathology. profiling the gut microbiota revealed that ir-fdp-a promoted higher levels of phylotypes belonging to alcaligenaceae and a decrease in lachnospiraceae (ruminococcus) during cr infection. conversely, fdp-a prevented a decrease in ruminococcus and increased turicibacteraceae (turicibacter). importantly, loss of ruminococcus and turicibacter has been associated with susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. our results demonstrate that viable bacteria in fdp-a reduced cr-induced colonic crypt hyperplasia and prevented the loss of key bacterial genera that may contribute to disease pathology.

TI  == 454 pyrosequencing reveals changes in the faecal microbiota of adults consuming lactobacillus casei zhang.
AB  == probiotics are believed to help to maintain a healthy balance of the human gut microbiota. lactobacillus casei zhang (lcz) is a novel potential probiotic isolated from the naturally fermented food koumiss. to better understand the impact of this potential probiotic on human intestinal microbiota, 24 subjects were randomly recruited for a longitudinal study: the subjects were required to consume lcz for 28 days, and faecal samples were collected prior to, during and after the lcz consumption phase. alterations in the gut microbiota were monitored using 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction(q-pcr) technologies. we found that the consumption of lcz significantly altered the composition of intestinal microbiota (p < 0.001) and the gut microbiota diversity. further analysis at the genus level revealed a positive correlation between lcz and prevotella, lactobacillus, faecalibacterium, propionibacterium, bifidobacterium and an unidentified genus from bacteroidaceae and lachnospiraceae and a negative correlation between lcz administration and the presence of clostridium, phascolarctobacterium, serratia, enterococcus, shigella and shewanella. furthermore, these changes were confirmed by q-pcr data.

TI  == discordance between changes in the gut microbiota and pathogenicity in a mouse model of spontaneous colitis.
AB  == under conventional conditions, mice deficient in core 1-derived o-glycans (tm-iec c1galt1(-/-)), which have a defective mucus layer, experienced spontaneous inflammation of the colon. analysis of fecal bacterial populations by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene showed that disease in conventional tm-iec c1galt1(-/-) was associated with shifts in the microbiota manifested by increases in lactobacillus and clostridium species, and decreases in unclassified ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae. under germ-free (gf) conditions, tm-iec c1galt1(-/-) presented decreased goblet cells, but did not develop inflammation.  monoassociation of gf tm-iec c1galt1(-/-) revealed that bacterial species differ  significantly in their ability to induce inflammatory changes. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron caused inflammation, while lactobacillus johnsonii (enriched during colitis) did not. these observations demonstrate that not all microbiota shifts that correlate with disease contribute to pathogenesis.

AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == a phylogenomic view of ecological specialization in the lachnospiraceae, a family of digestive tract-associated bacteria.
AB  == several bacterial families are known to be highly abundant within the human microbiome, but their ecological roles and evolutionary histories have yet to be  investigated in depth. one such family, lachnospiraceae (phylum firmicutes, class clostridia) is abundant in the digestive tracts of many mammals and relatively rare elsewhere. members of this family have been linked to obesity and protection from colon cancer in humans, mainly due to the association of many species within the group with the production of butyric acid, a substance that is important for  both microbial and host epithelial cell growth. we examined the genomes of 30 lachnospiraceae isolates to better understand the origin of butyric acid capabilities and other ecological adaptations within this group. butyric acid production-related genes were detected in fewer than half of the examined genomes with the distribution of this function likely arising in part from lateral gene transfer (lgt). an investigation of environment-specific functional signatures indicated that human gut-associated lachnospiraceae possess genes for endospore formation, whereas other members of this family lack key sporulation-associated genes, an observation supported by analysis of metagenomes from the human gut, oral cavity, and bovine rumen. our analysis demonstrates that adaptation to an ecological niche and acquisition of defining functional roles within a microbiome can arise through a combination of both habitat-specific gene loss and lgt.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequencing of the ruminal bacteria from moose (alces alces) in vermont, alaska, and norway.
AB  == in the present study, the rumen bacteria of moose (alces alces) from three distinct geographic locations were investigated. moose are large, browsing ruminants in the deer family, which subsist on fibrous, woody browse, and aquatic plants. subspecies exist which are distinguished by differing body and antler size, and these are somewhat geographically isolated. seventeen rumen samples were collected from moose in vermont, alaska, and norway, and bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes were sequenced using roche 454 pyrosequencing with titanium chemistry. overall, 109,643 sequences were generated from the 17 individual samples, revealing 33,622 unique sequences. members of the phylum bacteroidetes were dominant in samples from alaska and norway, but representatives of the phylum firmicutes were dominant in samples from vermont. within the phylum bacteroidetes, prevotellaceae was the dominant family in all three sample locations, most of which belonged to the genus prevotella. within the phylum firmicutes, the family lachnospiraceae was the most prevalent in all three sample locations. the data set supporting the results of this article is available in the sequence read archive (sra), available through ncbi [study accession number srp022590]. samples clustered by geographic location and by weight and were heterogenous based on gender, location, and weight class (p < 0.05). location was a stronger factor in determining the core microbiome than either age or weight, but gender did not appear to be a strong factor. there were no shared operational taxonomic units across all 17 samples, which indicates that these moose may have  been isolated long enough to preclude a core microbiome among moose. other potential factors discussed include differences in climate, food quality and availability, gender, and life cycle.

TI  == phylogenetic distribution of three pathways for propionate production within the  human gut microbiota.
AB  == propionate is produced in the human large intestine by microbial fermentation and may help maintain human health. we have examined the distribution of three different pathways used by bacteria for propionate formation using genomic and metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiota and by designing degenerate primer sets for the detection of diagnostic genes for these pathways. degenerate  primers for the acrylate pathway (detecting the lcda gene, encoding lactoyl-coa dehydratase) together with metagenomic mining revealed that this pathway is restricted to only a few human colonic species within the lachnospiraceae and negativicutes. the operation of this pathway for lactate utilisation in coprococcus catus (lachnospiraceae) was confirmed using stable isotope labelling. the propanediol pathway that processes deoxy sugars such as fucose and rhamnose was more abundant within the lachnospiraceae (based on the pdup gene, which encodes propionaldehyde dehydrogenase), occurring in relatives of ruminococcus obeum and in roseburia inulinivorans. the dominant source of propionate from hexose sugars, however, was concluded to be the succinate pathway, as indicated by the widespread distribution of the mmda gene that encodes methylmalonyl-coa decarboxylase in the bacteroidetes and in many negativicutes. in general, the capacity to produce propionate or butyrate from hexose sugars resided in different species, although two species of lachnospiraceae (c. catus and r. inulinivorans) are now known to be able to switch from butyrate to propionate production on different substrates. a better understanding of the microbial ecology of short-chain fatty acid formation may allow modulation of propionate formation by the human gut microbiota.

TI  == two necrotic enteritis predisposing factors, dietary fishmeal and eimeria infection, induce large changes in the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == it is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following clostridium perfringens infection. however, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. we analysed caecal microbiota  of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16s rdna amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed  and eimeria infected chicks. we found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of c. perfringens infection. we noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable lactobacillus counts remained stable. the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, unknown clostridiales and lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (otus) that had previously been linked to crohn's disease and reductions in otus known to be butyrate producers. eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown clostridium species were increased in abundance. additionally, eimeria did not significantly influence changes in ph, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. both fishmeal feeding and eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.

AB  == the impact of human milk oligosaccharides (hmo) on mucosal immunity, gut microbiota and response to rotavirus (rv) infection was investigated in the piglet model. newborn piglets were fed with formula alone (ff) or formula supplemented with 4 g l(-1) hmo (hmo) or a prebiotic mixture of 9:1 short-chain galactooligosaccharides (3.6 g l(-1)) and long-chain fructooligosaccharides (0.4  g l(-1)) (pre) (n=19-21 per group) for 15 days. piglets (n=7-8) in each dietary group were orally infected with porcine rotavirus (rv) osu strain on d10, and stool consistency was assessed daily. blood, small intestine and colonic contents were collected at day 15. serum rv-specific antibody concentrations, intestinal histomorphology, rv non-structural protein-4 (nsp4) and cytokine mrna expression  were assessed. colonic content ph, dry matter (dm) and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were measured. ascending colonic microbiota was analyzed by 16s rrna gene v1-3 region pyrosequencing. hmo- and pre-fed groups had shorter duration of diarrhea than ff piglets. infection changed intestinal histomorphology, increased serum rv-specific antibody response and intestinal rv  nsp4 expression, and modulated ileal cytokine expression. hmo enhanced t helper type 1 (interferon-gamma) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines in the ileum, while prebiotics promoted rv-specific immunoglobulin m response to the infection. rv infection and hmo supplementation altered intraluminal environment  and gut microbiota. hmo increased ph and lowered dm of colonic contents and enhanced the abundance of unclassified lachnospiraceae, which contains numerous butyrate-producing bacteria. in conclusion, hmo and prebiotics did not prevent the onset of rv infection but reduced the duration of rv-induced diarrhea in piglets, in part, by modulating colonic microbiota and immune response to rv infection.

AB  == the upper respiratory tract (urt) is a distinct microbial niche of low-density bacterial communities and, also, a portal of entry for many potential pathogens,  including streptococcus pneumoniae. thus far, animal models have been used to study the dynamics of and interactions between limited numbers of different species in the urt. here, we applied a deep sequencing approach to explore, for the first time, the impact of s. pneumoniae acquisition on urt microbiota in a mouse model, as well as potential age-dependent effects. young-adult and elderly  mice were inoculated intranasally with s. pneumoniae, and nasal lavage samples were collected for up to 28 days postcolonization. bacterial dna extracted from lavage samples was subjected to barcoded pyrosequencing of the v5-to-v7 hypervariable region of the small-subunit rrna gene. we observed highly diverse microbial profiles, with the presence overall of 15 phyla and approximately 645 operational taxonomic units (otus). we noted differences in the composition of microbiota between young and elderly mice, with a significantly higher abundance  of bacteroidetes in the young mice. the introduction of s. pneumoniae into the urt led to a temporary dominance of pneumococci in the microbiota of all mice, accompanied by a significant decrease in microbial diversity. as mice gradually cleared the colonization, the diversity returned to baseline levels. diversification was accompanied by an early expansion of bacteroidetes, staphylococcus spp., and lachnospiraceae. moreover, the bacteroidetes expansion was significantly greater in young-adult than in elderly mice. in conclusion, we  observed differences in urt microbiota composition between naive young-adult and  elderly mice that were associated with differences in pneumococcal clearance over time.

AB  == balb/c mice were fed milk or lactobacillus casei bl23 in milk for 14d and fecal samples were collected at d 0, 4, and 7 as well as 1 and 8d after the last administration. according to high-throughput dna sequencing of the 16s rrna genes extracted from the fecal microbiota, the bacterial diversity in the fecal samples of all mice increased over time. after 14d of administration, the consumption of  milk and milk containing l. casei bl23 resulted in distinct effects on the microbial composition in the intestine. specifically, the proportions of bacteria in the lactobacillaceae, porphyromonadaceae, and comamonadaceae were significantly higher in mice fed the l. casei bl23-milk culture compared with one or more of the other groups of mice. the relative amounts of lachnospiraceae were higher and streptococcaceae were lower in mice fed milk alone. the changes were not found at d 4 and 7 during milk and l. casei feeding and were no longer detected 8d after administration was stopped. this study shows that consumption of milk or probiotic l. casei-containing milk results in non-overlapping, taxa-specific effects on the bacteria in the distal murine intestine.

TI  == characterisation of the faecal bacterial community in adult and elderly horses fed a high fibre, high oil or high starch diet using 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == faecal samples were collected from seventeen animals, each fed three different diets (high fibre, high fibre with a starch rich supplement and high fibre with an oil rich supplement). dna was extracted and the v1-v2 regions of 16srdna were  454-pyrosequenced to investigate the faecal microbiome of the horse. the effect of age was also considered by comparing mature (8 horses aged 5-12) versus elderly horses (9 horses aged 19-28). a reduction in diversity was found in the elderly horse group. significant differences between diets were found at an otu level (52 otus at corrected q<0.1). the majority of differences found were related to the firmucutes phylum (37) with some changes in bacteroidetes (6), proteobacteria (3), actinobacteria (2) and spirochaetes (1). for the forage only  diet,with no added starch or oil, we found 30/2934 otus (accounting for 15.9% of  sequences) present in all horses. however the core (i.e. present in all horses) associated with the oil rich supplemented diet was somewhat smaller (25/3029 otus, 10.3% ) and the core associated with the starch rich supplemented diet was  even smaller (15/2884 otus, 5.4% ). the core associated with samples across all three diets was extremely small (6/5689 otus accounting for only 2.3% of sequences) and dominated by the order clostridiales, with the most abundant family being lachnospiraceae. in conclusion, forage based diets plus starch or oil rich complementary feeds were associated with differences in the faecal bacterial community compared with the forage alone. further, as observed in people, ageing is associated with a reduction in bacterial diversity. however there was no change in the bacterial community structure in these healthy animals associated with age.

TI  == doenjang, a fermented korean soybean paste, inhibits lipopolysaccharide production of gut microbiota in mice.
AB  == doenjang has been reported to exhibit antioxidant, fibrinolytic, antimutagenic, anticancer, and antiobesity effects. in our preliminary study, doenjang decreased fecal lipopolysaccharide (lps) levels in mice. therefore, we investigated the effect of doenjang on the composition of gut microbiota in mice. treatment with doenjang significantly increased the number of bifidobacteria cultured in bl media, compared with mice not treated with doenjang. however, doenjang decreased  the number of enterobacteriaceae cultured in dhl media. doenjang significantly suppressed the beta-glucuronidase activity, but did not influence alpha-/beta-glucosaminidase and alpha-/beta-glucosidase activities. when gut microbiota in mice treated with or without doenjang was analyzed by pyrosequencing, doenjang induced a significant modulation of the populations of the dominant gut microbiota. at the phylum level, doenjang treatment resulted in  a significant decrease of firmicutes and an increase of bacteroidetes, which led  to a decrease in the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio in gut microbiota. at the  family level, the number of ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae were significantly decreased, while the number of odoribacter_f was increased in doenjang-treated mice. of colonic tight junction proteins, occludin, zo-1, and claudin-1 in mice, occludin alone was significantly increased by treatment with doenjang. although treatment with doenjang seemed to suppress nf-kappab activation, it was not significant. doenjang significantly suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression, whereas it did not influence interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6 expression. however, doenjang increased il-10 expression. based on these findings, doenjang may promote gut health by regulating gut microbiota and its lps concentrations and suppressing harmful enzyme production.

TI  == coprophagous behavior of rabbit pups affects implantation of cecal microbiota and health status.
AB  == during the first few weeks after delivery, female rabbits excrete fecal pellets,  which are ingested by their pups. we hypothesized that maternal excretion of hard fecal pellets and the coprophagous behavior of their pups were involved in cecal  microbiota implantation. four groups were compared: in 1 group (fm), pups had free access to maternal fecal pellets; in a second group, ingestion of feces was  prevented (nf); and in 2 additional groups, pups had access only to fecal pellets excreted by foreign females receiving either no antibiotic (ff) or tiamulin and tetracycline (ffab). a total of 109 litters in 3 batches were used to quantify excretion and ingestion of feces and mortality. bacterial composition was assessed by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 to v4 region of 16s rna genes and fermentative measurements in 128 rabbits of 1 batch at age 14, 35, 49, and 80 d with 8 rabbits per group for each age with 2 rabbits per litter. the number of fecal pellets excreted by does from 2 to 20 d after delivery ranged widely, but was similar among groups (16.1 +/- 12.6 fecal pellets/doe). the excretion peaked  during the first 6 d after delivery. foreign fecal ingestion (ff and ffab groups) was 3 times greater (p < 0.001) than ingestion of maternal feces (9.9 +/- 7.8). ingestion of feces in the ff group was greater than in the ffab groups (35.6 +/-  9.3 vs. 29.5 +/- 9.7; p < 0.05). compared with the fm group, ingestion of feces in the ff and ffab groups began later (6 to 7 d vs. 2 to 3 d after birth) and peaked at 14 to 17 d (4.0 +/- 1.8 hard fecal pellets.litter(-1) . d(-1)) and 13 to 15 d (3.5 +/- 1.7 hard fecal pellets litter(-1) d(-1)), respectively. during the 36 to 49 d period, the ff and nf groups exhibited the least (2.8%) and greatest (9.5%) mortality, respectively (p = 0.03). at age 14 d, the cecal bacterial community was dominated by bacteroidetes phyla (63.3 +/- 15.1%), bacteroidaceae family (36.0 +/- 18.8%), and bacteriodes genus (36.0 +/- 2.3%). with increasing age, firmicutes phyla, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae families became the dominant taxa (92.0 +/- 4.7, 44.0 +/- 13.7, 37.9 +/- 11.6% at age 80 d, respectively). impairment of fecal ingestion delayed this ecological succession, with greater and lower relative abundance of bacteroidaceae and ruminococcaceae, respectively, than in the other 3 groups at age 35 d (p < 0.10). in conclusion, although excretion of hard fecal pellets by does ranged widely, the coprophagous behavior of their pups affected the implantation of cecal bacterial microbiota.

TI  == investigation of bacterial diversity in the feces of cattle fed different diets.
AB  == the objective of this study is to investigate individual animal variation of bovine fecal microbiota including as affected by diets. fecal samples were collected from 426 cattle fed 1 of 3 diets typically fed to feedlot cattle: 1) 143 steers fed finishing diet (83% dry-rolled corn, 13% corn silage, and 4% supplement), 2) 147 steers fed late growing diet (66% dry-rolled corn, 26% corn silage, and 8% supplement), and 3) 136 heifers fed early growing diet (70% corn silage and 30% alfalfa haylage). bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were determined from individual fecal samples using next-generation pyrosequencing technology. a total of 2,149,008 16s rrna gene sequences from 333 cattle with at  least 2,000 sequences were analyzed. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were dominant phyla in all fecal samples. at the genus level, oscillibacter, turicibacter, roseburia, fecalibacterium, coprococcus, clostridium, prevotella, and succinivibrio were represented by more than 1% of total sequences. however, numerous sequences could not be assigned to a known genus. dominant unclassified  groups were unclassified ruminococcaceae and unclassified lachnospiraceae that could be classified to a family but not to a genus. these dominant genera and unclassified groups differed (p < 0.001) with diets. a total of 176,692 operational taxonomic units (otu) were identified in combination across all the 333 cattle. only 2,359 otu were shared across 3 diet groups. unifrac analysis showed that bacterial communities in cattle feces were greatly affected by dietary differences. this study indicates that the community structure of fecal microbiota in cattle is greatly affected by diet, particularly between forage- and concentrate-based diets.

TI  == ecotoxicology inside the gut: impact of heavy metals on the mouse microbiome.
AB  == background: the gut microbiota is critical for intestinal homeostasis. recent studies have revealed the links between different types of dysbiosis and diseases inside and outside the intestine. environmental exposure to pollutants (such as heavy metals) can also impair various physiological functions for good health. here, we studied the impact of up to 8 weeks of oral lead and cadmium ingestion on the composition of the murine intestinal microbiome. results: pyrosequencing of 16s rna sequences revealed minor but specific changes in bacterial commensal communities (at both family and genus levels) following oral exposure to the heavy metals, with notably low numbers of lachnospiraceae and high numbers levels of lactobacillaceae and erysipelotrichaceacae (mainly due to changes in turicibacter spp), relative to control animals. conclusions: non-absorbed heavy metals have a direct impact on the gut microbiota. in turn, this may impact the alimentary tract and overall gut homeostasis. our results may enable more accurate assessment of the risk of intestinal disease associated with heavy metal ingestion.

TI  == microbiota dynamics in patients treated with fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembraneous colitis and is responsible for a large and increasing fraction of hospital-acquired infections. fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is an alternate treatment option for recurrent c. difficile infection (rcdi) refractory to antibiotic therapy. it has recently been discussed favorably in the clinical and scientific communities and is receiving increasing public attention. however, short- and long-term health consequences of fmt remain a concern, as the effects  of the transplanted microbiota on the patient remain unknown. to shed light on microbial events associated with rcdi and treatment by fmt, we performed fecal microbiota analysis by 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing of 14 pairs of healthy donors and rcdi patients treated successfully by fmt. post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples collected up to one year after fmt were studied longitudinally, including one post-fmt patient with antibiotic-associated relapse three months after fmt. this analysis allowed us not only to confirm prior reports that rcdi is associated with reduced diversity and compositional changes  in the fecal microbiota, but also to characterize previously undocumented post-fmt microbiota dynamics. members of the streptococcaceae, enterococcaceae, or enterobacteriaceae were significantly increased and putative butyrate producers, such as lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were significantly reduced in samples from rcdi patients before fmt as compared to post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples. rcdi patient samples showed more case-specific variations  than post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples. however, none of the bacterial groups were invariably associated with rcdi or successful treatment by fmt. overall microbiota compositions in post-fmt patients, specifically abundances of  the above-mentioned firmicutes, continued to change for at least 16 weeks after fmt, suggesting that full microbiota recovery from rcdi may take much longer than expected based on the disappearance of diarrheal symptoms immediately after fmt.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus cgmcc1.3724 supplementation on weight loss and  maintenance in obese men and women.
AB  == the present study investigated the impact of a lactobacillus rhamnosus cgmcc1.3724 (lpr) supplementation on weight loss and maintenance in obese men and women over 24 weeks. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial, each subject consumed two capsules per d of either a placebo or a lpr formulation (1.6 x 10(8) colony-forming units of lpr/capsule with oligofructose and inulin).  each group was submitted to moderate energy restriction for the first 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of weight maintenance. body weight and composition were measured at baseline, at week 12 and at week 24. the intention-to-treat analysis  showed that after the first 12 weeks and after 24 weeks, mean weight loss was not significantly different between the lpr and placebo groups when all the subjects  were considered. however, a significant treatment x sex interaction was observed. the mean weight loss in women in the lpr group was significantly higher than that in women in the placebo group (p = 0.02) after the first 12 weeks, whereas it was similar in men in the two groups (p= 0.53). women in the lpr group continued to lose body weight and fat mass during the weight-maintenance period, whereas opposite changes were observed in the placebo group. changes in body weight and fat mass during the weight-maintenance period were similar in men in both the groups. lpr-induced weight loss in women was associated not only with significant reductions in fat mass and circulating leptin concentrations but also with the relative abundance of bacteria of the lachnospiraceae family in faeces. the present study shows that the lactobacillus rhamnosus cgmcc1.3724 formulation helps obese women to achieve sustainable weight loss.

TI  == comparing bacterial community composition between healthy and white plague-like disease states in orbicella annularis using phylochip g3 microarrays.
AB  == coral disease is a global problem. diseases are typically named or described based on macroscopic changes, but broad signs of coral distress such as tissue loss or discoloration are unlikely to be specific to a particular pathogen. for example, there appear to be multiple diseases that manifest the rapid tissue loss that characterizes 'white plague.' phylochip g3 microarrays were used to compare  the bacterial community composition of both healthy and white plague-like diseased corals. samples of lobed star coral (orbicella annularis, formerly of the genus montastraea[1]) were collected from two geographically distinct areas,  dry tortugas national park and virgin islands national park, to determine if there were biogeographic differences between the diseases. in fact, all diseased  samples clustered together, however there was no consistent link to aurantimonas  coralicida, which has been described as the causative agent of white plague type  ii. the microarrays revealed a large amount of bacterial heterogeneity within the healthy corals and less diversity in the diseased corals. gram-positive bacterial groups (actinobacteria, firmicutes) comprised a greater proportion of the operational taxonomic units (otus) unique to healthy samples. diseased samples were enriched in otus from the families corynebacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae, rhodobacteraceae, and streptococcaceae. much previous coral disease work has used clone libraries, which seem to be methodologically biased toward recovery of gram-negative bacterial sequences and may therefore have missed the importance of gram-positive groups. the phylochipdata presented here provide a broader characterization of the bacterial community changes that occur within orbicella annularis during the shift from a healthy to diseased state.

TI  == determination of bacteria constituting ruminal fibrolytic consortia developed on  orchard grass hay stem.
AB  == to determine the relationship between fibrobacter succinogenes and other rumen bacteria, the bacterial community structure on fiber was analyzed by using two different materials. these were ruminally incubated orchard grass hay stems without and with preincubation with f. succinogenes (natural and artificial consortia, respectively). the natural consortium mainly consisted of firmicutes (56.6%) and bacteroidetes (33.1%), while the artificial consortium showed a significantly higher proportion of firmicutes (85.5%) and a lower proportion of bacteroidetes (4.6%). at species or genus level, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, the u2 group, ruminococcus albus and lachnospiraceae incertae sedis made up a higher  proportion in the artificial consortium. the most dominant bacterial group was the butyrivibrio-pseudobutyrivibrio-lachnospiraceae incertae sedis group, which accounted for 19.7% in the natural and 29.5% in the artificial consortium. within the genus butyrivibrio, the phylogenetic groups sa and va2 and phylogeny-undefined butyribivrio, but not va1, were detected at high frequency in the artificial consortium. these results suggest that ecological and possibly functional relationships exist in the rumen among f. succinogenes, a subset of b. fibrisolvens, the u2 group, r. albus and lachnospiraceae incertae sedis.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota among sexual risk behavior groups of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (bv) remains elusive. bv may  be more common among women who have sex with women (wsw). the objective of this study was to use 454 pyrosequencing to investigate the vaginal microbiome of wsw, women who have sex with women and men (wswm), and women who have sex with men (wsm) with bv to determine if there are differences in organism composition between groups that may inform new hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of bv. methods: vaginal swab specimens from eligible women with bv at the mississippi state department of health std clinic were used. after dna extraction, 454 pyrosequencing of pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences was performed. sequence data was classified using the ribosomal database program classifer. complete linkage clustering analysis was performed to compare bacterial community composition among samples. differences in operational taxonomic units with an abundance of >/= 2% between risk behavior groups were determined. alpha and beta  diversity were measured using shannon's index implemented in qiime and unifrac analysis, respectively. results: 33 wsw, 35 wswm, and 44 wsm were included. the vaginal bacterial communities of all women clustered into four taxonomic groups with the dominant taxonomic group in each being lactobacillus, lachnospiraceae, prevotella, and sneathia. regarding differences in organism composition between risk behavior groups, the abundance of atopobium (relative ratio (rr)=0.24; 95%ci 0.11-0.54) and parvimonas (rr=0.33; 95%ci 0.11-0.93) were significantly lower in  wsw than wsm, the abundance of prevotella was significantly higher in wsw than wswm (rr=1.77; 95%ci 1.10-2.86), and the abundance of atopobium (rr=0.41; 95%ci 0.18-0.88) was significantly lower in wswm than wsm. overall, wsm had the highest diversity of bacterial taxa. conclusion: the microbiology of bv among women in different risk behavior groups is heterogeneous. wsm in this study had the highest diversity of bacterial taxa. additional studies are needed to better understand these differences.

TI  == newly cultured bacteria with broad diversity isolated from eight-week continuous  culture enrichments of cow feces on complex polysaccharides.
AB  == one of the functions of the mammalian large intestinal microbiota is the fermentation of plant cell wall components. in ruminant animals, the majority of  their nutrients are obtained via pregastric fermentation; however, up to 20% can  be recovered from microbial fermentation in the large intestine. eight-week continuous culture enrichments of cattle feces with cellulose and xylan-pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. a total of 459 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16s rrna gene sequencing. six phyla were represented: firmicutes (51.9%), bacteroidetes (30.9%), proteobacteria (11.1%), actinobacteria (3.5%), synergistetes (1.5%), and fusobacteria (1.1%). the majority of bacterial isolates had <98.5% identity to cultured bacteria with  sequences in the ribosomal database project and thus represent new species and/or genera. within the firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and clostridiaceae i. the  majority of the bacteroidetes were most closely related to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, and b. xylanisolvens and members of the porphyromonadaceae family. many of the firmicutes and bacteroidetes isolates were related to species demonstrated to possess enzymes which ferment plant cell wall  components; the others were hypothesized to cross-feed these bacteria. the microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. with over 98% of the isolates not represented as previously cultured,  there are new opportunities to study the genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.

TI  == identification of a core bacterial community within the large intestine of the horse.
AB  == the horse has a rich and complex microbial community within its gastrointestinal  tract that plays a central role in both health and disease. the horse receives much of its dietary energy through microbial hydrolysis and fermentation of fiber predominantly in the large intestine/hindgut. the presence of a possible core bacterial community in the equine large intestine was investigated in this study. samples were taken from the terminal ileum and 7 regions of the large intestine from ten animals, dna extracted and the v1-v2 regions of 16srdna 454-pyrosequenced. a specific group of otus clustered in all ileal samples and a  distinct and different signature existed for the proximal regions of the large intestine and the distal regions. a core group of bacterial families were identified in all gut regions with clear differences shown between the ileum and  the various large intestine regions. the core in the ileum accounted for 32% of all sequences and comprised of only seven otus of varying abundance; the core in  the large intestine was much smaller (5-15% of all sequences) with a much larger  number of otus present but in low abundance. the most abundant member of the core community in the ileum was lactobacillaceae, in the proximal large intestine the  lachnospiraceae and in the distal large intestine the prevotellaceae. in conclusion, the presence of a core bacterial community in the large intestine of  the horse that is made up of many low abundance otus may explain in part the susceptibility of horses to digestive upset.

TI  == association of dietary type with fecal microbiota in vegetarians and omnivores in slovenia.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to discover differences in the human fecal microbiota composition driven by long-term omnivore versus vegan/lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern. in addition, the possible association of demographic characteristics and dietary habits such as consumption of particular foods with the fecal microbiota was examined. methods: this study was conducted on a slovenian population comprising 31 vegetarian participants (11 lacto-vegetarians  and 20 vegans) and 29 omnivore participants. bacterial dna was extracted from the frozen fecal samples by maxwell 16 tissue dna purification kit (promega). relative quantification of selected bacterial groups was performed by real-time pcr. differences in fecal microbiota composition were evaluated by pcr-dgge fingerprinting of the v3 16s rrna region. participants' demographic characteristics, dietary habits and health status information were collected through a questionnaire. results: vegetarian diet was associated with higher ratio (% of group-specific dna in relation to all bacterial dna) of bacteroides-prevotella, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium clostridioforme and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but with lower ratio (%) of clostridium cluster xiva. real-time pcr also showed a higher concentration and ratio of enterobacteriaceae (16s rdna copies/g and %) in female participants (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and decrease in bifidobacterium with age (p < 0.01). dgge analysis of the 16s rrna v3 region showed that relative quantity of dgge bands from certain bacterial groups was lower (bifidobacterium, streptococus, collinsella and lachnospiraceae) or higher (subdoligranulum) among vegetarians, indicating the association of dietary type with bacterial community composition. sequencing of selected dgge bands revealed the presence of common representatives of fecal microbiota: bacteroides, eubacterium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcaceae, bifidobacterium and lachnospiraceae. up to 4 % of variance in microbial community analyzed by dgge could be explained by the vegetarian type of diet. conclusions:  long-term vegetarian diet contributed to quantity and associated bacterial community shifts in fecal microbiota composition. consumption of foods of animal  origin (eggs, red meat, white meat, milk, yoghurt, other dairy products, fish and seafood) and vegetarian type of diet explained the largest share of variance in microbial community structure. fecal microbiota composition was also associated with participants' age, gender and body mass.

TI  == fecal protease activity is associated with compositional alterations in the intestinal microbiota.
AB  == objective: intestinal proteases carry out a variety of functions in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. studies have reported that elevated enteric proteases in patients with gi disease can alter intestinal physiology, however the origin (human vs. microbial) of elevated proteases in patients with gi disease is unclear. aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the association between protease activity and the microbiota in human fecal samples. design: in order to capture a wide range of fecal protease (fp) activity stool samples were  collected from 30 ibs patients and 24 healthy controls. the intestinal microbiota was characterized using 454 high throughput pyro-sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the composition and diversity of microbial communities were determined and compared using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (qiime) pipeline. fp activity levels were determined using an elisa-based method. fp activity was ranked and top and bottom quartiles (n=13 per quartile) were identified as having high and low fp activity, respectively. results: the overall diversity of the intestinal microbiota displayed significant clustering separation (p = 0.001) between samples with high vs. low fp activity. the lactobacillales, lachnospiraceae, and streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with fp activity across the entire study population, whilst the ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fp activity. conclusions: these data demonstrate significant associations between specific intestinal bacterial groups and fecal protease activity and provide a basis for further causative studies investigating the role of enteric microbes and gi diseases.

AB  == this study aimed at investigating the fecal microbiota and metabolome of children with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pdd-nos) and autism (ad) in comparison to healthy children (hc). bacterial tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) of the 16s rdna and 16s rrna analyses were carried out to determine total bacteria (16s rdna) and metabolically active bacteria (16s rrna), respectively. the main bacterial phyla  (firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria and verrucomicrobia) significantly (p<0.05) changed among the three groups of children. as estimated by rarefaction, chao and shannon diversity index, the highest microbial diversity was found in ad children. based on 16s-rrna and culture-dependent data, faecalibacterium and ruminococcus were present at the highest level in fecal samples of pdd-nos and hc children. caloramator, sarcina and clostridium genera were the highest in ad children. compared to hc, the composition of lachnospiraceae family also differed in pdd-nos and, especially, ad children. except for eubacterium siraeum, the lowest level of eubacteriaceae was found on fecal samples of ad children. the level of bacteroidetes genera and some alistipes and akkermansia species were almost the highest in pdd-nos or ad children as well as almost all the identified sutterellaceae and enterobacteriaceae were the highest in ad. compared to hc children, bifidobacterium species decreased in ad. as shown by canonical discriminant analysis of principal coordinates, the levels of free amino acids and volatile organic compounds of fecal samples were markedly affected in pdd-nos and, especially, ad children. if the gut microbiota differences among ad and pdd-nos and hc children are one of the concomitant causes or the consequence of autism, they may have implications regarding specific diagnostic test, and/or for treatment and prevention.

TI  == overfeeding and genetics affect the composition of intestinal microbiota in anas  platyrhynchos (pekin) and cairina moschata (muscovy) ducks.
AB  == to investigate the effect of overfeeding on the ileal and cecal microbiota of two genotypes of ducks (pekin and muscovy), high-throughput 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing was used. the ducks were overfed for 12 days with 58% maize flour  and 42% maize grain. samples were collected before the overfeeding period (at 12  weeks), at 13 weeks, at 14 weeks, and 3 h after feeding. in parallel, ducks fed ad libitum were killed at the same ages. whatever the digestive segment, the genotype, and the level of intake, firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the dominant  phyla in the bacterial community of ducks (at least 80%). before overfeeding, ileal samples were dominated by bacilli, clostridia, and bacteroidia classes (>/= 70%), and cecal samples, by bacteroidia and clostridia classes (around 90%) in both pekin and muscovy ducks. the richness and diversity decreased in the ileum and increased in the ceca after overfeeding. overfeeding triggers major changes in the ileum, whereas the ceca are less affected. overfeeding increased the relative abundance of clostridiaceae, lactobacillaceae, streptococcaceae, and enterococcaceae families in the ileum, whereas genotype affects particularly three families: lachnospiraceae, bacteroidaceae, and desulfovibrionaceae in the ceca.

AB  == objectives: fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) from healthy donors, which is  an effective alternative for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated disease, is being considered for several disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome. disease remission upon fmt is thought to be facilitated by an efficient colonization of healthy donor microbiota, but knowledge of the composition and temporal stability of patient microbiota after fmt is lacking. methods: five patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (mayo score >/=6) and refractory to standard therapy received fmt via nasojejunal tube and enema. in addition to clinical activity and adverse events, the patients' fecal bacterial communities were monitored at multiple time points for up to 12 weeks using 16s rrna gene-targeted pyrosequencing. results: fmt elicited fever and a temporary increase of c-reactive protein. abundant bacteria from donors established in recipients, but  the efficiency and stability of donor microbiota colonization varied greatly. a positive clinical response was observed after 12 weeks in one patient whose microbiota had been effectively augmented by fmt. this augmentation was marked by successive colonization of donor-derived phylotypes including the anti-inflammatory and/or short-chain fatty acid-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, rosebura faecis, and bacteroides ovatus. disease severity (as measured by the mayo score) was associated with an overrepresentation of enterobacteriaceae and an underrepresentation of lachnospiraceae. conclusions: this study highlights the value of characterizing temporally resolved microbiota  dynamics for a better understanding of fmt efficacy and provides potentially useful diagnostic indicators for monitoring fmt success in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == high-fat diet alters gut microbiota physiology in mice.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota is known to regulate host energy homeostasis and can be influenced by high-calorie diets. however, changes affecting the ecosystem at the functional level are still not well characterized. we measured shifts in cecal bacterial communities in mice fed a carbohydrate or high-fat (hf) diet for 12 weeks at the level of the following: (i) diversity and taxa distribution by high-throughput 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing; (ii) bulk and single-cell chemical composition by fourier-transform infrared- (ft-ir) and raman micro-spectroscopy and (iii) metaproteome and metabolome via high-resolution mass spectrometry. high-fat diet caused shifts in the diversity of dominant gut bacteria and altered the proportion of ruminococcaceae (decrease) and rikenellaceae (increase). ft-ir spectroscopy revealed that the impact of the diet on cecal chemical fingerprints is greater than the impact of microbiota composition. diet-driven changes in biochemical fingerprints of members of the bacteroidales and lachnospiraceae were also observed at the level of single cells, indicating that there were distinct differences in cellular composition of dominant phylotypes under different diets. metaproteome and metabolome analyses based on the occurrence of 1760 bacterial proteins and 86 annotated metabolites revealed distinct hf diet-specific profiles. alteration of hormonal and anti-microbial networks, bile acid and bilirubin metabolism and shifts towards amino acid and simple sugars metabolism were observed. we conclude that a hf diet markedly affects the gut bacterial ecosystem at the functional level.

TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == vitamin d regulates the gut microbiome and protects mice from dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis.
AB  == the active form of vitamin d [1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25(oh)2d3] and the vitamin d receptor (vdr) regulate susceptibility to experimental colitis. the effect of the bacterial microflora on the susceptibility of c57bl/6 mice to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was determined. mice that cannot produce 1,25(oh)2d3 [cyp27b1 (cyp) knockout (ko)], vdr ko as well as their wild-type littermates were used. cyp ko and vdr ko mice had more bacteria from the bacteroidetes and proteobacteria phyla and fewer bacteria from the firmicutes and deferribacteres phyla in the feces compared with wild-type. in particular, there  were more beneficial bacteria, including the lactobacillaceae and lachnospiraceae families, in feces from cyp ko and vdr ko mice than in feces from wild-type. helicobacteraceae family member numbers were elevated in cyp ko compared with wild-type mice. depletion of the gut bacterial flora using antibiotics protected  mice from colitis. 1,25(oh)2d3 treatment (1.25 mug/100 g diet) of cyp ko mice decreased colitis severity and reduced the numbers of helicobacteraceae in the feces compared with the numbers in the feces of untreated cyp ko mice. the mechanisms by which the dysbiosis occurs in vdr ko and cyp ko mice included lower expression of e-cadherin on gut epithelial and immune cells and fewer tolerogenic dendritic cells that resulted in more gut inflammation in vdr and cyp ko mice compared with wild-type mice. increased host inflammation has been shown to provide pathogens with substrates to out-compete more beneficial bacterial species. our data demonstrate that vitamin d regulates the gut microbiome and that 1,25(oh)2d3 or vdr deficiency results in dysbiosis, leading to greater susceptibility to injury in the gut.

TI  == infection with the carcinogenic liver fluke opisthorchis viverrini modifies intestinal and biliary microbiome.
AB  == opisthorchis viverrini is a fish-borne trematode endemic in east asia. following  ingestion, the flukes locate to the biliary tre where chronic infection frequently leads to cholangiocarcinoma (cca). the mechanisms by which o. viverrini infection culminates in cca remain unknown. an unexplored aspect is its influence on the host microbiome. in the hamster, infection with this pathogen reliably leads to cca. genomic dnas of microbiota from colorectal contents and bile of hamsters and from whole o. viverrini were examined in this model of fluke-induced cca. microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of variable regions 7-9 of prokaryotic 16s ribosomal dna. of approximately 1 million sequences, 536,009 with useable reads were assignable to  29,776 operational taxonomy units (otus) and, in turn, to 20 phyla and 273 genera of bacteria or archaea. microbial community analyses revealed that fluke infection perturbed the gastrointestinal tract microbiome, increasing lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and lactobacillaceae, while decreasing porphyromonadaceae, erysipelotrichaceae, and eubacteriaceae (p</=0.05). more than 60 otus were detected in the biliary system, which confirmed bacteriobilia and a  noteworthy community of microbes associated with the parasites. the fluke-associated microorganisms included potential pathogens from the enterobacteriaceae and listeriaceae and others, including cyanobacteria and deinococci, usually found in external environments. given that opisthorchiasis is distinguished from other helminth infections by a robust inflammatory phenotype with conspicuously elevated il-6, and that inflammation of the biliary system leads to periductal fibrosis, which is a precursor of cca, the flukes and their microbiota may together drive this distinctive immune response.

TI  == the microbial community in the feces of the white rhinoceros (ceratotherium simum) as determined by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis.
AB  == as a non-ruminant herbivore, the white rhinoceros has the ability to utilize fibrous plant matter through microbial fermentation in the hindgut. so far, there has been no report using molecular techniques to study the gut microbiota of the  white rhinoceros. we used barcoded pyrosequencing to characterize 105,651 sequences of 16s rrna genes obtained from fecal samples from five white rhinoceroses. results showed that firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla in the samples, which were comprised largely of unclassified bacteria. the microbiota of one animal treated with drug therapy differed from those in other healthy animals, and was dominated by aerococcus -related bacteria. the core microbiota in the healthy rhinoceros were dominated by phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, represented by the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, rikenellaceae and prevotellaceae families. the present work provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the complex microbial community of the rhinoceros; however, further studies are required to link the distinctive microbiota with their digestive role in the hindgut of the white rhinoceros.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == influence of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection on the composition of chicken cecal microbiota.
AB  == background: infection of newly hatched chicks with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis) results in an inflammatory response in the intestinal tract which may influence the composition of gut microbiota. in this study we were therefore interested whether s. enteritidis induced inflammation results in changes in the cecal microbiota. to reach this aim, we compared the cecal microbiota of non-infected chickens and those infected by s. enteritidis by pyrosequencing the v3/v4 variable regions of genes coding for 16s rrna. results:  cecal microbiota of chickens up to 19 days of life was dominated by representatives of enterobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, followed by lactobacillaceae. the presence of lachnospiraceae did not change after s. enteritidis infection. enterobacteriaceae increased and ruminococcaceae  decreased after s. enteritidis infection in two independent experiments although  these results were not significant. a significant increase in both experiments was observed only for the representatives of lactobacillaceae which may correlate with their microaerophilic growth characteristic compared to the obligate anaerobes from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. conclusions: we  conclude that s. enteritidis infection influences the composition of the cecal microbiota in chickens but these changes are minor in nature and should be understood more as an indirect consequence of infection and inflammation rather than a positively selected evolutionary trait.

TI  == cirrhosis, bile acids and gut microbiota: unraveling a complex relationship.
AB  == a picture is now starting to emerge regarding the liver-bile acid-microbiome axis. increasing levels of the primary bile acid cholic acid (ca) causes a dramatic shift toward the firmicutes, particularly clostridium cluster xiva and increasing production of the harmful secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (dca).  during progression of cirrhosis, the microbiome, both through their metabolism, cell wall components (lps) and translocation lead to inflammation. inflammation suppresses synthesis of bile acids in the liver leading to a positive-feedback mechanism. decrease in bile acids entering the intestines appears to favor overgrowth of pathogenic and pro-inflammatory members of the microbiome including porphyromonadaceae and enterobacteriaceae. decreasing bile acid concentration in  the colon in cirrhosis is also associated with decreases in clostridium cluster xiva, which includes bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria which produce dca. rifaximin treatment appears to act by suppressing dca production, reducing endotoxemia and harmful metabolites without significantly altering microbiome structure. taken together, the bile acid pool size and composition appear to be a major regulator of microbiome structure, which in turn appears to be an important regulator of bile acid pool size and composition. the balance between this equilibrium is critical for human health and disease.

TI  == modulation of post-antibiotic bacterial community reassembly and host response by candida albicans.
AB  == the introduction of candida albicans into cefoperazone-treated mice results in changes in bacterial community reassembly. our objective was to use high-throughput sequencing to characterize at much greater depth the specific changes in the bacterial microbiome. the colonization of c. albicans significantly altered bacterial community reassembly that was evident at multiple taxonomic levels of resolution. there were marked changes in the levels of bacteriodetes and lactobacillaceae. lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, the two  most abundant bacterial families, did not change in relative proportions after antibiotics, but there were marked genera-level shifts within these two bacterial families. the microbiome shifts occurred in the absence of overt intestinal inflammation. overall, these experiments demonstrate that the introduction of a single new microbe in numerically inferior numbers into the bacterial microbiome  during a broad community disturbance has the potential to significantly alter the subsequent reassembly of the bacterial community as it recovers from that disturbance.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and depletion of butyrogenic bacteria in clostridium difficile infection and nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nearly half a million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the united states each year. although the importance of the gut microbiota in c. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. culture-independent high-density roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the  distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with cdi, 36 subjects with c. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (cdn), and 40 healthy control subjects. a  total of 526,071 partial 16s rrna sequence reads of the v1 to v3 regions were aligned with 16s databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the cdi and cdn groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the firmicutes phylum. normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing c2 to c4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in  the cdi and cdn groups. these data demonstrate associations between the depletion of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including c. difficile infection. mechanistic studies focusing on the functional roles of these organisms in diarrheal diseases and resistance against c. difficile colonization are warranted.

AB  == the rebirth of bacterial culture has been highlighted successively by environmental microbiologists, the design of axenic culture for intracellular bacteria in clinical microbiology, and, more recently, by human gut microbiota studies. indeed, microbial culturomics (large scale of culture conditions with the identification of colonies by maldi-tof or 16s rrna) allowed to culture 32 new bacterial species from only four stool samples studied. we performed culturomics in comparison with pyrosequencing 16s rrna targeting the v6 region on an anorexia nervosa stool sample because this clinical condition has never been explored before by culture, while its composition has been observed to be atypical by metagenomics. we tested 88 culture conditions generating 12,700 different colonies identifying 133 bacterial species, with 19 bacterial species never isolated from the human gut before, including 11 new bacterial species for  which the genome has been sequenced. these 11 new bacterial species isolated from a single stool sample allow to extend more significantly the repertoire in comparison to the bacterial species validated by the rest of the world during the last 2 years. pyrosequencing indicated a dramatic discrepancy with the culturomics results, with only 23 otus assigned to the species level overlapping  (17 % of the culturomics results). most of the sequences assigned to bacteria detected only by pyrosequencing belonged to ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and erysipelotrichaceae constituted by strictly anaerobic species, indicating the future route for culturomics. this study revealed new bacterial species participating significantly to the extension of the gut microbiota repertoire, which is the first step before being able to connect the bacterial composition with the geographic or clinical status.

AB  == twenty macropods from five locations in queensland, australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. specifically, the v3/v4 region of 16s rrna gene was examined. a total of 5040 otus were identified in the data set (post filtering). thirty-two otus were identified as 'shared' otus (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either firmicutes or bacteroidetes (clostridiales/bacteroidales). these phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. genera represented within the shared otus included: unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified lachnospiraceae, unclassified clostridiales, peptococcus sp. coprococcus spp., streptococcus spp., blautia sp., ruminoccocus sp., eubacterium sp., dorea sp., oscillospira sp. and butyrivibrio sp. the composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (macropus rufus, macropus giganteus and macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. specifically, eleven dominant otus that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified  ruminococcaceae, unclassified bacteroidales, prevotella spp. and a syntrophococcus sucromutans. putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in  cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry.

AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

TI  == a microbial signature approach to identify fecal pollution in the waters off an urbanized coast of lake michigan.
AB  == urban coasts receive watershed drainage from ecosystems that include highly developed lands with sewer and stormwater infrastructure. in these complex ecosystems, coastal waters are often contaminated with fecal pollution, where multiple delivery mechanisms that often contain multiple fecal sources make it difficult to mitigate the pollution. here, we exploit bacterial community sequencing of the v6 and v6v4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene to identify bacterial distributions that signal the presence of sewer, fecal, and human fecal pollution. the sequences classified to three sewer infrastructure-associated bacterial genera, acinetobacter, arcobacter, and trichococcus, and five fecal-associated bacterial families, bacteroidaceae, porphyromonadaceae, clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae, served  as signatures of sewer and fecal contamination, respectively. the human fecal signature was determined with the bayesian source estimation program sourcetracker, which we applied to a set of 40 sewage influent samples collected  in milwaukee, wi, usa to identify operational taxonomic units (>/= 97 % identity) that were most likely of human fecal origin. during periods of dry weather, the magnitudes of all three signatures were relatively low in milwaukee's urban rivers and harbor and nearly zero in lake michigan. however, the relative contribution of the sewer and fecal signature frequently increased to > 2 % of the measured surface water communities following sewer overflows. also during combined sewer overflows, the ratio of the human fecal pollution signature to the fecal pollution signature in surface waters was generally close to that of sewage, but this ratio decreased dramatically during dry weather and rain events, suggesting that nonhuman fecal pollution was the dominant source during these weather-driven scenarios. the qpcr detection of two human fecal indicators, human bacteroides and lachno2, confirmed the urban fecal footprint in this ecosystem extends to at least 8 km offshore.

AB  == the ruminal microbiome of cattle plays an important role not only in animal health and productivity but also in food safety and environment. microbial profiles of rumen fluid obtained from dairy cows fed on three different fiber/starch diet compositions were characterized. tagged 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and statistical analysis revealed that the dominant ruminal bacteria shared by all three sample groups belonged to phyla bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. however, the relative abundance of these bacterial groups was markedly affected by diet composition. in animals fed with a high fiber diet, the fibrolytic and cellulolytic bacteria lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and fibrobacteraceae were found in highest abundance compared with animals fed other diets with lower fiber content. the polysaccharide-degrading prevotellaceae and flavobacteriaceae bacteria were most  abundant in the rumen of cows fed on diet with the highest starch content. these  data highlight the ruminal microbiome's ability to adapt to feed composition and  also provide a basis for the development of feed formulation systems designed to  improve livestock productivity.

AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

TI  == fecal microbiome and volatile organic compound metabolome in obese humans with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
AB  == background & aims: the histopathology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is similar to that of alcoholic liver disease. colonic bacteria are a source of many metabolic products, including ethanol and other volatile organic compounds (voc) that may have toxic effects on the human host after intestinal absorption and delivery to the liver via the portal vein. recent data suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota in obese human beings is different from that of healthy-weight individuals. the aim of this study was to compare the colonic microbiome and voc metabolome of obese nafld patients (n = 30) with healthy controls (n = 30). methods: multitag pyrosequencing was used to characterize the  fecal microbiota. fecal voc profiles were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. results: there were statistically significant differences in liver  biochemistry and metabolic parameters in nafld. deep sequencing of the fecal microbiome revealed over-representation of lactobacillus species and selected members of phylum firmicutes (lachnospiraceae; genera, dorea, robinsoniella, and  roseburia) in nafld patients, which was statistically significant. one member of  phylum firmicutes was under-represented significantly in the fecal microbiome of  nafld patients (ruminococcaceae; genus, oscillibacter). fecal voc profiles of the 2 patient groups were different, with a significant increase in fecal ester compounds observed in nafld patients. conclusions: a significant increase in fecal ester voc is associated with compositional shifts in the microbiome of obese nafld patients. these novel bacterial metabolomic and metagenomic factors are implicated in the etiology and complications of obesity.

TI  == sewage reflects the distribution of human faecal lachnospiraceae.
AB  == faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional  enterococci and escherichia coli faecal indicators. we used massively parallel sequencing (mps) of the 16s rrna gene to characterize microbial communities from  wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the usa. we examined members of the clostridiales, which included the families clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. clone libraries targeting clostridium coccoides (c. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that lachnospiraceae-annotated v6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported c. coccoides group. we used oligotyping to profile the genus  blautia within lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. these findings suggest that  indicators based on blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

TI  == the impact of environmental heterogeneity and life stage on the hindgut microbiota of holotrichia parallela larvae (coleoptera: scarabaeidae).
AB  == gut microbiota has diverse ecological and evolutionary effects on its hosts. however, the ways in which it responds to environmental heterogeneity and host physiology remain poorly understood. to this end, we surveyed intestinal microbiota of holotrichia parallela larvae at different instars and from different geographic regions. bacterial 16s rrna gene clone libraries were constructed and clones were subsequently screened by dgge and sequenced. firmicutes and proteobacteria were the major phyla, and bacteria belonging to ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, enterobacteriaceae, desulfovibrionaceae and rhodocyclaceae families were commonly found in all natural populations. however,  bacterial diversity (chao1 and shannon indices) and community structure varied across host populations, and the observed variation can be explained by soil ph,  organic carbon and total nitrogen, and the climate factors (e.g., mean annual temperature) of the locations where the populations were sampled. furthermore, increases in the species richness and diversity of gut microbiota were observed during larval growth. bacteroidetes comprised the dominant group in the first instar; however, firmicutes composed the majority of the hindgut microbiota during the second and third instars. our results suggest that the gut's bacterial community changes in response to environmental heterogeneity and host's physiology, possibly to meet the host's ecological needs or physiological demands.

AB  == background: 16s rrna-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now  known to have an infectious etiology. here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (iai) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons). results: using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (af) and cord blood (cb) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (ptb), iai, and/or eons. ptb cases were grouped as 1) group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive eons (n=6). 2)  group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with positive iai (n=16).  3) group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with no iai (n=7); 4) group 4- no eons or iai (n=7). in addition, samples from term healthy deliveries  (n=8) served as technical controls. a total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in af, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in cb, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant)  identified, of which only 2 (escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. of those, bergeyella, fusobacterium nucleatum, and sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in eons before. the novel species identified in af by pcr include peptoniphilus harei and lachnospiraceae sp. the majority (72%) of cb species were also detected in the matching af, with e. coli and f. nucleatum as the most prevalent. the 16s rrna sequences of paired af and cb were  99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. conclusions: previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in eons. microbial species in paired af and cb likely share the same infectious origin. given its prevalence in eons, f. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as e. coli.

TI  == broad diversity and newly cultured bacterial isolates from enrichment of pig feces on complex polysaccharides.
AB  == one of the fascinating functions of mammalian intestinal microbiota is fermentation of plant cell wall components. eight-week continuous culture enrichments of pig feces with cellulose and xylan/pectin were used to isolate bacteria from this community. a total of 575 bacterial isolates were classified phylogenetically using 16s rrna gene sequencing. six phyla were represented in the bacterial isolates: firmicutes (242), bacteroidetes (185), proteobacteria (65), fusobacteria (55), actinobacteria (23), and synergistetes (5). the majority of the bacterial isolates had >/= 97 % similarity to cultured bacteria with sequences in the rdp, but 179 isolates represent new species and/or genera. within the firmicutes isolates, most were classified in the families of lachnospiraceae, enterococcaceae, staphylococcaceae, and clostridiaceae i. the majority of the bacteroidetes were most closely related to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, and b. xylanisolvens. many of the firmicutes and bacteroidetes isolates were identified as species that possess enzymes that ferment plant cell wall components, and the rest likely support these bacteria. the microbial communities that arose in these enrichment cultures had broad bacterial diversity. with over 30 % of the isolates not represented in  culture, there are new opportunities to study genomic and metabolic capacities of these members of the complex intestinal microbiota.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.
AB  == fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is becoming a more widely used technology  for treatment of recurrent clostridum difficile infection (cdi). while previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for fmt, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat cdi. here we report that high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following fmt using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. post fmt samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. proteobacteria and actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to fmt. post fmt samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of  members of the families bacteroidaceae, rikenellaceae and porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of bacteroides, alistipes and parabacteroides genera. members of the phylum firmicutes were represented by ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified clostridiales and members of the firmicutes. one patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal proteobacteria, primarily enterobacteriaceae. our results demonstrate that frozen fecal microbiota from a healthy donor can be used to effectively treat recurrent cdi resulting in restoration of the structure of gut microbiota and clearing of clostridum difficile.

TI  == the restoration of the vaginal microbiota after treatment for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or probiotics.
AB  == whether or not treatment with antibiotics or probiotics for bacterial vaginosis (bv) is associated with a change in the diversity of vaginal microbiota in women  was investigated. one hundred fifteen women, consisting of 30 healthy subjects, 30 bv-positive control subjects, 30 subjects with bv treated with a 7-day metronidazole regimen, and 25 subjects with bv treated with a 10-day probiotics regimen, were analyzed to determine the efficacy and disparity of diversity and richness of vaginal microbiota using 454 pyrosequencing. follow-up visits at days 5 and 30 showed a greater bv cure rate in the probiotics-treated subjects (88.0 and 96 %, respectively) compared to the metronidazole-treated subjects (83.3 and  70 %, respectively [p = 0.625 at day 5 and p = 0.013 at day 30]). treatment with  metronidazole reduced the taxa diversity and eradicated most of the bv-associated phylotypes, while probiotics only suppressed the overgrowth and re-established vaginal homeostasis gradually and steadily. despite significant interindividual variation, the microbiota of the actively treated groups or participants constituted a unique profile. along with the decrease in pathogenic bacteria, such as gardnerella, atopobium, prevotella, megasphaera, coriobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae, mycoplasma, and sneathia, a lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota was recovered. acting as vaginal sentinels and biomarkers, the relative abundance of lactobacillus and pathogenic bacteria determined the consistency of the bv clinical and microbiologic cure rates, as well as recurrent bv. both 7-day intravaginal metronidazole and 10-day intravaginal probiotics have good efficacy against bv, while probiotics maintained normal vaginal microbiota longer due to effective and steady vaginal microbiota restoration, which provide  new insights into bv treatment.

TI  == temporal variations of the ileal microbiota in intestinal ischemia and reperfusion.
AB  == gastrointestinal bacteria and epithelia contribute to systemic inflammation and infections in critically ill patients, but the gut microbiota in these diseases has not been analyzed dynamically by molecular fingerprinting methods. this study aimed to identify ileal flora dysbiosis pattern and bacterial species that changed significantly in a rat model of intestinal ischemia and reperfusion and illustrate time courses of both epithelial alterations and gut flora variations in the same injury. forty-eight rats were randomized into eight groups (n = 6/group). six groups underwent superior mesenteric artery occlusion for 30 min and were killed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h following reperfusion, respectively; a group of rats were killed just after anesthesia (control), and a sham-operated  group received 12-h reperfusion. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of ileal microbiota showed that gut flora pattern changed early after intestinal ischemia  and reperfusion, differed significantly at 12 h of reperfusion, and then started  to recover toward normal pattern. the specific dysbiosis were characterized by escherichia coli proliferation and lachnospiraceae and lactobacilli reduction. these bacteria that contributed most were identified by principal component analysis and sequencing and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. in  addition, alterations of ileal microbiota followed epithelial changes in the time course of reperfusion.

TI  == the diversity of the fecal bacterial community and its relationship with the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the feces during subacute rumen acidosis in dairy cows.
AB  == background: sub-acute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a well-recognized digestive disorder found in particular in well-managed dairy herds. sara can result in increased flow of fermentable substrates to the hindgut, which can increase the production of volatile fatty acids, alter the structure of the microbial community, and have a negative effect on animal health and productivity. however, little is known about changes in the structure of the microbial community and its relationship with fatty acids during sara. four cannulated primiparous (60 to 90  day in milk) holstein dairy cows were assigned to two diets in a 2 x 2 crossover  experimental design. the diets contained (on a dry matter basis): 40% (control diet, cod) and 70% (sara induction diet, said) concentrate feeds. samples of ruminal fluid and feces were collected on day 12, 15, 17 and 21 of the treatment  period, and the ph was measured in the ruminal and fecal samples; the fecal microbiota was determined by pyrosequencing analysis of the v1-v3 region of amplified 16s ribosomal rna (16s rrna). results: said decreased ruminal and fecal ph and increased the propionate, butyrate and total volatile fatty acid (tvfa) concentration in feces when compared with the cod. a barcoded dna pyrosequencing  method was used to generate 2116 16s operational taxonomic units (otus). a total  of 11 phyla were observed, distributed amongst all cattle on both diets; however, only 5 phyla were observed in all animals regardless of dietary treatment, and considerable animal to animal variation was revealed. the average abundance and its range of the 5 phyla were as follows: firmicutes (63.7%, 29.1-84.1%), proteobacteria (18.3%, 3.4-46.9%), actinobacteria (6.8%, 0.4-39.9%), bacteroidetes (7.6%, 2.2-17.7%) and tenericutes (1.6%, 0.3-3%). feeding the said  resulted in significant shifts in the structure of the fecal microbial community  when compared with the traditional cod. among the 2116 otus detected in the present study, 88 otus were affected significantly by diet; and the proportion of these otus was 20.6% and 17.4% among the total number of sequences, respectively. among the otus affected, the predominant species, including otu2140 (g: turicibacter), otu1695 (g: stenotrophomonas) and otu8143 (f: lachnospiraceae), were increased, while the abundance of otu1266 (s: solibacillus silvestris) and otu2022 (g: lysinibacillus) was reduced in the said group compared with the cod.  further, our results indicated that the fecal volatile fatty acid (vfa) concentrations were significantly related to presence of some certain species of  bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the feces. conclusions: this is, to our knowledge, the first study that has used barcoded dna pyrosequencing to survey the fecal microbiome of dairy cattle during sara. our results suggest that particular bacteria and their metabolites in the feces appear to contribute to differences in host health between those given said and traditional cod feeding.  a better understanding of these microbial populations will allow for improved nutrient management and increased animal growth performance.

TI  == the nonfermentable dietary fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose modulates intestinal microbiota.
AB  == diet influences host metabolism and intestinal microbiota; however, detailed understanding of this tripartite interaction is limited. to determine whether the nonfermentable fiber hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) could alter the intestinal microbiota and whether such changes correlated with metabolic improvements, c57b/l6 mice were normalized to a high-fat diet (hfd), then either  maintained on hfd (control), or switched to hfd supplemented with 10% hpmc, or a  low-fat diet (lfd). compared to control treatment, both lfd and hpmc reduced weight gain (11.8 and 5.7 g, respectively), plasma cholesterol (23.1 and 19.6%),  and liver triglycerides (73.1 and 44.6%), and, as revealed by 454-pyrosequencing  of the microbial 16s rrna gene, decreased microbial alpha-diversity and differentially altered intestinal microbiota. both lfd and hpmc increased intestinal erysipelotrichaceae (7.3- and 12.4-fold) and decreased lachnospiraceae (2.0- and 2.7-fold), while only hpmc increased peptostreptococcaceae (3.4-fold) and decreased ruminococcaceae (2.7-fold). specific microorganisms were directly linked with weight change and metabolic parameters in hpmc and hfd mice, but not  in lfd mice, indicating that the intestinal microbiota may play differing roles during the two dietary modulations. this work indicates that hpmc is a potential  prebiotic fiber that influences intestinal microbiota and improves host metabolism.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial communities in the guts of honey bees apis cerana and apis mellifera in korea.
AB  == the bacterial communities in the guts of the adults and larvae of the asian honey bee apis cerana and the european honey bee apis mellifera were surveyed by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna genes. most of the gut bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were highly similar to the known honey bee-specific ones and affiliated with pasteurellaceae or lactic acid bacteria (lab). the numbers of operational taxonomic units (otus, defined at 97% similarity) were lower in the larval guts (6 or 9) than in the adult guts (18 or 20), and the frequencies of pasteurellaceae-related otus were higher in the larval guts while those of lab-related otus in the adult guts. the frequencies of lactococcus, bartonella, spiroplasma, enterobacteriaceae, and flavobacteriaceae-related otus were much higher in a. cerana guts while bifidobacterium and lachnospiraceae-related otus were more abundant in a. mellfera guts. the bacterial community structures in the midguts and hindguts of the adult honey bees were not different for a. cerana, but significantly different for a. mellifera. the above results substantiated the previous observation that honey bee guts are dominated by several specific bacterial groups, and also showed that the relative abundances of otus could be markedly changed depending on the developmental stage, the location within the gut, and the honey bee species. the possibility of using the gut bacterial community as an indicator of honey bee health was discussed.

TI  == insight into the bacterial gut microbiome of the north american moose (alces alces).
AB  == background: the work presented here provides the first intensive insight into the bacterial populations in the digestive tract of the north american moose (alces alces). eight free-range moose on natural pasture were sampled, producing eight rumen samples and six colon samples. second generation (g2) phylochips were used  to determine the presence of hundreds of operational taxonomic units (otus), representing multiple closely related species/strains (>97% identity), found in the rumen and colon of the moose. results: a total of 789 unique otus were used for analysis, which passed the fluorescence and the positive fraction thresholds. there were 73 otus, representing 21 bacterial families, which were found exclusively in the rumen samples: lachnospiraceae, prevotellaceae and several unclassified families, whereas there were 71 otus, representing 22 bacterial families, which were found exclusively in the colon samples: clostridiaceae, enterobacteriaceae and several unclassified families. overall, there were 164 otus that were found in 100% of the samples. the firmicutes were the most dominant bacteria phylum in both the rumen and the colon. microarray data available at arrayexpress, accession number e-mexp-3721. conclusions: using phylotrac and unifrac computer software, samples clustered into two distinct groups: rumen and colon, confirming that the rumen and colon are distinct environments. there was an apparent correlation of age to cluster, which will be  validated by a larger sample size in future studies, but there were no detectable trends based upon gender.

TI  == microbial ecology of the rumen evaluated by 454 gs flx pyrosequencing is affected by starch and oil supplementation of diets.
AB  == to provide a comprehensive examination of the bacterial diversity in the rumen content of cows fed different diets, high-throughput 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing was used. four rumen fistulated nonlactating holstein cows received 12 kg of dry matter per day of four diets based on maize silage during four periods: the low-starch diet (22% starch, 3% fat); the high-starch diet, supplemented with wheat plus barley (35% starch, 3% fat); the low-starch plus oil diet, supplemented with 5% of sunflower oil (20% starch, 7.6% fat) and the high-starch plus oil diet (33% starch, 7.3% fat). samples were taken after 12 days of adaptation, 5 h postfeeding. whatever the diet, bacterial community of sieved rumen contents was dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, prevotellaceae, and rikenellaceae families were highly present and were clearly affected by cow diet. the highest abundance of prevotellaceae and the lowest abundance of ruminococcaceae and rikenellaceae were found with the high-starch plus oil diet. dietary starch increased the relative abundance of only three genera: barnesiella, oribacterium and olsenella, but decreased the relative abundances of several genera, with very significant effects for rikenellaceae_rc9 and butyrivibrio-pseudobutyrivibrio. oil alone had  a limited effect, but interestingly, starch plus oil addition differently affected the bacterial populations compared to starch addition without oil.

TI  == the gut microbiome of kittens is affected by dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio and associated with blood metabolite and hormone concentrations.
AB  == high-protein, low-carbohydrate (hplc) diets are common in cats, but their effect  on the gut microbiome has been ignored. the present study was conducted to test the effects of dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio on the gut microbiota of growing kittens. male domestic shorthair kittens were raised by mothers fed moderate-protein, moderate-carbohydrate (mpmc; n 7) or hplc (n 7) diets, and then weaned at 8 weeks onto the same diet. fresh faeces were collected at 8, 12 and 16 weeks; dna was extracted, followed by amplification of the v4-v6 region of the 16s rrna gene using 454 pyrosequencing. a total of 384 588 sequences (average of  9374 per sample) were generated. dual hierarchical clustering indicated distinct  clustering based on the protein:carbohydrate ratio regardless of age. the protein:carbohydrate ratio affected faecal bacteria. faecal actinobacteria were greater (p< 0.05) and fusobacteria were lower (p< 0.05) in mpmc-fed kittens. faecal clostridium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcus, blautia and eubacterium were  greater (p< 0.05) in hplc-fed kittens, while dialister, acidaminococcus, bifidobacterium, megasphaera and mitsuokella were greater (p< 0.05) in mpmc-fed kittens. principal component analysis of faecal bacteria and blood metabolites and hormones resulted in distinct clusters. of particular interest was the clustering of blood tag with faecal clostridiaceae, eubacteriaceae, ruminococcaceae, fusobacteriaceae and lachnospiraceae; blood ghrelin with faecal  coriobacteriaceae, bifidobacteriaceae and veillonellaceae; and blood glucose, cholesterol and leptin with faecal lactobacillaceae. the present results demonstrate that the protein:carbohydrate ratio affects the faecal microbiome, and highlight the associations between faecal microbes and circulating hormones and metabolites that may be important in terms of satiety and host metabolism.

TI  == suppression of clostridium difficile in the gastrointestinal tracts of germfree mice inoculated with a murine isolate from the family lachnospiraceae.
AB  == the indigenous microbial community of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract determines  susceptibility to clostridium difficile colonization and disease. previous studies have demonstrated that antibiotic-treated mice challenged with c. difficile either developed rapidly lethal c. difficile infection or were stably colonized with mild disease. the gi microbial community of animals with mild disease was dominated by members of the bacterial family lachnospiraceae, while the gut community in moribund animals had a predominance of escherichia coli. we  investigated the roles of murine lachnospiraceae and e. coli strains in colonization resistance against c. difficile in germfree mice. murine lachnospiraceae and e. coli isolates were cultured from wild-type mice. the ability of each of these isolates to interfere with c. difficile colonization was tested by precolonizing germfree mice with these bacteria 4 days prior to experimental c. difficile challenge. mice precolonized with a murine lachnospiraceae isolate, but not those colonized with e. coli, had significantly  decreased c. difficile colonization, lower intestinal cytotoxin levels and exhibited less severe clinical signs and colonic histopathology. infection of germfree mice or mice precolonized with e. coli with c. difficile strain vpi 10463 was uniformly fatal by 48 h, but only 20% mortality was seen at 2 days in mice precolonized with the lachnospiraceae isolate prior to challenge with vpi 10463. these findings confirm that a single component of the gi microbiota, a murine lachnospiraceae isolate, could partially restore colonization resistance against c. difficile. further study of the members within the lachnospiraceae family could lead to a better understanding of mechanisms of colonization resistance against c. difficile and novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of c. difficile infection.

AB  == a strictly anaerobic gram-stain-variable but positive by structure, non-spore-forming bacterium designated lachnospiraceae bacterium acc2 strain dsm  24645(t) was isolated from human subgingival dental plaque. bacterial cells were  4-40 microm long non-motile rods, often swollen and forming curved filaments up to 200 microm. cells contained intracellular, poorly crystalline, nanometre-sized iron- and sulfur-rich particles. the micro-organism was able to grow on yeast extract, trypticase peptone, milk, some sugars and organic acids. the major metabolic end-products of glucose fermentation were butyrate, lactate, isovalerate and acetate. the growth temperature and ph ranges were 30-42 degrees  c and 4.9-7.5, respectively. major fatty acids were c14 : 0, c14 : 0 dma (dimethyl aldehyde), c16 : 0, c16 : 1omega7c dma. the whole-cell hydrolysate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, indicating peptidoglycan type a1gamma. the dna g+c content was calculated to be 55.05 mol% from the whole-genome sequence and 55.3 mol% as determined by hplc. there were no predicted genes responsible for biosynthesis of respiratory lipoquinones, mycolic acids and lipopolysaccharides. genes associated with synthesis of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, diaminopimelic acid, polar lipids and polyamines were present. according to the 16s rrna gene sequence phylogeny, strain dsm 24645(t) formed, together with several uncultured oral clones, a separate branch within the family lachnospiraceae, with the highest sequence similarity to the type strain of moryella indoligenes at 94.2 %. based on distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, we suggest that strain dsm 24645(t) represents a novel species in a new genus, for which the name stomatobaculum longum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of stomatobaculum longum is dsm 24645(t) ( = hm-480(t); deposited in bei resources, an nih collection managed by the atcc).

TI  == evaluation of different storage methods to characterize the fecal bacterial communities of captive western lowland gorillas (gorilla gorilla gorilla).
AB  == freezing is considered to be the best method for long-term storage of bacterial dna from feces; however this method cannot be usually applied for samples of wild primates collected in the challenging conditions of the tropical forest. in order to find an alternative conservation method of fecal samples from wild great apes, we compared freezing with other fixation methods. fecal samples from 11 captive gorillas (gorilla gorilla gorilla) from three czech zoos were stored using freezing, rna stabilization reagent (rnalater), and 96% ethanol. subsequently, the samples were examined using culture-independent methods (pcr-dgge, and real-time pcr) to qualitatively and quantitatively assess fecal microbiota composition and to compare differences among the storage methods. noticeably, freezing samples resulted in the highest recoveries of dna. no significant differences in dna recovery were found between freezing and using rnalater; however, significantly lower dna concentrations were recovered from samples stored in 96% ethanol. using pcr-dgge we found that either 96% ethanol, rnalater  or freezing were suitable for preserving bacterial dna; however fingerprints obtained from rnalater storage were more similar to those obtained from the frozen method; in comparison to the patterns resulting from storing samples in ethanol. using qpcr, frozen samples yielded the highest values of bacterial counts, with the exception of enterobacteriaceae, which showed the highest numbers using samples stored in ethanol. sequences of amplicons obtained from pcr-dgge belonged to the families clostridiaceae, lactobacillaceae, staphylococcaceae, and lachnospiraceae, phylum firmicutes; however most amplicons showed sequence similarity to previously uncultured microorganisms. bacteria belonging to the phylum firmicutes were the most frequently identified species in the fecal bacterial communities of captive western gorillas. the study showed that rnalater is an optimal storage method when freezing is not possible.

TI  == an eight-year investigation of bovine livestock fecal microbiota.
AB  == cattle represent a major source of fecal contamination worldwide. understanding the natural variation of the bovine livestock fecal microbiota is therefore important. for this reason we addressed the yearly differences of the fecal microbiota for bovine livestock reared in the same geographical region from 1999  to 2007 - analyzing a total of 300 samples representing a range of experimental regimes. the aim of our work was to determine the effect of year visa experimental regime of the bovine livestock fecal microbiota. we used a newly developed high-throughput 16s rrna sequencing approach (a single mixed sanger sequence was generated per sample) in combination with deep pyrosequencing. we found that similar feeding and treatment regimes for different years showed major differences in the fecal microbiota, suggesting other factors important for shaping the fecal microbiota than those experimentally controlled. ruminococcaeae, peptostreptococcaceae, acinetobacter, escherichia/shigella, lachnospiraceae and lactobacillales were the main taxa associated with the yearly fluctuations. furthermore, we found that fecal samples with high levels of lactobacillales, ruminococcaea and lachnospiraceae had the most even species distributions. the peptostreptococcaceae and acinetobacter dominated samples, on  the other hand, showed a few highly dominant taxa. testing of neutrality showed that the evenly distributed samples were explained by a neutral mode (that the assembly of the microbiota was random), while for the other samples there were overrepresentation of the dominant species (indicating bacterial-bacterial nice competition). we therefore propose that there are natural yearly fluctuations of  the bovine livestock microbiota - both with respect to ecology and composition. this knowledge will have impact on our management of fecal bacteria in the environment, since it is very difficult to predict risk based on historical data.

TI  == effect of high contents of dietary animal-derived protein or carbohydrates on canine faecal microbiota.
AB  == background: considerable evidence suggests that food impacts both the gastro-intestinal (gi) function and the microbial ecology of the canine gi tract. the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of high-carbohydrate (hc), high-protein (hp) and dry commercial (dc) diets on the canine colonic microbiota  in beagle dogs. diets were allocated according to the graeco-latin square design. for this purpose, microbial dna was isolated from faecal samples and separated by density gradient centrifugation, resulting in specific profiling based on the guanine-cytosine content (%g+c). in addition, 16 s rrna gene amplicons were obtained from the most abundant %g + c peaks and analysed by sequence analysis, producing a total of 720 non-redundant sequences (240 sequences per diet). results: the dc diet sample showed high abundance of representatives of the orders clostridiales, lactobacillales, coriobacteriales and bacteroidales. sequence diversity was highest for dc diet samples and included representatives of the orders lactobacillales and bacteroidales, which were not detected in samples from the hp and hc diets. these latter two diets also had reduced levels  of representatives of the family lachnospiraceae, specifically clostridial cluster xiva. the hc diet favoured representatives of the order erysipelotrichales, more specifically the clostridial cluster xviii, while the hp diet favoured representatives of the order fusobacteriales. conclusions: this study detected coriobacteriales in dog faeces, possibly due to the non-selective  nature of the %g + c profiling method used in combination with sequencing. moreover, our work demonstrates that the effect of diet on faecal microbiota can  be explained based on the metabolic properties of the detected microbial taxa.

AB  == background: to understand the relationship between our bacterial microbiome and health, it is essential to define the microbiome in the absence of disease. the digestive tract includes diverse habitats and hosts the human body's greatest bacterial density. we describe the bacterial community composition of ten digestive tract sites from more than 200 normal adults enrolled in the human microbiome project, and metagenomically determined metabolic potentials of four representative sites. results: the microbiota of these diverse habitats formed four groups based on similar community compositions: buccal mucosa, keratinized gingiva, hard palate; saliva, tongue, tonsils, throat; sub- and supra-gingival plaques; and stool. phyla initially identified from environmental samples were detected throughout this population, primarily tm7, sr1, and synergistetes. genera with pathogenic members were well-represented among this disease-free cohort. tooth-associated communities were distinct, but not entirely dissimilar,  from other oral surfaces. the porphyromonadaceae, veillonellaceae and lachnospiraceae families were common to all sites, but the distributions of their genera varied significantly. most metabolic processes were distributed widely throughout the digestive tract microbiota, with variations in metagenomic abundance between body habitats. these included shifts in sugar transporter types between the supragingival plaque, other oral surfaces, and stool; hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide production were also differentially distributed. conclusions: the microbiomes of ten digestive tract sites separated into four types based on composition. a core set of metabolic pathways was present across these diverse digestive tract habitats. these data provide a critical baseline for future studies investigating local and systemic diseases affecting human health.

TI  == acetatifactor muris gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the intestine of an obese mouse.
AB  == we used selective agar media for culturing bacteria from the caecum of mice fed a high calorie diet. in addition to the isolation of enterobacteriaceae growing on  a medium containing cholesterol and bile salts, we focused on the characterization of strain ct-m2(t), which, based on 16s rdna analysis, did not appear to correspond to any currently described organisms. the isolate belongs to the clostridium cluster xiv and is most closely related to members of the lachnospiraceae, including the genera anaerostipes, blautia, butyrivibrio, clostridium, coprococcus, eubacterium, robinsoniella, roseburia, ruminococcus and syntrophococcus (</=90 % similarity). strain ct-m2(t) is a non-motile gram-positive rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 48.5 %. cells grow under strictly anoxic conditions (100 % n(2)) and produce acetate and butyrate after growth in reduced wca broth. in contrast to related species, the new bacterium does not metabolize glucose and is positive for phenylalanine arylamidase, and its major cellular fatty acid is c(1)(4):(0). based on phylogenetic and phenotypic studies, the isolate merits recognition as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the name acetatifactor muris is proposed. the type strain is ct-m2(t) (= dsm 23669(t) = atcc baa-2170(t)).

TI  == phylotype-level 16s rrna analysis reveals new bacterial indicators of health state in acute murine colitis.
AB  == human inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis models in mice are associated with shifts in intestinal microbiota composition, but it is unclear at what taxonomic/phylogenetic level such microbiota dynamics can be indicative for  health or disease. here, we report that dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis is accompanied by major shifts in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota of stat1(-/-) and wild-type mice, as determined by 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s rrna (gene) amplicons, metatranscriptomics and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of selected phylotypes. the bacterial families ruminococcaceae, bacteroidaceae, enterobacteriaceae, deferribacteraceae and verrucomicrobiaceae increased in relative abundance in dss-treated mice. comparative 16s rrna sequence analysis at maximum possible phylogenetic resolution identified several indicator phylotypes for dss treatment, including the putative mucin degraders akkermansia and mucispirillum.  the analysis additionally revealed strongly contrasting abundance changes among phylotypes of the same family, particularly within the lachnospiraceae. these extensive phylotype-level dynamics were hidden when reads were grouped at higher  taxonomic levels. metatranscriptomic analysis provided insights into functional shifts in the murine intestinal microbiota, with increased transcription of genes associated with regulation and cell signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and respiration and decreased transcription of flagellin genes during inflammation. these findings (i) establish the first in-depth inventory of the mouse gut microbiota and its metatranscriptome in the dss colitis model, (ii) reveal that family-level microbial community analyses are insufficient to reveal important colitis-associated microbiota shifts and (iii) support a scenario of shifting intra-family structure and function in the phylotype-rich and phylogenetically diverse lachnospiraceae in dss-treated mice.

AB  == a strictly anoxic, gram-stain-positive, non-motile blautia-like bacterium, designated strain m25(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. strain m25(t)  was negative for both catalase and oxidase activity, utilized carbohydrates as fermentable substrates, produced lactate and acetate as the major end products of glucose fermentation in pyg medium, and had a dna g+c content of 41.6 mol%. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that strain m25(t) was closely related to ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (96.40 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity) and blautia glucerasea hfth-1(t) (96.17 %) within the family lachnospiraceae. straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated cellular fatty acids were also detected, the majority being c(14 : 0), c(16 : 0) and c(16 : 0) dimethyl acetal acids. based on the phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics presented in this study, strain m25(t) represents a novel species within the genus blautia for which the name blautia faecis sp. nov. is proposed.  the type strain is m25(t) ( = kctc 5980(t) = jcm 17205(t)).

TI  == acinetobacter, aeromonas and trichococcus populations dominate the microbial community within urban sewer infrastructure.
AB  == we evaluated the population structure and temporal dynamics of the dominant community members within sewage influent from two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) in milwaukee, wi. we generated > 1.1 m bacterial pyrotag sequences from the v6 hypervariable region of 16s rrna genes from 38 influent samples and two samples taken upstream in the sanitary sewer system. only a small fraction of pyrotags from influent samples ( approximately 15%) matched sequences from human  faecal samples. the faecal components of the sewage samples included enriched pyrotag populations from lactococcus and enterobacteriaceae relative to their fractional representation in human faecal samples. in contrast to the large number of distinct pyrotags that represent faecal bacteria such as lachnospiraceae and bacteroides, only one or two unique v6 sequences represented  acinetobacter, aeromonas and trichococcus, which collectively account for nearly  35% of the total sewage community. two dominant acinetobacter v6 pyrotags (designated acineto tag 1 and acineto tag 2) fluctuated inversely with a seasonal pattern over a 3-year period, suggesting two distinct acinetobacter populations respond differently to ecological forcings in the system. a single nucleotide change in the v6 pyrotags accounted for the difference in these populations and corresponded to two phylogenetically distinct clades based on full-length sequences. analysis of wavelet functions, derived from a mathematical model of temporal fluctuations, demonstrated that other abundant sewer associated populations including trichococcus and aeromonas had temporal patterns similar to either acineto tag 1 or acineto tag 2. populations with related temporal fluctuations were found to significantly correlate with the same wwtp variables (5-day bod, flow, ammonia, total phosphorous and suspended solids). these findings illustrate that small differences in v6 sequences can represent phylogenetically and ecologically distinct taxa. this work provides insight into  microbial community composition and dynamics within the defined environment of urban sewer infrastructure.

TI  == 'candidatus arthromitus' revised: segmented filamentous bacteria in arthropod guts are members of lachnospiraceae.
AB  == the name arthromitus has been applied collectively to conspicuous filamentous bacteria found in the hindguts of termites and other arthropods. first observed by joseph leidy in 1849, the identity of these filaments has remained contentious. while margulis and colleagues declared them to be a life stage of bacillus cereus, others have assumed them to belong to the same lineage as the segmented filamentous bacteria (sfb) from vertebrate guts, a group that has garnered much attention due to their unique ability to specifically modulate their host's immune response. both sfb and arthromitus filaments from arthropod guts were grouped under provisional name 'candidatus arthromitus' by snel and colleagues as they share a striking similarity in terms of their morphology and close contact to the host gut wall. while sfb form a distinct lineage within the  family clostridiaceae, the identity of the filaments from arthropod guts remains  elusive. using whole-genome amplification of single filaments capillary picked from termite guts and fluorescence in situ hybridization of 16s rrna with group-specific oligonucleotide probes, we show that they represent a monophyletic lineage within the family lachnospiraceae distinct from that of sfb. therefore, 'candidatus arthromitus' can no longer be used for both groups. given the historic precedence, we propose to reserve this name for the filaments that were  originally described by leidy. for the sfb from vertebrate guts, we propose the provisional name 'candidatus savagella' in honour of the american gut microbiologist dwayne c. savage, who was the first to describe that important bacterial group.

TI  == gut bacteria profiles of mus musculus at the phylum and family levels are influenced by saturation of dietary fatty acids.
AB  == background: mammalian gut microbiota have been implicated in a variety of functions including the breakdown of ingested nutrients, the regulation of energy intake and storage, the control of immune system development and activity, and the synthesis of novel chemicals. previous studies have shown that feeding mammalian hosts a high-fat diet shifts gut bacteria at the phylum level to reduce the ratio of bacteroidetes-to-firmicutes, while feeding hosts a fat-restricted diet increases this ratio. however, few studies have investigated the differential effects of fatty acid type on gut bacterial profile. methods: over a 14-week period, mus musculus were fed a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufas), omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 pufas), or saturated fatty acids (sfas). fecal pellets were collected before and after the treatment period from 12 randomly selected mice (4 per treatment group). bacterial dna was extracted from the pellets and characterized by analysis of the hypervariable v3 region of the 16s rrna. nominal logistic regression models were  used to assess shifts in microbial profile at the phylum and family levels in response to diet. results: a significant decrease in the proportion of phylum bacteroidetes species was observed for mice fed any of the three diets over time. however, the sfa-rich diet group showed a significantly greater decrease in bacteroidetes proportion (-28%) than did either the n-3 pufa group (-10%) or the  n-6 pufa group (-12%). at the family level, a significant decrease in proportion  of porphyromonadaceae was observed for mice fed the n-6 pufa-rich diet, and a significant decrease in proportion of lachnospiraceae was observed for mice fed the sfa-rich diet. there was no significant effect of diet type on body mass change. conclusion: our results indicate that sfas have stronger effects than pufas in shifting gut microbiota profiles toward those typical of obese individuals, and that dietary fatty acid saturation influences shifts in gut microbiota independently of changes in body mass.

TI  == methanogen colonisation does not significantly alter acetogen diversity in lambs  isolated 17 h after birth and raised aseptically.
AB  == reductive acetogenesis is not competitive with methanogenesis in adult ruminants, whereas acetogenic bacteria are the dominant hydrogenotrophs in the early rumen microbiota. the ecology of hydrogenotrophs in the developing rumen was investigated using young lambs, raised in sterile isolators, and conventional adult sheep. two lambs were born naturally, left with their dams for 17 h and then placed into a sterile isolator and reared aseptically. they were inoculated  with cellulolytic bacteria and later with methanobrevibacter sp. 87.7 to investigate the effect of methanogen establishment on the rumen acetogen population since they lacked cultivable representatives of methanogens. putative  acetogens were investigated by acetyl-coa synthase and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase gene analysis and methanogens by methyl coenzyme reductase a gene analysis. unexpectedly, a low abundant but diverse population of methanogens (predominantly methanobrevibacter spp.) was identified in isolated lambs pre-inoculation with mbb. sp 87.7, which was similar to the community structure in conventional sheep. in contrast, potential acetogen diversity in isolated lambs and conventional sheep was different. potential acetogens affiliated between the lachnospiraceae and clostridiaceae in conventional sheep and with the blautia genus and the lachnospiraceae in isolated lambs. the establishment of mbb. sp. 87.7 (1,000-fold increase in methanogens) did not substantially affect acetogen diversity.

AB  == anaerobic enrichments at ph 10, with pectin and polygalacturonates as substrates  and inoculated with samples of sediments of hypersaline soda lakes from the kulunda steppe (altai, russia) demonstrated the potential for microbial pectin degradation up to soda-saturating conditions. the enrichments resulted in the isolation of six strains of obligately anaerobic fermentative bacteria, which represented a novel deep lineage within the order clostridiales loosely associated with the family lachnospiraceae. the isolates were rod-shaped and formed terminal round endospores. one of the striking features of the novel group is a very narrow substrate spectrum for growth, restricted to galacturonic acid and its polymers (e.g. pectin). acetate and formate were the final fermentation products. growth was possible in a ph range from 8 to 10.5, with an optimum at ph 9.5-10, and in a salinity range from 0.2 to 3.5 m na(+). on the basis of unique phenotypic properties and distinct phylogeny, the pectinolytic isolates are proposed to be assigned to a new genus natranaerovirga with two species n. hydrolytica (app2(t)=dsm24176(t)=uniqem u806(t)) and n. pectinivora (ap3(t)=dsm24629(t)=uniqem u805(t)).

TI  == fatty acid composition and bacterial community changes in the rumen fluid of lactating sheep fed sunflower oil plus incremental levels of marine algae.
AB  == supplementation of ruminant diets with plant oils and marine lipids is an effective strategy for lowering saturated fatty acid (fa) content and increasing  the concentration of cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid and long-chain n-3 fa in ruminant milk. however, changes in populations of ruminal microorganisms associated with altered biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated fa are not well characterized. twenty-five lactating assaf ewes were allocated at random to 1 of  5 treatments composed of dehydrated alfalfa hay and concentrates containing no additional lipid (control), or supplemented with 25 g of sunflower oil and 0 (so), 8 (soma(1)), 16 (soma(2)), or 24 (soma(3)) g of marine algae/kg of diet dry matter. on d 28 on diet, samples of rumen fluid were collected for lipid analysis and microbial dna extraction. appearance and identification of biohydrogenation intermediates was determined based on complementary gas chromatography and ag+-hplc analysis of fa methyl esters. total bacteria and the butyrivibrio group  were studied in microbial dna by terminal rflp analysis, and real-time pcr was used to quantify the known butyrivibrio bacteria that produce trans-11 18:1 or 18:0. dietary supplements of sunflower oil alone or in combination with marine algae altered the fa profile of rumen fluid, which was associated with changes in populations of specific bacteria. inclusion of marine algae in diets containing sunflower oil resulted in the accumulation of trans 18:1 and 10-o-18:0 and a marked decrease in 18:0 concentrations in rumen fluid. at the highest levels of supplementation (soma(2) and soma(3)), marine algae also promoted a shift in ruminal biohydrogenation pathways toward the formation of trans-10 18:1 at the expense of trans-11 18:1. changes in the concentration of biohydrogenation intermediates were not accompanied by significant variations in the abundance of  known cultivated ruminal bacteria capable of hydrogenating unsaturated fa. however, certain bacterial groups detected by terminal rflp (such as potentially  uncultured lachnospiraceae strains or quinella-related bacteria) exhibited variations in their relative frequency consistent with a potential role in one or more metabolic pathways of biohydrogenation in the rumen.

AB  == two novel obligately anaerobic, gram-stain-positive, saccharolytic and non-proteolytic spore-forming bacilli (strains cd3:22(t) and n1(t)) are described. strain cd3:22(t) was isolated from a biopsy of the small intestine of  a child with coeliac disease, and strain n1(t) from the saliva of a healthy young man. the cells of both strains were observed to be filamentous, approximately 5 to >20 microm long, some of them curving and with swellings. the novel organisms  produced h(2)s, nh(3), butyric acid and acetic acid as major metabolic end products. phylogenetic analyses, based on comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing, revealed close relationships (98% sequence similarity) between the two isolates,  as well as the type strain of eubacterium saburreum and four other lachnospiraceae bacterium-/e. saburreum-like organisms. this group of bacteria were clearly different from any of the 19 known genera in the family lachnospiraceae. while eubacterium species are reported to be non-spore-forming,  reanalysis of e. saburreum ccug 28089(t) confirmed that the bacterium is indeed able to form spores. based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, phenotypic and biochemical properties, strains cd3:22(t) and n1(t) represent novel species of a  new and distinct genus, named lachnoanaerobaculum gen. nov., in the family lachnospiraceae [within the order clostridiales, class clostridia, phylum firmicutes]. strain cd3:22(t) (=ccug 58757(t) =dsm 23576(t)) is the type strain of the type species, lachnoanaerobaculum umeaense gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed new genus. strain n1(t) (=ccug 60305(t)=dsm 24553(t)) is the type strain of lachnoanaerobaculum orale sp. nov. moreover, eubacterium saburreum is reclassified as lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum comb. nov.

AB  == background: chronic pouchitis is an important long-term complication following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. antibiotic administration reduces symptoms of pouchitis, indicating that bacteria have a role in pathogenesis. the aim of the research was to investigate the bacterial content of pouches using nucleic acid-based methods. methods: stool microbiota of 17 patients with normal pouches (np), 17 patients with pouchitis (cp) utilizing samples collected from each patient when antibiotic-treated (cp-on, asymptomatic) and when untreated (cp-off, symptomatic), and 14 familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) patients were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, fluorescence in situ  hybridization technologies, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results: fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed an expanded phylogenetic gap in np and cp-off patients relative to fap. antibiotic treatment  reduced the gap in cp stool. the phylogenetic gap of cp-off patients was due to members of the bacterial families caulobacteriaceae, sphingomonadaceae, comamonadaceae, peptostreptococcaceae, and clostridiaceae. there was a greater diversity of phylotypes of clostridiaceae in cp-off subjects. the phylogenetic gap of np stool was enriched by ruminococcaceae and bifidobacteriaceae. cp stool  microbiota had reduced diversity relative to np and fap stool due largely to a reduction in lachnospiraceae/insertae sedis xiv/clostridial cluster iv groups. conclusions: bacterial groups within the expanded phylogenetic gap of pouch patients may have roles in the pathogenesis of pouchitis. further research concerning the physiology of cultured members of these groups will be necessary to explain their specific roles. members of the lachnospiraceae, incertae sedis xiv, and clostridial cluster iv could be useful biomarkers of pouch health.

TI  == alterations in microbiota and fermentation products in equine large intestine in  response to dietary variation and intestinal disease.
AB  == we aimed to determine the effects of variations in dietary composition on equine  gut microbiota and their fermentation products, and proposed that dietary modifications profoundly affect microbial ecosystems and their metabolites. bacterial communities within the large intestine of three groups of horses were compared using oligonucleotide-rna hybridisation methodology. each group consisting of six horses was maintained on (1) a grass-only diet, (2) a concentrate diet (i.e. supplemented with hydrolysable carbohydrates) and (3) a concentrate diet but horses were affected by simple colonic obstruction and distension (scod), a prevalent form of dietary-induced intestinal disease. we show that in response to dietary change and intestinal disease, there is a progressive and significant increase in lachnospiraceae, the bacteroidetes assemblage and the lactic acid-producing, bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus (bls) group. in contrast, there is a corresponding decrease in the proportion of  obligate fibrolytic, acid-intolerant bacteria, fibrobacter and ruminococcaceae. assessment of monocarboxylic acids indicated that there are significantly higher  concentrations of lactic acid in the colonic contents of horses maintained on a concentrate diet and those suffering from scod, correlating with the observed increase in the population abundance of the bls group. however, the population size of the veillonellaceae (lactate utilisers) remained constant in each study group. the inability of this group to respond to increased lactic acid may be a contributory factor to the build-up of lactic acid observed in horses fed a concentrate diet and those suffering from scod.

TI  == lachnospiraceae and bacteroidales alternative fecal indicators reveal chronic human sewage contamination in an urban harbor.
AB  == the complexity of fecal microbial communities and overlap among human and other animal sources have made it difficult to identify source-specific fecal indicator bacteria. however, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies now provides increased sequencing power to resolve microbial community composition within and among environments. these data can be mined for information on source-specific phylotypes and/or assemblages of phylotypes (i.e., microbial signatures). we report the development of a new genetic marker for human fecal contamination identified through microbial pyrotag sequence analysis of the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. sequence analysis of 37 sewage samples and comparison with database sequences revealed a human-associated phylotype within the lachnospiraceae family, which was closely related to the genus blautia. this  phylotype, termed lachno2, was on average the second most abundant fecal bacterial phylotype in sewage influent samples from milwaukee, wi. we developed a quantitative pcr (qpcr) assay for lachno2 and used it along with the qpcr-based assays for human bacteroidales (based on the hf183 genetic marker), total bacteroidales spp., and enterococci and the conventional escherichia coli and enterococci plate count assays to examine the prevalence of fecal and human fecal pollution in milwaukee's harbor. both the conventional fecal indicators and the human-associated indicators revealed chronic fecal pollution in the harbor, with  significant increases following heavy rain events and combined sewer overflows. the two human-associated genetic marker abundances were tightly correlated in the harbor, a strong indication they target the same source (i.e., human sewage). human adenoviruses were routinely detected under all conditions in the harbor, and the probability of their occurrence increased by 154% for every 10-fold increase in the human indicator concentration. both lachno2 and human bacteroidales increased specificity to detect sewage compared to general indicators, and the relationship to a human pathogen group suggests that the use  of these alternative indicators will improve assessments for human health risks in urban waters.

TI  == variations in the 16s-23s rrna internal transcribed spacer of fibrolytic butyrivibrio isolates from the reindeer rumen.
AB  == strains of butyrivibrio are principal cellulytic bacteria in the rumen of the high arctic svalbard reindeer ( rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus ). according to phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing, butyrivibrio can be divided into three subgroups within the clostridia class of the phylum firmicutes, but the current phenotypic and genotypic differentiation within the family lachnospiraceae is insufficient. this current study describes the sequence diversity of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region of butyrivibrio isolates from reindeer. a total of 17 different its sequences with sizes between 449 and 784 nt were obtained. genes encoding trna(ile) and trna(ala) were identified in four of the sequences. phylogenetic neighbor-joining trees were constructed based on the its sequence and compared with a phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree based on 16s rrna gene sequences previously obtained for the same isolates. these comparisons indicated a better differentiation between strains in the its sequence than the 16s rrna gene based tree. through this study, a better means for identifying and tracking fibrolytic and potentially probiotic butyrivibrio strains in reindeer and other ruminants has been provided.

AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == changes in bacterial diversity associated with epithelial tissue in the beef cow  rumen during the transition to a high-grain diet.
AB  == our understanding of the ruminal epithelial tissue-associated bacterial (defined  as epimural bacteria in this study) community is limited. in this study, we aimed to determine whether diet influences the diversity of the epimural bacterial community in the bovine rumen. twenty-four beef heifers were randomly assigned to either a rapid grain adaptation (rga) treatment (n = 18) in which the heifers were allowed to adapt from a diet containing 97% hay to a diet containing 8% hay  over 29 days or to the control group (n = 6), which was fed 97% hay. rumen papillae were collected when the heifers were fed 97%, 25%, and 8% hay diets. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative real-time pcr analysis were used to characterize rumen epimural bacterial diversity and to estimate the total epimural bacterial population (copy numbers of the 16s rrna gene). the epimural bacterial diversity from rga heifers changed (p = 0.01) in response to the rapid dietary transition, whereas it was not affected in control  heifers. a total of 88 pcr-dgge bands were detected, and 44 were identified from  phyla including firmicutes, bacteroidetes, and proteobacteria. the bacteria treponema sp., ruminobacter sp., and lachnospiraceae sp. were detected only when  heifers were fed 25% and 8% hay diets, suggesting the presence of these bacteria  is the result of adaptation to the high-grain diets. in addition, the total estimated population of rumen epimural bacteria was positively correlated with molar proportions of acetate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate, suggesting that they  may play a role in volatile fatty acid metabolism in the rumen.

TI  == diversity of the autochthonous colonic microbiota.
AB  == a longstanding hypothesis in intestinal microbial ecology is that autochthonous microbes (resident) play a role that is distinct from allochthonous microbes (transient microbes in the fecal stream). a challenge has been to identify this pool of microbes. we used laser capture microdissection to collect microbes from  the mouse ascending colon. this area contains transverse folds that mimic human intestinal folds and contains a distinct population of intestinal microbes that is associated with the mucosa. our analysis of bacterial 16s rrna genes showed that this area was enriched for lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. in this addendum, we further compare this community to studies of mucosa-associated microbes in humans. this analysis reveals common phylogenetic groups of bacteria  that are present in both mouse and human. however, we found microorganisms at the genus and species levels including faecalibacterium prausnitzii which appears to  be specific for humans. we propose that that examination of the mucosa-associated microbes in wild type and genetically modified mice will be a valuable component  to define host microbial interactions that are essential for homeostasis.

TI  == twin study indicates loss of interaction between microbiota and mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background & aims: interactions between genetic and environmental factors are believed to be involved in onset and initiation of inflammatory bowel disease. we analyzed the interaction between gastrointestinal mucosal microbiota and host genes in twin pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis (uc) to study the functional interaction between microbiota and mucosal epithelium. methods: biopsy were collected from sigmoid colon of uc patients and their healthy twins (discordant twin pairs) and from twins without uc. microbiota profiles were determined from analysis of 16s ribosomal dna libraries; messenger rna profiles were determined by microarray analysis. results: patients with uc had dysbiotic microbiota, characterized by less bacterial diversity and more actinobacteria and proteobacteria than that of their healthy siblings; healthy siblings from discordant twins had more bacteria from the lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae families than twins who were both healthy. in twins who were both healthy, 34 mucosal transcripts correlated with bacterial genera, whereas only 25 and 11 correlated with bacteria genera in healthy individuals and their twins with uc, respectively. transcripts related to oxidative and immune responses were differentially expressed between patients with uc and their healthy twins. conclusions: the transcriptional profile of the mucosa appears to interact with the colonic microbiota; this interaction appears to be lost in colon of patients  with uc. bacterial functions, such as butyrate production, might affect mucosal gene expression. patients with uc had different gene expression profiles and lower levels of biodiversity than their healthy twins, as well as unusual aerobic bacteria. patients with uc had lower percentages of potentially protective bacterial species than their healthy twins.

TI  == characterization of fecal microbial communities in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  == liver cirrhosis is the pathologic end stage of chronic liver disease. increasing  evidence suggests that gut flora is implicated in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis complications. the aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbial community in patients with liver cirrhosis in comparison with healthy individuals. we recruited 36 patients with liver cirrhosis and 24 healthy controls. the fecal microbial communities was analyzed by way of 454 pyrosequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna v3 region followed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. community-wide changes of fecal microbiota in liver cirrhosis were observed compared with healthy controls. the proportion of phylum bacteroidetes was significantly reduced (p=0.008), whereas proteobacteria and fusobacteria were highly enriched in the cirrhosis group (p=0.001 and 0.002, respectively). enterobacteriaceae (p=0.001), veillonellaceae  (p=0.046), and streptococcaceae (p=0.001) were prevalent in patients with cirrhosis at the family level. a positive correlation was observed between child-turcotte-pugh (ctp) score and streptococcaceae (r=0.386, p=0.02). lachnospiraceae decreased significantly in patients with cirrhosis (p=0.004) and  correlated negatively with ctp score (r=-0.49, p=0.002). using partial least square discriminate analysis, we identified 149 operational taxonomic units (otus) as key phylotypes that responded to cirrhosis, most of which were lachnospiraceae (65 otus), streptococcaceae (23 otus), and veillonellaceae (21 otus). conclusion: fecal microbial communities are distinct in patients with cirrhosis compared with healthy individuals. the prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacteriaceae and streptococcaceae, with the reduction of beneficial populations such as lachnospiraceae in patients with cirrhosis may affect prognosis.

AB  == strain gam6-1t is a novel, strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-stain-positive bacterium that was isolated from the faeces of a healthy individual. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences indicated that strain gam6-1t was most closely related to blautia producta atcc 27340t (95.7 % sequence similarity), in the family lachnospiraceae. strain gam6-1t did not exhibit catalase or oxidase activity. the strain's cellular fatty acids were of the straight-chain saturated and mono-unsaturated types, with c14:0 (24.10 %), c16:0 (19.09 %) and c16:0 dimethylacetal (14.35 %) predominant. strain gam6-1t was able to produce acid from various carbohydrates. glucose fermentation produced acetic acid as the major short-chain fatty acid. the genomic dna g+c content of strain gam6-1t was 35.6 mol%. based on phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic evidence, strain gam6-1t (=kctc 5981t=jcm 17204t) is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name blautia stercoris sp. nov. is proposed.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of the fecal microbial community in herbivorous land and marine iguanas of the galapagos islands using 16s rrna-based pyrosequencing.
AB  == herbivorous reptiles depend on complex gut microbial communities to effectively degrade dietary polysaccharides. the composition of these fermentative communities may vary based on dietary differences. to explore the role of diet in shaping gut microbial communities, we evaluated the fecal samples from two related host species--the algae-consuming marine iguana (amblyrhynchus cristatus) and land iguanas (li) (genus conolophus) that consume terrestrial vegetation. marine and li fecal samples were collected from different islands in the galapagos archipelago. high-throughput 16s rrna-based pyrosequencing was used to  provide a comparative analysis of fecal microbial diversity. at the phylum level, the fecal microbial community in iguanas was predominated by firmicutes (69.5+/-7.9%) and bacteroidetes (6.2+/-2.8%), as well as unclassified bacteria (20.6+/-8.6%), suggesting that a large portion of iguana fecal microbiota is novel and could be involved in currently unknown functions. host species differed in the abundance of specific bacterial groups. bacteroides spp., lachnospiraceae  and clostridiaceae were significantly more abundant in the marine iguanas (mi) (p-value>1e-9). in contrast, ruminococcaceae were present at >5-fold higher abundance in the li than mi (p-value>6e-14). archaea were only detected in the li. the number of operational taxonomic units (otus) in the li (356-896 otus) was >2-fold higher than in the mi (112-567 otus), and this increase in otu diversity  could be related to the complexity of the resident bacterial population and their gene repertoire required to breakdown the recalcitrant polysaccharides prevalent  in terrestrial plants. our findings suggest that dietary differences contribute to gut microbial community differentiation in herbivorous lizards. most importantly, this study provides a better understanding of the microbial diversity in the iguana gut; therefore facilitating future efforts to discover novel bacterial-associated enzymes that can effectively breakdown a wide variety  of complex polysaccharides.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

TI  == as yet uncultured bacteria phylogenetically classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and  ruminococcaceae may play a predominant role in ruminal biohydrogenation.
AB  == microbial biohydrogenation of dietary poly-unsaturated fatty acids (pufa) to saturated fatty acids (sfa) in the rumen results in the high ratio of sfa/pufa in ruminant products, such as meat and milk. in vitro, butyrivibrio proteoclasticus-related bacteria extensively biohydrogenate pufa to sfa, yet their contribution in the rumen has not been confirmed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group bacteria in ruminal biohydrogenation and to assess the possible role of other bacteria. fish oil at 0%, 1.5% and 3% dry matter intake was fed to eight holstein x friesian steers, in order to elicit changes in the extent of pufa biohydrogenation. fatty acid and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentrations in rumen digesta were determined. correlation between digesta 18:0 concentration and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentration was low. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) coupled with multivariate statistics revealed that many terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) and dgge bands were linked to cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla), 18:1 trans-11 and 18:0 ruminal concentrations. mica t-rf predictive identification software showed that these linked t-rfs were likely to originate from as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and ruminococcaceae. sequencing of linked dgge bands also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, anaerovoax (member of the lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified clostridiales and ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation.

TI  == metatranscriptomic approach to analyze the functional human gut microbiota.
AB  == the human gut is the natural habitat for a large and dynamic bacterial community  that has a great relevance for health. metagenomics is increasing our knowledge of gene content as well as of functional and genetic variability in this microbiome. however, little is known about the active bacteria and their function(s) in the gastrointestinal tract. we performed a metatranscriptomic study on ten healthy volunteers to elucidate the active members of the gut microbiome and their functionality under conditions of health. first, the microbial cdnas obtained from each sample were sequenced using 454 technology. the analysis of 16s transcripts showed the phylogenetic structure of the active microbial community. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, bacteroidaceae, prevotellaceae, and rickenellaceae were the predominant families detected in the  active microbiota. the characterization of mrnas revealed a uniform functional pattern in healthy individuals. the main functional roles of the gut microbiota were carbohydrate metabolism, energy production and synthesis of cellular components. in contrast, housekeeping activities such as amino acid and lipid metabolism were underrepresented in the metatranscriptome. our results provide new insights into the functionality of the complex gut microbiota in healthy individuals. in this rna-based survey, we also detected small rnas, which are important regulatory elements in prokaryotic physiology and pathogenicity.

AB  == knowledge of the composition of a normal healthy gut microbiota during infancy is important for understanding the role of gut microbiota in disease. a limitation of previous studies is that they are based on infants who have been subject to factors, which can have a profound disruptive effect on the natural colonization  process. we describe the colonization process, during the first 4 months after birth, in 85 infants who have experienced no major medical or dietary interventions. they were all vaginally delivered, healthy, term infants, who were not exposed to antibiotics, exclusively breastfed during their first month of life and at least partially breastfed up to 4 months. selected microbial groups were identified by targeting small subunit microbial ribosomal rna genes. in contrast to more recent studies, but in agreement with older studies, almost all  our infants harbored gamma-proteobacteria and bifidobacterium. yet undefined non-cultivable species belonging to bacteroides, as well as microbes identified as lachnospiraceae 2, were common. strong associations were observed between some specific constituents of microbiota at day 4 and the concentration of specific microbial groups at day 120, indicating that early gut microbiota may influence later microbiota. novel information of the undisturbed composition of early gut microbiota in babies is presented.

TI  == spatial organization of intestinal microbiota in the mouse ascending colon.
AB  == complex microbial populations are organized in relation to their environment. in  the intestine, the inner lining (mucosa) is a potential focal point for such organization. the proximal murine colon contains mucosal folds that are known to  be associated with morphologically distinct microbes. to identify these microbes, we used the technique of laser capture microdissection (lcm) to sample microbes associated with these folds (interfold region) and within the central lumen (digesta region). using 16s rrna gene tag pyrosequencing, we found that microbes  in the interfold region were highly enriched for the phylum firmicutes and, more  specifically, for the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. other families such as bacteroidaceae, enterococcaceae and lactobacillaceae were all enriched in the digesta region. this high-resolution system to capture and examine spatial organization of intestinal microbes should facilitate microbial analysis in other mouse models, furthering our understanding of host-microbial interactions.

TI  == deglycosylation of puerarin and other aromatic c-glucosides by a newly isolated human intestinal bacterium.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota may influence the fate of bioactive polyphenols,  such as the isoflavone puerarin (daidzein 8-c-glucoside), following their oral intake. faecal suspensions from 19 healthy subjects were tested for their ability to c-deglycosylate puerarin. only one of these catalysed this reaction. a rod-shaped gram-positive bacterium, strain cg19-1, capable of deglycosylating puerarin to daidzein was isolated from the corresponding suspension. however, the strictly anaerobic isolate was unable to utilize puerarin as sole carbon and energy source nor any of the tested carbohydrates. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that strain cg19-1 is a new species of the lachnospiraceae. strain cg19-1 also converted other aromatic c-glucosides in addition to puerarin. the xanthone c-glucoside mangiferin was deglycosylated to norathyriol. the flavone c-glucosides homoorientin and vitexin were degraded to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid via luteolin and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid respectively. in addition, strain cg19-1 converted flavonoid o-glucosides, but at rates that were lower than those of the  c-glucosides tested. the isolate deglycosylated the isoflavone o-glucosides daidzin and genistin to daidzein and genistein respectively. several o-glucosides of the flavones luteolin and apigenin undergoing deglycosylation were subsequently cleaved to 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid respectively. moreover, strain cg19-1 cleaved both o-desmethylangolensin and 6'-hydroxy-o-desmethylangolensin to yield 2-(4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. the corresponding cleavage product, resorcinol, was only observed for o-desmethylangolensin.

TI  == functional gene analysis suggests different acetogen populations in the bovine rumen and tammar wallaby forestomach.
AB  == reductive acetogenesis via the acetyl coenzyme a (acetyl-coa) pathway is an alternative hydrogen sink to methanogenesis in the rumen. functional gene-based analysis is the ideal approach for investigating organisms capable of this metabolism (acetogens). however, existing tools targeting the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase gene (fhs) are compromised by lack of specificity due to the involvement of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (fthfs) in other pathways. acetyl-coa synthase (acs) is unique to the acetyl-coa pathway  and, in the present study, acetyl-coa synthase genes (acsb) were recovered from a range of acetogens to facilitate the design of acsb-specific pcr primers. fhs and acsb libraries were used to examine acetogen diversity in the bovine rumen and forestomach of the tammar wallaby (macropus eugenii), a native australian marsupial demonstrating foregut fermentation analogous to rumen fermentation but  resulting in lower methane emissions. novel, deduced amino acid sequences of acsb and fhs affiliated with the lachnospiraceae in both ecosystems and the ruminococcaeae/blautia group in the rumen. fthfs sequences that probably originated from nonacetogens were identified by low "homoacetogen similarity" scores based on analysis of fthfs residues, and comprised a large proportion of fthfs sequences from the tammar wallaby forestomach. a diversity of fthfs and acs sequences in both ecosystems clustered between the lachnospiraceae and clostridiaceae acetogens but without close sequences from cultured isolates. these sequences probably originated from novel acetogens. the community structures of the acsb and fhs libraries from the rumen and the tammar wallaby forestomach were different (libshuff, p < 0.001), and these differences may have  significance for overall hydrogenotrophy in both ecosystems.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of microbial communities in the rumens of cattle fed different diets.
AB  == at present there is little quantitative information on the identity and composition of bacterial populations in the rumen microbial community. quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization using newly designed oligonucleotide probes was applied to identify the microbial populations in liquid and solid fractions of rumen digesta from cows fed barley silage or grass  hay diets with or without flaxseed. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria were abundant in both fractions, constituting 31.8 to 87.3% of the total cell numbers. they belong mainly to the order bacteroidales (0.1 to 19.2%), hybridizing with probe bac1080; the families lachnospiraceae (9.3 to 25.5%) and ruminococcaceae (5.5 to 23.8%), hybridizing with lac435 and rum831, respectively; and the classes deltaproteobacteria (5.8 to 28.3%) and gammaproteobacteria (1.2 to 8.2%). all were more abundant in the rumen communities of cows fed diets containing silage (75.2 to 87.3%) than in those of cows fed diets containing hay  (31.8 to 49.5%). the addition of flaxseed reduced their abundance in the rumens of cows fed silage-based diets (to 45.2 to 58.7%) but did not change markedly their abundance in the rumens of cows fed hay-based diets (31.8 to 49.5%). fibrolytic species, including fibrobacter succinogenes and ruminococcus spp., and archaeal methanogens accounted for only a small proportion (0.4 to 2.1% and 0.2 to 0.6%, respectively) of total cell numbers. depending on diet, between 37.0 and 91.6% of microbial cells specifically hybridized with the probes used in this study, allowing them to be identified in situ. the identities of other microbial  populations (8.4 to 63.0%) remain unknown.

AB  == background: women living with hiv and co-infected with bacterial vaginosis (bv) are at higher risk for transmitting hiv to a partner or newborn. it is poorly understood which bacterial communities constitute bv or the normal vaginal microbiota among this population and how the microbiota associated with bv responds to antibiotic treatment. methods and findings: the vaginal microbiota of 132 hiv positive tanzanian women, including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for bv, were profiled using illumina to sequence the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. of note, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners were detected in each sample constituting core members of the vaginal microbiota. eight major clusters were detected with relatively uniform microbiota compositions. two clusters dominated by l. iners or l. crispatus were strongly associated with a normal microbiota. the l. crispatus dominated microbiota were associated with low ph, but when l. crispatus was not present, a large fraction of l. iners was required to predict a low ph. four clusters were strongly associated with bv, and were dominated by prevotella bivia, lachnospiraceae, or a mixture of different species. metronidazole treatment reduced the microbial diversity and perturbed the bv-associated microbiota, but rarely resulted in the  establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. conclusions: illumina based microbial profiling enabled high though-put analyses of microbial samples at a high phylogenetic resolution. the vaginal microbiota among women living with hiv  in sub-saharan africa constitutes several profiles associated with a normal microbiota or bv. recurrence of bv frequently constitutes a different bv-associated profile than before antibiotic treatment.

TI  == muramidases found in the foregut microbiome of the tammar wallaby can direct cell aggregation and biofilm formation.
AB  == we describe here the role of muramidases present in clones of metagenomic dna that result in cell aggregation and biofilm formation by escherichia coli. the metagenomic clones were obtained from uncultured lachnospiraceae-affiliated bacteria resident in the foregut microbiome of the tammar wallaby. one of these fosmid clones (p49c2) was chosen for more detailed studies and a variety of genetic methods were used to delimit the region responsible for the phenotype to  an open reading frame of 1425 bp. comparative sequence analysis with other fosmid clones giving rise to the same phenotype revealed the presence of muramidase homologues with the same modular composition. phylogenetic analysis of the fosmid sequence data assigned these fosmid inserts to recently identified, but uncultured, phylogroups of lachnospiraceae believed to be numerically dominant in the foregut microbiome of the tammar wallaby. the muramidase is a modular protein containing putative n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase and an endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase catalytic module, with a similar organization and functional properties to some staphylococcal autolysins that also confer adhesive properties and biofilm formation. we also show here that the cloned muramidases result in the production of extracellular dna, which appears to be the key for biofilm formation and autoaggregation. collectively, these findings suggest that biofilm formation and cell aggregation in gut microbiomes might occur via the concerted action of carbohydrate-active enzymes and the production  of extracellular dna to serve as a biofilm scaffold.

TI  == adaptation to herbivory by the tammar wallaby includes bacterial and glycoside hydrolase profiles different from other herbivores.
AB  == metagenomic and bioinformatic approaches were used to characterize plant biomass  conversion within the foregut microbiome of australia's "model" marsupial, the tammar wallaby (macropus eugenii). like the termite hindgut and bovine rumen, key enzymes and modular structures characteristic of the "free enzyme" and "cellulosome" paradigms of cellulose solubilization remain either poorly represented or elusive to capture by shotgun sequencing methods. instead, multigene polysaccharide utilization loci-like systems coupled with genes encoding beta-1,4-endoglucanases and beta-1,4-endoxylanases--which have not been  previously encountered in metagenomic datasets--were identified, as were a diverse set of glycoside hydrolases targeting noncellulosic polysaccharides. furthermore, both rrs gene and other phylogenetic analyses confirmed that unique  clades of the lachnospiraceae, bacteroidales, and gammaproteobacteria are predominant in the tammar foregut microbiome. nucleotide composition-based sequence binning facilitated the assemblage of more than two megabase pairs of genomic sequence for one of the novel lachnospiraceae clades (wg-2). these analyses show that wg-2 possesses numerous glycoside hydrolases targeting noncellulosic polysaccharides. these collective data demonstrate that australian  macropods not only harbor unique bacterial lineages underpinning plant biomass conversion, but their repertoire of glycoside hydrolases is distinct from those of the microbiomes of higher termites and the bovine rumen.

TI  == changes in the rumen bacterial community in response to sunflower oil and fish oil supplements in the diet of dairy sheep.
AB  == rumen microbial biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated fatty acids has a major effect on the process of developing healthier dairy products. this study aimed to investigate in vivo the effect of diet supplementation with sunflower (so) and fish (fo) oils on the rumen bacterial community in dairy sheep. first, 32 lactating ewes, divided in 8 lots of 4 animals each (2 lots per treatment), were  fed a high-concentrate total mixed ration supplemented with 0, 2% so, 1% fo, or 2% so plus 1% fo. after 21 d, rumen fluid samples were taken from each lot for dna extraction and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis. in a second experiment, 5 cannulated ewes were first fed the same tmr, with the exception of a higher forage level, and then changed to the same diet supplemented with 2% so plus 1% fo. after 0, 3, and 10 d, rumen content samples were taken for dna extraction and fish analysis (fluid). total bacteria and the butyrivibrio group were studied in microbial dna by terminal rflp analysis (t-rflp), and real-time pcr was used to quantify butyrivibrio bacteria that produce vaccenic acid or stearic acid. in rumen fluid samples, total bacteria and clostridial clusters ix and xiv were analyzed by fish. dietary supplementation with so plus fo seemed to induce important changes in the total bacteria and butyrivibrio populations, and a high interindividual variation was observed, and  the speed of the effect of the lipid supplementation depended on the individual microbial composition. analysis by t-rflp and fish showed increases in cluster ix bacteria with so plus fo supplementation, presumably quinella-like microorganisms. the abundances of vaccenic acid- and stearic acid-producing butyrivibrio relative to total bacteria, estimated by real time pcr, were low (0.28 and 0.18%, respectively, in rumen fluid, and 0.86 and 0.81% in rumen contents) and only that of sa-producing bacteria seemed to be reduced by diets containing fo, although differences were only significant in lactating ewes. the  t-rflp analysis showed a variable effect of lipid supplementation on different bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae, which includes the cultured bacteria known to be actively involved in rumen biohydrogenation. these results suggest that the latter bacteria do not play a dominant role in this process, and therefore other as-yet-uncultivated microorganisms might be more relevant.

TI  == a metagenomic beta-glucuronidase uncovers a core adaptive function of the human intestinal microbiome.
AB  == in the human gastrointestinal tract, bacterial beta-d-glucuronidases (bg; e.c. 3.2.1.31) are involved both in xenobiotic metabolism and in some of the beneficial effects of dietary compounds. despite their biological significance, investigations are hampered by the fact that only a few bgs have so far been studied. a functional metagenomic approach was therefore performed on intestinal  metagenomic libraries using chromogenic glucuronides as probes. using this strategy, 19 positive metagenomic clones were identified but only one exhibited strong beta-d-glucuronidase activity when subcloned into an expression vector. the cloned gene encoded a beta-d-glucuronidase (called h11g11-bg) that had distant amino acid sequence homologies and an additional c terminus domain compared with known beta-d-glucuronidases. fifteen homologs were identified in public bacterial genome databases (38-57% identity with h11g11-bg) in the firmicutes phylum. the genomes identified derived from strains from ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and clostridiaceae. the genetic context diversity, with closely related symporters and gene duplication, argued for functional diversity and contribution to adaptive mechanisms. in contrast to the  previously known beta-d-glucuronidases, this previously undescribed type was present in the published microbiome of each healthy adult/child investigated (n = 11) and was specific to the human gut ecosystem. in conclusion, our functional metagenomic approach revealed a class of bgs that may be part of a functional core specifically evolved to adapt to the human gut environment with major health implications. we propose consensus motifs for this unique firmicutes beta-d-glucuronidase subfamily and for the glycosyl hydrolase family 2.

TI  == organismal, genetic, and transcriptional variation in the deeply sequenced gut microbiomes of identical twins.
AB  == we deeply sampled the organismal, genetic, and transcriptional diversity in fecal samples collected from a monozygotic (mz) twin pair and compared the results to 1,095 communities from the gut and other body habitats of related and unrelated individuals. using a new scheme for noise reduction in pyrosequencing data, we estimated the total diversity of species-level bacterial phylotypes in the 1.2-1.5 million bacterial 16s rrna reads obtained from each deeply sampled cotwin to be approximately 800 (35.9%, 49.1% detected in both). a combined 1.1 million read 16s rrna dataset representing 281 shallowly sequenced fecal samples from 54  twin pairs and their mothers contained an estimated 4,018 species-level phylotypes, with each sample having a unique species assemblage (53.4 +/- 0.6% and 50.3 +/- 0.5% overlap with the deeply sampled cotwins). of the 134 phylotypes with a relative abundance of >0.1% in the combined dataset, only 37 appeared in >50% of the samples, with one phylotype in the lachnospiraceae family present in  99%. nongut communities had significantly reduced overlap with the deeply sequenced twins' fecal microbiota (18.3 +/- 0.3%, 15.3 +/- 0.3%). the mz cotwins' fecal dna was deeply sequenced (3.8-6.3 gbp/sample) and assembled reads were assigned to 25 genus-level phylogenetic bins. only 17% of the genes in these bins were shared between the cotwins. bins exhibited differences in their degree of sequence variation, gene content including the repertoire of carbohydrate active  enzymes present within and between twins (e.g., predicted cellulases, dockerins), and transcriptional activities. these results provide an expanded perspective about features that make each of us unique life forms and directions for future characterization of our gut ecosystems.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences reveals distal gut bacterial diversity in wild wolves (canis lupus).
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the microbial communities in the distal gut of wild wolves (canis lupus). fecal samples were collected from three healthy unrelated adult wolves captured at the nearby of dalai lake nature reserve in inner mongolia of china. the diversity of fecal bacteria was investigated by constructing pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene clone libraries using the universal bacterial primers 27 f and 1493 r. a total of 307 non-chimeric near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed and 65 non-redundant bacteria phylotypes (operational taxonomical units, otus) were identified. seventeen otus (26%) showed less than 98% sequence similarity to 16s rrna gene sequences were reported previously. five different bacterial phyla were identified, with the majority of  otus being classified within the phylum firmicutes (60%), followed by bacteroidetes (16.9%), proteobacteria (9.2%), fusobacteria (9.2%) and actinobacteria (4.6%). the majority of clones fell within the order clostridiales (53.8% of otus). it was predominantly affiliated with five families: lachnospiraceae was the most diverse bacterial family in this order, followed by  ruminococcaceae, clostridiaceae, peptococcaceae and peptostreptococcaceae.

TI  == lactobacilli are prominent in the initial stages of polymicrobial infection of dental pulp.
AB  == in earlier studies we used molecular methods to identify the major bacterial consortia associated with advanced dentin caries. these consortia are dominated by bacteria from the families lactobacillaceae, streptococcaceae, veillonellaceae (formerly acidaminococcaceae), eubacteriaceae, and lachnospiraceae from the phylum firmicutes; coriobacteriaceae, bifidobacteriaceae, and propionibacteriaceae from the phylum actinobacteria; and prevotellaceae from the  phylum bacteroidetes, as well as fusobacteria. the phases of infection of vital pulp tissue by dentin microorganisms remain obscure. in the present study, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on sections of tissue embedded in resin. probes for 16s rrna corresponding to the major taxa of bacteria in carious dentin were used to provide information on the characteristics of pulp infection. lactobacilli were prominent in 7 of 8 pulps determined to be at a limited stage of infection. established infection (6 pulps) showed a more complex profile, with lactobacilli persisting in all of the lesions and with invasion of  the necrotic regions of tissue by bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, lachnospiraceae, and coriobacteriaceae in particular. advanced infections (7 pulps) were characterized by mixed anaerobic species, with a strong representation by coriobacteriaceae and lachnospiraceae. lactobacilli were not represented at this  stage. typically, groups of organisms were spatially isolated within the pulp tissue. analysis indicated that lactobacilli could invade vital pulp tissue to achieve a very high biomass that was not associated with a detectable local inflammatory infiltrate. the findings establish that invasion of the dental pulp  can be associated with a pronounced selection from the complex microbial populations within carious dentin, suggesting specific pathogenicity.

TI  == developmental microbial ecology of the crop of the folivorous hoatzin.
AB  == the hoatzin (opisthocomus hoazin) is a south american strict folivorous bird, with a crop microbial ecosystem that ferments dietary plants. chicks progressively become independent from the adult-fed regurgitated crop liquids, and we hypothesized that the crop bacterial ecosystem develops through ecological succession mechanisms, as they grow into adults. the aim of this work was to compare the crop bacterial community in hoatzins from three age groups: newly hatched chicks, juveniles and adults by sequencing 16s rrna genes and using the g2 phylochip. cloning yielded a total of 2123 nearly full-length sequences binned into 294 operational taxonomic units (otus) (with <97% homology) belonging to 7 phyla, with 91% of novel otus. the microarray identified a diverse bacterial community dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes, with approximately 1400 taxa grouped in 40 phyla that included those detected by cloning. in comparison with the adult, the hoatzin chick crop had a greater abundance of flavobacteriaceae, clostridiaceae and lachnospiraceae but lacked phyla dss1, deferribacteres and termite group 1, which were mostly present in adults. the overall community structure of the crop of the hoatzin changes with age in a complex manner, probably responding to new niches made available through dietary changes related  to the transition from dependent to independent feeding.

TI  == microbial community analysis reveals high level phylogenetic alterations in the overall gastrointestinal microbiota of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome sufferers.
AB  == background: a growing amount of scientific evidence suggests that microbes are involved in the aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), and the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota of individuals suffering from diarrhoea-predominant ibs (ibs-d) is distinguishable from other ibs-subtypes. in  our study, the gi microbiota of ibs-d patients was evaluated and compared with healthy controls (hc) by using a high-resolution sequencing method. the method allowed microbial community analysis on all levels of microbial genomic guanine plus cytosine (g+c) content, including high g+c bacteria. methods: the collective faecal microbiota composition of ten ibs-d patients was analysed by examining sequences obtained using percent g+c (%g+c) -based profiling and fractioning combined with 16s rrna gene clone library sequencing of 3267 clones. the ibs-d library was compared with an analogous healthy-control library of 23 subjects. real-time pcr analysis was used to identify phylotypes belonging to the class gammaproteobacteria and the order coriobacteriales. results: significant differences were found between clone libraries of ibs-d patients and controls. the microbial communities of ibs-d patients were enriched in proteobacteria and firmicutes, but reduced in the number of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes compared to control. in particular, 16s rdna sequences belonging to the family lachnospiraceae within the phylum firmicutes were in greater abundance in the ibs-d clone library. conclusions: in the microbiota of ibs-d sufferers, notable differences were detected among the prominent bacterial phyla (firmicutes, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, and proteobacteria) localized within the gi tract.

TI  == exposure of different bacterial inocula to newborn chicken affects gut microbiota development and ileum gene expression.
AB  == the transition from a sterile gut environment to the development of microbiota in the newborns is not fully understood. the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of exposure to bacterial communities on the development of gut microbiota in the newly hatched chicken. a total of 90 as-hatched chicks were divided into three groups. groups a and b were treated with inocula of the cecal  origin, whereas group c was fed with sterile water. the major bacteria in inoculum-i to treat group a included bacteroides (20.7%), lachnospiraceae (17.2%) and unclassified ruminococcaceae (16.1%), whereas group b was introduced with inoculum-ii composed of prevotella (37.9%), acidaminococcus (16.1%) and dorea (12.6%). analyses of the ileal and cecal contents over a period of 15 days showed that inoculum-i resulted in a higher rate of colonization than inoculum-ii, but the colonization was predominantly in the cecum. the influence of inoculum-ii on  group b was similar to that of water on group c, showing only a marginal effect on colonization. microarray analysis showed that each group presented a distinct  pattern of gene expression in the ileum. in group a, the most obvious changes were noted in genes controlling the function of ion transport, cell cycle and chromosome maintenance, suggesting that the inocula influenced gene expression. our findings indicate that initial exposure to different bacterial communities could lead to the development of distinct microbiota and gene expression in the gut. it is possible to manipulate the gut microbiota by feeding to a proper bacterial composition at an early age.

TI  == diversity and population structure of sewage-derived microorganisms in wastewater treatment plant influent.
AB  == the release of untreated sewage introduces non-indigenous microbial populations of uncertain composition into surface waters. we used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing of hypervariable regions in rrna genes to profile microbial communities from eight untreated sewage influent samples of two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) in metropolitan milwaukee. the sewage profiles included  a discernible human faecal signature made up of several taxonomic groups including multiple bifidobacteriaceae, coriobacteriaceae, bacteroidaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae genera. the faecal signature made up a small  fraction of the taxa present in sewage but the relative abundance of these sequence tags mirrored the population structures of human faecal samples. these genera were much more prevalent in the sewage influent than standard indicators species. high-abundance sequences from taxonomic groups within the beta- and gammaproteobacteria dominated the sewage samples but occurred at very low levels  in faecal and surface water samples, suggesting that these organisms proliferate  within the sewer system. samples from jones island (ji--servicing residential plus a combined sewer system) and south shore (ss--servicing a residential area)  wwtps had very consistent community profiles, with greater similarity between wwtps on a given collection day than the same plant collected on different days.  rainfall increased influent flows at ss and ji wwtps, and this corresponded to greater diversity in the community at both plants. overall, the sewer system appears to be a defined environment with both infiltration of rainwater and stormwater inputs modulating community composition. microbial sewage communities  represent a combination of inputs from human faecal microbes and enrichment of specific microbes from the environment to form a unique population structure.

AB  == an obligate anaerobic, gram-staining-negative, mesophilic, cellulolytic bacterium, strain h1(t), was isolated from the rumen content of yak. cells were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.8-1.0 x 3.0-4.0 microm in size, non-motile and encapsulated with mucous materials. elliptical and terminal spores that swelled the cells were produced occasionally. the strain grew at 25-45 degrees c  (optimum, 38 degrees c) and ph 6.0-7.8 (optimum, ph 6.7). cellulose, cellobiose,  xylan, xylose and maltose were used as carbon and energy sources, but not glucose. products from cellulose and cellobiose fermentation were formic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide and trace amounts of ethanol, lactic acid and succinic acid. the genomic dna g+c content was 33.7+/-1.2 mol%. the predominant fatty acids were c(16 : 0) (27.1 %), c(14 : 0) (9.2 %) and iso-c( 16 : 0) (6.4%). based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, strain h1(t) was affiliated to the  clostridial rrna cluster xivb and showed the highest 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to clostridium lentocellum dsm 5427(t) (96.0 %). these two strains formed a distinct lineage of the family 'lachnospiraceae '. based on data from this polyphasic taxonomic study, a new genus, cellulosilyticum gen. nov., is proposed. cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is proposed for strain h1(t). the  type strain of cellulosilyticum ruminicola sp. nov. is strain h1(t) (=cgmcc 1.5065(t)=jcm 14822(t)). clostridium lentocellum was reclassified in the new genus as cellulosilyticum lentocellum comb. nov.

AB  == background: diet is an important factor in colorectal carcinogenesis; thus, dietary supplements may have a role in colorectal cancer prevention. objective: the objective was to establish the relative luminal, epithelial, and epigenetic consequences of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic dietary supplementation in humans. design: this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-wk crossover trial of resistant starch and bifidobacterium lactis, either alone or as a combined synbiotic preparation, in 20 human volunteers. rectal biopsy, feces, and serum samples were collected. the rectal mucosal endpoints were dna methylation at 16 cpg island loci and line-1, epithelial proliferation (ki67 immunohistochemistry), and crypt cellularity. the fecal endpoints were short-chain fatty acid concentrations, ph, ammonia, and microbiological profiles  (by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing). serum endpoints were a panel of cytokines and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein. results: seventeen  subjects completed the entire study. the synbiotic intervention fostered a significantly different fecal stream bacterial community than did either the prebiotic (p = 0.032) or the probiotic (p = 0.001) intervention alone, in part because of a greater proportion of patients harboring fecal lachnospiraceae spp.  these changes developed in the absence of any significant differences in fecal chemistry. there were no differences in epithelial kinetics. conclusions: this synbiotic supplementation with b. lactis and resistant starch, in the doses used, induced unique changes in fecal microflora but did not significantly alter any other fecal, serum, or epithelial variables. this trial was registered in the australian new zealand clinical trials registry at www.anzctr.org.au as actrn012606000115538.

TI  == evaluation of the bacterial diversity in the feces of cattle using 16s rdna bacterial tag-encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap).
AB  == background: the microbiota of an animal's intestinal tract plays important roles  in the animal's overall health, productivity and well-being. there is still a scarcity of information on the microbial diversity in the gut of livestock species such as cattle. the primary reason for this lack of data relates to the expense of methods needed to generate such data. here we have utilized a bacterial tag-encoded flx 16s rdna amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) approach that is able to perform diversity analyses of gastrointestinal populations. btefap is  relatively inexpensive in terms of both time and labor due to the implementation  of a novel tag priming method and an efficient bioinformatics pipeline. we have evaluated the microbiome from the feces of 20 commercial, lactating dairy cows. results: ubiquitous bacteria detected from the cattle feces included clostridium, bacteroides, porpyhyromonas, ruminococcus, alistipes, lachnospiraceae, prevotella, lachnospira, enterococcus, oscillospira, cytophage, anaerotruncus, and acidaminococcus spp. foodborne pathogenic bacteria were detected in several of the cattle, a total of 4 cows were found to be positive for salmonella spp (tentative enterica) and 6 cows were positive for campylobacter spp. (tentative lanienae). conclusion: using btefap we have examined the microbiota in the feces  of cattle. as these methods continue to mature we will better understand the ecology of the major populations of bacteria the lower intestinal tract. this in  turn will allow for a better understanding of ways in which the intestinal microbiome contributes to animal health, productivity and wellbeing.

TI  == eubacterium rangiferina, a novel usnic acid-resistant bacterium from the reindeer rumen.
AB  == reindeer are able to eat and utilize lichens as an important source of energy and nutrients. in the current study, the activities of antibiotic secondary metabolites including usnic, antranoric, fumarprotocetraric, and lobaric acid commonly found in lichens were tested against a collection of 26 anaerobic rumen  bacterial isolates from reindeer (rangifer tarandus tarandus) using the agar diffusion method. the isolates were identified based on their 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene sequences. usnic acid had a potent antimicrobial effect against 25 of the isolates, belonging to clostridiales, enterococci, and streptococci. isolates of clostridia and streptococci were also susceptible to atranoric and lobaric acid. however, one isolate (r3_91_1) was found to be resistant to usnic, antranoric, fumarprotocetraric, and lobaric acid. r3_91_1 was also seen invading and adhering to lichen particles when grown in a liquid anaerobic culture as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. this was a gram-negative, nonmotile rod (0.2-0.7 x 2.0-3.5 microm) with a deoxyribonucleic acid g + c content of 47.0 mol% and main cellular fatty acids including 15:0 anteiso-dimethyl acetal (dma), 16:0 iso-fatty acid methyl ester (fame), 13:0 iso-3oh fame, and 17:0 anteiso-fame, not matching any of the presently known profiles in the midi database. combined, the phenotypic and genotypic traits including the 16s rrna gene sequence show that r3_91_1 is a novel species inside  the order clostridiales within the family lachnospiraceae, for which we propose the name eubacterium rangiferina. this is the first record of a rumen bacterium able to tolerate and grow in the presence of usnic acid, indicating that the rumen microorganisms in these animals have adapted mechanisms to deal with lichen secondary metabolites, well known for their antimicrobial and toxic effects.

AB  == background: microorganisms appear to play important yet ill-defined roles in the  etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). this study utilized a novel population-based approach to identify bacteria and bacterial rrna genes associated with the development of colitis in il-10(-/-) mice. methods: mice were housed in 2 environments: a community mouse facility where the mice were fed nonsterile chow (room 3) and a limited access facility where the mice were fed sterile chow (room 4). every month the disease activity levels were assessed and  fecal bacterial compositions were analyzed. at the end of the experiments histological and bacterial analyses were performed on intestinal tissue. results: although disease activity increased over time in both environments, it progressed at a faster rate in room 3 than room 4. culture and culture-independent bacterial analyses identified several isolates and phylotypes associated with colitis. two  phylotypes (gpc2 and gp66) were distinguished by their negative associations with disease activity in fecal and tissue samples. notably, rrna genes from these phylotypes had high sequence identity (99%) to an rrna gene from a previously described flagellated clostridium (lachnospiraceae bacterium a4). conclusions: the negative associations of these 2 phylotypes (gpc2 and gp66) suggest that these bacteria were being immunologically targeted, consistent with prior findings that the lachnospiraceae bacterium a4 bears a prevalent flagellar antigen for disease-associated immunity in murine immune colitis and human crohn's disease. identification of these associations suggests that the experimental approach used in this study will have considerable utility in elucidating the host-microbe interactions underlying ibd.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == isolation of flagellated bacteria implicated in crohn's disease.
AB  == background: serologic expression cloning has identified flagellins of the intestinal microbiota as immunodominant antigens in experimental colitis in mice  and in individuals with crohn's disease (cd). the present study was done to identify the microbial source of such flagellins. methods: using a variety of isolation and culture approaches, a number of previously unknown flagellated bacteria were isolated. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequences, these bacteria fall into the family lachnospiraceae of the phylum firmicutes. results: serum igg from patients with cd and from mice with colitis reacted to the flagellins of these bacteria, and only their flagellins, whereas serum igg from controls did not. the sequence of these flagellins demonstrate conserved amino- and carboxy-terminal domains that cluster phylogenetically and have a predicted 3d structure similar to salmonella flic, including an intact tlr5 binding site. the flagellin of 1 of  these bacteria was likely o-glycosylated. conclusions: the conserved immune response in both mouse and human to these previously unknown flagellins of the microbiota indicate that they play an important role in host-microbe interactions in the intestine.

TI  == intestinal microbiota: a potential diet-responsive prevention target in apcmin mice.
AB  == we previously reported that two dietary regimens, calorie restriction (cr) and a  high olive oil-containing diet supplemented with a freeze-dried fruit and vegetable extract (ofv), reduced the development of intestinal adenomas in apc(min) mice by 57% and 33%, respectively, compared to control mice fed a defined diet ad libitum. the ofv diet was designed to have a strong effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota through its high content of fiber, which represents a major source of fermentable substrate for the gut bacteria. we hypothesized that some of the observed effects of diet on intestinal carcinogenesis might be mediated by diet-related changes in the bacterial species that thrive in the gut. therefore, we determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) how the dietary interventions affected the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and  we characterized specific microbiota changes that were associated with diet and reduced intestinal carcinogenesis. the ofv diet changed the overall composition of the intestinal microbiota, smaller changes were observed for the cr diet. furthermore, we detected a 16s rdna fragment associated with mice that did not develop polyps. sequence analysis suggested that hitherto unidentified bacteria belonging to the family lachnospiraceae (order clostridiales) were its source. thus, these bacteria may be an indicator of intestinal conditions associated with reduced intestinal carcinogenesis in apc(min) mice.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.

TI  == oribacterium sinus gen. nov., sp. nov., within the family 'lachnospiraceae' (phylum firmicutes).
AB  == a hitherto unknown anaerobic bacillus isolated from sinus pus in a young child (strain aip 354.02t) was characterized by using phenotypic and genotypic methods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that this strain was phylogenetically affiliated with several sequences of cloned 16s rrna gene inserts previously deposited in the public databases. according to their 16s rrna gene sequence similarities, these uncultivated bacteria, together with strain aip 354.02t, formed a separate subgroup belonging to the family 'lachnospiraceae' within the phylum firmicutes. oribacterium gen. nov. is proposed for this group of organisms and oribacterium sinus gen. nov. sp. nov. for strain aip 354.02t (= cip 107991t = ccug 48084t).

TI  == fermentation of glycolate by a pure culture of a strictly anaerobic gram-positive bacterium belonging to the family lachnospiraceae.
AB  == the component bacteria of a three-membered mixed culture able to ferment glycolate to acetate, propionate and co(2) were isolated in pure culture. all three strains were strict anaerobes that, on the basis of comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, belonged to the order clostridiales in the phylum firmicutes (low g+c gram-positive bacteria). two of the strains were not involved in glycolate metabolism. the third, the glycolate-fermenting strain 19gly4 (dsm 11261), was related to members of the family lachnospiraceae. the cells of strain 19gly4 were oval- to lemon-shaped, 0.85 microm long and 0.65 microm in diameter,  occurring singly, in pairs, or in chains of up to 30 cells. strain 19gly4 fermented glycolate or fumarate to acetate, succinate, and co(2). hydrogen was not formed, and strain 19gly4 was able to grow on glycolate in pure culture without any syntrophic hydrogen transfer and without the use of an external electron acceptor. there was no evidence for homoacetogenic metabolism. this bacterium therefore differs in metabolism from previously reported glycolate-utilising anaerobes.
