TI  == identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium deficient in crohn's disease.
AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss  of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. however, the chemical nature  of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined. methods: peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to f. prausnitzii supernatant. anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected  with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. in vivo, the cdna of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by  recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (dnbs)-colitis in mice. results: the seven peptides, identified in the f. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (mam), a protein of 15 kda, and comprising 53% of non-polar residues. this last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of mam-derived peptides. transfection of  mam cdna in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor (nf)-kappab pathway with a dose-dependent effect. finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding  mam was able to alleviate dnbs-induced colitis in mice. conclusions: a 15 kda protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by f. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in cd pathogenesis. this protein is able to inhibit  the nf-kappab pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.

TI  == the commensal bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii is protective in dnbs-induced chronic moderate and severe colitis models.
AB  == background: the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii, an abundant and representative bacterium of firmicutes phylum, has consistently been observed to  be lower in patients with crohn's disease than in healthy individuals. we have shown that both f. prausnitzii and its culture supernatant (sn) have anti-inflammatory and protective effects in a tnbs-induced acute colitis mouse model. here, we tested the effects of both f. prausnitzii and its sn in moderate  and severe dnbs-induced chronic colitis mouse models. methods: colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of dnbs. after either 4 or 10 days of recovery (severe and moderate protocols, respectively), groups of mice were intragastrically administered either with f. prausnitzii a2-165 or with its culture sn for 7 or 10 days. three days before being sacrificed, colitis was reactivated by administration of a lower dose of dnbs. the severity of colitis at the time of being sacrificed was assessed by weight loss and macroscopic and microscopic scores. myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, cytokine levels, lymphocyte populations, and changes in microbiota were studied. results: intragastric administration of either f. prausnitzii or its sn led to a significant decrease in colitis severity in both severe and moderate chronic colitis models. the lower severity of colitis was associated with down-regulation of mpo, pro-inflammatory  cytokines, and t-cell levels. conclusions: we show, for the first time, protective effects of both f. prausnitzii and its sn during both the period of recovery from chronic colitis and colitis reactivation. these results provide further evidence that f. prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory bacterium with therapeutic potential for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
