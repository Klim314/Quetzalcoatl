inhibition of bacillus cereus strains by antimicrobial metabolites from lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21.
bacillus cereus is an endospore-forming, gram-positive bacterium able to cause foodborne diseases. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are known for their ability to synthesize organic acids and bacteriocins, but the potential of these compounds against b. cereus has been scarcely documented in food models. the present study has examined the effect of the metabolites produced by lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21 on the viability of select b. cereus strains. furthermore, the effect of e. faecium sm21 metabolites against b. cereus strains has also been investigated on a rice food model. l. johnsonii crl1647 produced 128 mmol/l of lactic acid, 38 mmol/l of acetic acid and 0.3 mmol/l of phenyl-lactic acid. these organic acids reduced the number of vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains tested. however, the antagonistic effect disappeared at ph 6.5. on the other hand, e. faecium sm21 produced only lactic and acetic acid (24.5 and 12.2 mmol/l, respectively) and was able to inhibit both vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains, at a final fermentation ph of 5.0 and at ph 6.5. this would indicate the action of other metabolites, different from organic acids, present in the cell-free supernatant. on cooked rice grains, the e. faecium sm21 bacteriocin(s) were tested against two b. cereus strains. both of them were significantly affected within the first 4 h of contact; whereas b. cereus bac1 cells recovered after 24 h, the effect on b. cereus 1 remained up to the end of the assay. the lab studied may thus be considered to define future strategies for biological control of b. cereus.
production, characterization, and antimicrobial activity of a bacteriocin from newly isolated enterococcus faecium ij-31.
this work aimed to isolate and characterize enterococcus spp. from indigenous dairy products in islamabad, pakistan. by classical microbiological techniques, one strain from a butter sample was identified to be enterococcus faecium, and we designated it e. faecium ij-31. the precise identity of this strain was then established by determining the sequence of its 16s and 23s rrna genes. the sequence homology searches revealed matches with a number of previously reported strains, such as e. faecium hn-n3 and hn-n29, both isolated from swine intestines in china. the newly isolated strain was tested for hemolysis and antibiotic sensitivity; it was nonhemolytic on sheep and human blood and sensitive to vancomycin. consistent with its vancomycin sensitivity, repeated attempts to amplify the vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb failed. similar attempts to amplify the virulence genes gele, agg, and cyl also failed, suggesting the absence of these genes. in contrast, the enterocin-p gene, entp, readily amplified with primers based on the previously reported sequences, and the deduced sequence showed near identity with a number of reported sequences from e. faecium. further, the 71-residue enterocin-p sequence from strain ij-31 is only the second complete sequence reported. the enterocin was partially purified and tested for antibacterial activity. it showed potent inhibitory activity against many bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, a routinely used test strain. further, the enterocin showed potent activity against bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus. the enterocin retained antibacterial activity even following heating to 121 degrees celsius for 15 min. further, it also retained activity after exposure to ph values ranging from 4 to 10. however, proteinase k treatment rendered the peptide nonfunctional.
antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium fair-e 198 inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 au ml(-1)). however, none of the b. cereus and s. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. the maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 au ml(-1)) was observed in mrs broth, while the activity in milk was 100 au ml(-1). in the co-cultivation test in milk, b. cereus k1-b041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log cfu ml(-1)) after 48 h. e. faecium reduced the initial l. monocytogenes scott a population by 1 log cfu ml(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees c, however, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. e. faecium did not influence the growth of s. aureus atcc 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium fair-e 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
