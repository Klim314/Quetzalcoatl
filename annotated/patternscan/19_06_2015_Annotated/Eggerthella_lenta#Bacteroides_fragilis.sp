TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
