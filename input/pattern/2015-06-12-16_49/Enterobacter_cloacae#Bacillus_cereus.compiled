TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).

CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it seems that Z. multiflora and M. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Identification of cultivable bacteria in the intestinal tract of Bactrocera dorsalis from three different populations and determination of their attractive potential.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the cultivable bacteria inhabiting the intestinal tract of adult oriental fruit flies (Bactrocera dorsalis) from laboratory-reared, laboratory sterile sugar-reared, and field-collected populations, and to evaluate the attractiveness of the metabolites produced by the above bacteria to their hosts. RESULTS: Fifteen bacterial isolates chosen from the three populations were determined at species level. These 15 strains were cultured and the attractiveness of the whole Luria-Bertani broth, filtered and autoclaved supernatants to B. dorsalis adults was determined using bioassays. The bioassays showed that all bacterial strains were significantly more attractive to B. dorsalis adults than the media-only control. Among them, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were the most attractive bacteria. Furthermore, results of a subsequent field test showed that the six bacterial strains were significantly more attractive than the control, with B. cereus and E. faecalis attracting significantly more flies. CONCLUSIONS: A cultivable bacterial community composed of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Bacillaceae was identified in the intestinal tract of B. dorsalis. Metabolites from B. cereus attracted the greatest number of B. dorsalis adults in the laboratory and field. These results provide useful information for the development of bacterial biocontrol agents or implementation as an insecticide.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Essential oil of Mitracarpus frigidus as a potent source of bioactive compounds.
AB  - In our previous work (Fabri et al. 2009), we showed that different extracts of Mitracarpus frigidus had significant antibacterial, antifungal and leishmanicidal activities. In order to increase our knowledge about this species, this work assesses the chemical composition and the in vitro biological activity of its essential oil. Thus, the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of M. frigidus was analyzed by GC/MS. Among several compounds detected, 11 were identified, being linalool and eugenol acetate the major components. The essential oil exhibited a moderate antibacterial effect against Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 250 microg/mL). On the other hand, it showed a strong antifungal effect against Cryptoccocus neoformans (MIC 8 microg/mL) and Candida albicans (MIC 63 microg/mL). Expressive activity against L. major and L. amazonensis promastigote forms with IC50 values of 47.2 and 89.7 microg/mL, respectively, were also observed. In addition, the antioxidant activity was investigated through DPPH radical-scavenging and showed a significative activity with IC50 of 38 microg/mL. The cytotoxicity against Artemia salina was moderate with LC(50) of 88 microg/mL. The results presented here are the first report on the chemical composition and biological properties of M. frigidus essential oil.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles as functional antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The ability for silver nanoparticles to function as an antibacterial agent while  being separable from the target fluids is important for bacterial inactivation in biological fluids. This report describes the analysis of the antimicrobial activities of silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical methods. The bacterial inactivation of several types of bacteria was analyzed, including Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter cloacae , and Escherichia coli ). The results have demonstrated the viability of the silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles for achieving effective bacterial inactivation efficiency comparable to and better than that of silver nanoparticles conventionally used. The bacteria inactivation efficiency of our silver-coated MnZn ferrite (MZF@Ag) nanoparticles was also determined for blood platelets samples, demonstrating the potential of utilization in inactivating bacterial growth in platelets prior to transfusion to ensure blood product safety, which also has important implications for enabling the capability of effective separation, delivery, and targeting of the antibacterial agents.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Blumea balsamifera (Lin.) DC. extracts and essential oil.
AB  - Leaves of Blumea balsamifera (Lin.) DC. are used in traditional Thai and Chinese  medicine for the treatment of septic wounds and other infections. In this study, the essential oil, hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of these leaves were evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities using the disc diffusion assay and agar microdilution method. The essential oil was the most potent, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 microg mL(-)(1) against Bacillus cereus and an MIC of 1.2 mg mL(-)(1) against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Activity was also detected from the hexane extract against Enterobacter cloacae and S. aureus. Minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations were typically equal to or two-fold higher than the MICs for both extracts, indicating microbicidal activity. The present data show that B. balsamifera extracts have activity against various infectious and toxin-producing microorganisms. This plant's active constituents could potentially be developed for use in the treatment and/or prevention of microbial disease.
TI  - Differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  - Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075 (serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the bacteria investigated down to the species level.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 in fermented crop straw. METHODS: Total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. All these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of SFC-2. RESULTS: (1) Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacterfreundii, Klebsiella terrigena and Citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) Indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of SFC-2 cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that: SFC-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from SFC-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) Antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from the culture of SFC-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease K.
TI  - Digestion of rice straw and oil palm fronds by microflora from rumen and termite  bacteria, in vitro.
AB  - The digestion and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) production from rice straw and oil palm fronds by cellulolytic bacteria isolated from the termite Coptotermes curvignathus were investigated. The bacteria were Acinetobacter strain Raminalimon, Enterobacter aerogenes strain Razmin C, Enterobacter cloacae strain Razmin B, Bacillus cereus strain Razmin A and Chryseobacterium kwangyangense strain Cb. Acinetobacter strain Raminalimon is an aerobic bacterium, while the other species are facultative anaerobes. There were significant differences (p<0.05) among the bacteria for Dry Matter (DM) lost and acetic acid production from rice straw and Acinetobacter strain Raminalimon showed the highest activity. The facultative bacteria C. kwangyangense strain Cb (cfu mL(-1) 231 x 10(-6), OD: 0.5), E. cloacae (cfu mL(-1) 68 x 10(-7), OD: 0.5) and E. aerogenes (cfu mL(-1) 33 x 10(-7), OD: 0.5) were used for digestion study with the rumen fluid microflora. The in vitro gas production technique was applied for the comparative study and the parameters measured were pH, gas (volume), dry matter lost, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid concentrations. pH was not significantly (p<0.05) different among the five treatments. The bacterium C. kwangyangense strain Cb showed the highest activity (p<0.05) for DM lost, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid production from rice straw when compared to the other bacterial activities. There was no significance (p<0.05) difference between the three bacteria for the dry matter lost of oil palm fronds but the production of Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA) was significantly (p<0.05) high in the treatment which was inoculated with C. kwangyangense strain Cb. The Gen Bank NCBI/EMBL accession numbers for the bacterial strains are EU332791, EU305608, EU305609, EU294508 and EU169201.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - [Microbiological monitoring of milk samples and surface samples in a hospital infant formula room].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Analyze the microbiological quality of reconstituted milk formulas and the surface hygiene in a hospital infant formula room, in the context of a worldwide emergence of Enterobacter sakazakii infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over 3.5 years, monthly samples of reconstituted milk formulas as well as quarterly infant formula room surface samples were taken for bacteriological analysis. RESULTS: Of the 156 formulas analyzed, 54 carried microorganisms but no pathogenic bacteria. The presence of Bacillus species was found in 54% of the formulas for premature infants and in 19% of the other formulas (significant difference). Bacteria, probably brought by operators during reconstitution of the powdered formulas, were found in four of 156 samples (two negative-coagulase staphylococcus, one alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and one Clostridium bifermentans). Surfaces were studied using 117 samples divided into 11 series: 4.3% of the points carried pathogenic bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bulhkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus). DISCUSSION: The presence of Bacillus species should be analyzed thoroughly so as to differentiate Bacillus cereus from other nonpathogenic species. The microbiological analysis techniques used for reconstituted infant formulas can be simplified. CONCLUSION: The quality of the infant formulas seems satisfactory. Hygiene practices provide good microbiological quality in reconstituted infant milk formulas. Microbiological monitoring of these preparations and the infant formula room surfaces is an important aspect of the quality assurance policy, which makes it possible to take corrective measures when an unsatisfactory result is found.
TI  - Detection, isolation, and identification of cadmium-resistant bacteria based on PCR-DGGE.
AB  - This study focused on the screening of cadmium-resistant bacterial strains from Pb-Zn tailing. We investigated the diversity of microbial community inhabiting Dong-san-cha Pb-Zn tailing in Beijing, China, by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene of bacterial strain, and found two dominant strains in the DGGE profile. Using special culture media, we isolated two strong cadmium-resistant bacterial strains. On the basis of morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, BIOLOG, and 16S rDNA sequencing, the two strains were identified as Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter cloacae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of heavy metals for the bacteria were determined. E. cloacae showed higher MIC values for heavy metals and a larger range of antibiotic resistance than B. cereus.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Control of microorganisms and reduction of biogenic amines in chicken breast and  thigh by irradiation and organic acids.
AB  - The effect of irradiation or organic acid treatment of raw chicken breast and thigh meat to control inoculated microorganisms and the production of biogenic amines (BA) was studied. Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Alcaligenes faecalis were selected and inoculated into raw ground chicken breast and thigh meat at approximately 10(7) cfu/g. The samples were irradiated at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 kGy or mixed with a 0.2 M solution of acetic, citric, or lactic acid (1 mL for 10 g of meat sample) for 24 h at 4 degrees C. Viable cell counts and BA contents were determined. Irradiation was effective in reducing the inoculated bacteria: 0.5 kGy achieved approximately a 2-log reduction, and no viable cells were detected at a dose of 2 kGy. In contrast, only up to a 1-log reduction was achieved by organic acid treatment except for citric acid, which achieved approximately a 3-log reduction of E. cloacae. Both the irradiation and organic acid treatment of raw chicken breast and thigh reduced the BA content, but the rate of BA reduction differed by inoculated organism and treatment (irradiation or organic acid). Although irradiation was an excellent method for controlling inoculated microorganisms, the content of BA produced was similar to that of the organic acid treatment of raw chicken breast and thigh meat.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant for high-throughput screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The increasing emergence of new bacterial beta-lactamases that can efficiently hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics to clinically inactive carboxylic acids has created an intractable problem in the treatment of bacterial infections, and it is highly desirable to develop a useful tool that can rapidly screen bacteria for beta-lactamases against a variety of antibiotic candidates in a high-throughput manner. This paper describes the use of a fluorescein-labeled beta-lactamase mutant (E166Cf) as a convenient fluorescent tool to screen beta-lactamases, including the Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I (PenPC), B. cereus beta-lactamase II, Bacillus licheniformis PenP, Escherichia coli TEM-1, and Enterobacter cloacae P99 against various beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam, cephaloridine), using a 96-well microplate reader. The E166Cf mutant was constructed by replacing Glu166 on the flexible Omega-loop, which is close to the enzyme's active site, with a cysteine residue on a class A beta-lactamase (B. cereus PenPC) and subsequently labeling the mutant with thiol-reactive fluorescein-5-maleimide. Such modifications significantly impaired the hydrolytic activity of the E166Cf mutant compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. The fluorescence intensity of the E166Cf mutant increases in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. For antibiotics that are resistant to hydrolysis by the E166Cf mutant (cefuroxime, cefoxitin, moxalactam), the fluorescence signal slowly increases until it reaches a plateau. For antibiotics that can be slowly hydrolyzed by the E166Cf mutant (penicillin G, penicillin V, ampicillin), the fluorescence signal rapidly increases to the plateau and then declines after a prolonged incubation. The E166Cf mutant retains its characteristic pattern of fluorescence signals in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. In contrast, in the presence of both bacterial beta-lactamases and beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics, the fluorescence signals of the E166Cf mutant were decreased. The fluorescence signals from the E166Cf mutant allow an unambiguous differentiation of beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics from beta-lactamase-sensitive ones in the screening of bacterial beta-lactamases against a panel of antibiotic candidates. This simple method may provide an alternative tool in choosing potent beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamase generated from beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The resistance of bacteria to the normally lethal action of beta-lactam antibiotics is largely due to the production of beta-lactamases that catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam. One class of these enzymes is a zinc-dependent metallo-beta-lactamase for which there are no clinically available inhibitors. The hydrolysis of cephalosporin beta-lactam antibiotics generates dihydrothiazines which subsequently undergo isomerization at C6 by C-S bond cleavage and through the intermediacy of a thiol. These thiols can be trapped by the beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus, causing inhibition of the enzyme. The rate of production of the thiol corresponds to the rate of inhibition, and the inhibition constants are in the micromolar range but vary with the nature of the cephalosporin derivative. NMR studies have identified the structure of the thiols causing inhibition and also show that the thiol binds to the zinc ion, which in turn perturbs the metal-bound histidines. Inhibition is slowly removed as the thiol becomes oxidized or undergoes further degradation. The thiol intermediate generated from cephalothin is a slow binding inhibitor. There is no observed inhibition from the analogous degradation products from penicillins.
TI  - Practical application of dynamic temperature profiles to estimate the parameters  of the square root model.
AB  - Optimal experimental design for parameter estimation (OED/PE) is a promising method to improve parameter estimation accuracy and minimise experimental effort in the field of predictive microbiology. In this paper, the OED/PE methodology was applied on two practical examples: the growth of Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter cloacae in liquid whole egg product. Both strains were recovered from samples of a commercial product. The goal of the modelling exercise was to quantify the influence of temperature on bacterial growth. The Baranyi-model for bacterial growth combined with the Ratkowsky square root model to describe temperature dependence was used. Using this model, a temperature step profile was calculated based on the optimal D-criterion. The model was then fitted against the experimental bacterial growth curve measured under the dynamic temperature conditions. This process was repeated until the parameters could be estimated with sufficient accuracy, apparent by the model prediction errors. For B. cereus, prior information could be extracted from the literature, allowing calculating a dynamic temperature profile directly. Two-step profiles were sufficient to obtain a good estimation for the model parameters. No prior information could be found for E. cloacae. Therefore, a limited series of static experiments had to be conducted to obtain usable prior model parameters estimates. Only one dynamic experiment was then needed to achieve a good estimation.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - Diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with Xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  - Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all Citrus sinensis cultivars. The endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and CVC-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. The endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as Bacillus pumilus, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium spp. (including Methylobacterium extorquens, M. fujisawaense, M. mesophilicum, M. radiotolerans, and M. zatmanii), Nocardia sp., Pantoea agglomerans, and Xanthomonas campestris. We observed a relationship between CVC symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of Methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. In contrast, we isolated C. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of CVC while P. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (Citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (C. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of CVC. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total plant DNA resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that DGGE profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. However, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. A specific band with a high G+C ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. The higher frequency of C. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to CVC.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Kinetic study of two novel enantiomeric tricyclic beta-lactams which efficiently  inactivate class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - A detailed kinetic study of the interaction between two ethylidene derivatives of tricyclic carbapenems, Lek 156 and Lek 157, and representative beta-lactamases and D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidases (DD-peptidases) is presented. Both compounds are very efficient inactivators of the Enterobacter cloacae 908R beta-lactamase, which is usually resistant to inhibition. Preliminary experiments indicate that various extended-spectrum class C beta-lactamases (ACT-1, CMY-1, and MIR-1) are also inactivated. With the E. cloacae 908R enzyme, complete inactivation occurs with a second-order rate constant, k(2)/K', of 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), and reactivation is very slow, with a half-life of >1 h. Accordingly, Lek 157 significantly decreases the MIC of ampicillin for E. cloacae P99, a constitutive class C beta-lactamase overproducer. With the other serine beta-lactamases tested, the covalent adducts exhibit a wide range of stabilities, with half-lives ranging from long (>4 h with the TEM-1 class A enzyme), to medium (10 to 20 min with the OXA-10 class D enzyme), to short (0.2 to 0.4 s with the NmcA class A beta-lactamase). By contrast, both carbapenems behave as good substrates of the Bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamase (class B). The Streptomyces sp. strain R61 and K15 extracellular DD-peptidases exhibit low levels of sensitivity to both compounds.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  - Fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. The principal bacterial species isolated were Alcaligenes sp., Bacillus spp. (including B. cereus, B. lentus, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis), Burkholderia cepacia, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium extorquens, and Pantoea agglomerans, with P. agglomerans and B. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. The most abundant fungal species were Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Guignardia citricarpa, and Cladosporium sp. Genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, which indicated that B. pumilus isolates were more diverse than P. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. In vitro interaction studies between G. citricarpa isolates and the most frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by G. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some Bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on P. agglomerans.
TI  - Isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae).
AB  - From the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, Micrococcaceae, Deinococcacea, Bacillaceae, and the genus Listeria. Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with Citrobacter, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, and Listeria found less frequently. We found Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. We also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, E. sakazakii, K. pneumoniae spp., Providencia rettgeri, P. aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. Isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). Antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units: prospective study].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet concentrates contaminated with bacteria are a main source of transfusion-associated sepsis. Several studies have reported a very wide incidence (0-10%) of contamination. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units at the regional blood transfusion center in Casablanca. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During 15.5 months, 3,458 platelet concentrates (PCs) were analysed. The plasma from the bag and the tube was homogenised. One-fifth of the tube contents were inoculated every day for five days in two tubes containing 2.5 mL of Tryptic soy broth. One tube was incubated at room temperature and the other at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The bacteria were identified by standard procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-five (0.72%) of 3,458 platelet bags were contaminated. Twenty-two bacteria (88%) were found in the platelet bags stored three days or more, of which 14 (56%) were Staphylococci coagulase negative, two Staphylococcus aureus, one alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus, four bacillus cereus, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Escherichia Coli and two Xanthomonas maltophilia. CONCLUSION: The incidence reported in this series is higher than that reported by most authors.
TI  - Carbapenem derivatives as potential inhibitors of various beta-lactamases, including class B metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  - A variety of 1beta-methylcarbapenem derivatives were screened to identify inhibitors of IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase, a class B beta-lactamase, in an automated microassay system using nitrocefin as a substrate. The structure-inhibitory-activity relationship study revealed that three types of 1beta-methylcarbapenems having benzothienylthio, dithiocarbamate, or pyrrolidinylthio moieties at the C-2 position showed good inhibitory activity. Among the compounds screened, J-110,441, having a benzothienylthio moiety at the C-2 position of 1beta-methylcarbapenem, was the most potent inhibitor of class B metallo-beta-lactamases with K(i) values of 0. 0037, 0.23, 1.00, and 0.83 microM for IMP-1 encoded by the bla(IMP) gene, CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis, L1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and type II from Bacillus cereus, respectively. In a further characterization study, J-110,441 also showed inhibitory activity against TEM-type class A serine beta-lactamase and chromosomal class C serine beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae with K(i) values of 2.54 and 0.037 microM, respectively. Combining imipenem or ceftazidime with J-110,441 had a synergistic effect on the antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Against the isolates of IMP-1-producing Serratia marcescens, the MICs of imipenem decreased to levels ranging from 1/64 to 1/4 in the presence of one-fourth of the MIC of J-110,441. Against E. cloacae producing high levels of class C beta-lactamase, the MIC of ceftazidime decreased from 64 to 4 microg/ml in the presence of 4 microg of J-110,441 per ml. This is the first report to describe a new class of inhibitor of class B and class C beta-lactamases including transferable IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamases.
TI  - Acquired carbapenemases.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - [The anticomplement activity of the commercial strain of Bacillus cereus IP 5832  and of enterobacteria when cocultured].
AB  - Bacillus cereus production strain IP 5832 of the preparation "Bactisubtil" has been characterized with respect to its anticomplementary activity (ACA) and the parameters of its heterogeneity in the process of adaptation to trypticase-soybean medium and during cultivation in anaerobic conditions have been determined. The cultivation of B.cereus strain IP 5832 jointly with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated in enteric disbiosis, affects ACA in different ways, which leads to structural changes in the populations of these enterobacteria, characterized by an increase of their heterogeneity with respect to ACA.
TI  - Beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects on beta-lactamase catalysis.
AB  - Beta-Secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the steady-state kinetic parameters V/K and V for turnover of a depsipeptide substrate, m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]-oxy]benzoic acid, and of a beta-lactam substrate, penicillanic acid, by three typical class A beta-lactamases and a class C beta-lactamase. The isotope effects on alkaline hydrolysis of these substrates have been used as a frame of reference. The effect of the transition state conformation of the substrates in determining the beta-secondary isotope effects has been explicitly considered. The inverse beta-secondary isotope effects on both V/K and V for the class A enzymes with both substrates indicate transition states where the carbonyl group of the scissile bond has become tetrahedral and therefore reflect typical acyl-transfer transition states. The solvent isotope effects indicate that enzyme deacylation (as reflected in V for the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase) may be a classical general-base-catalyzed hydrolysis but that there is little proton motion in the enzyme acylation transition state (as revealed by V/K) for the TEM beta-lactamase and Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I. These results provide kinetic support for the conjecture made on structural grounds that class A beta-lactamases employ an asymmetric double-displacement mechanism. The isotope effects on V/K for the class C beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 suggest an acyl-transfer transition state for the penicillin, although, as for the class A enzymes, without significant proton motion. On the other hand, the V/K transition state for depsipeptide does not seem to involve covalent chemistry. Suggestive of this conclusion are the measured beta-secondary isotope effect of 1,002 +/- 0.012 and the inverse solvent isotope effect. These results provide an example of a significant difference between the kinetics of turnover of a beta-lactam and a depsipeptide by a beta-lactamase. The V transition state for both substrates with the P99 beta-lactamase probably involves acyl-transfer (deacylation) where the conformation of the acyl-enzyme is closely restricted. The conformations of acyl-enzymes of the PC1 and P99 beta-lactamases correlate to the (different) dispositions of general base catalysts at their active sites.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum aureonitens (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts from Helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. The dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus and Micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Cephalosporin derivatives of doxorubicin as prodrugs for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  - The synthesis of a series of cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives that differ with respect to the substituent at position 7 of the cephem nucleus is described. These compounds are designed as prodrugs of doxorubicin for activation by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates. The key step in the synthesis of this series of compounds involves the use of the phenylacetamido group as an enzymatically removable protecting group for the 7-amino group on the cephem. In vitro cytotoxicity assays with H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells revealed that cephalosporin doxorubicin derivatives were all less toxic than the released drug. Prodrugs containing negatively charged groups in the side chain, such as the delta-carboxybutanamido derivative 4 and the alpha-sulfophenylacetyl derivative 5, displayed the least cytotoxic activity and were 46- and 26-fold less toxic than doxorubicin, respectively. The efficiency of activation of all the prodrugs was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays on H2981 cells with the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae P99, Escherichia coli TEM-1, and Bacillus cereus (type II). In general, the E. cloacae enzyme was found to most rapidly activate the majority of these prodrugs. Phenylacetamido prodrug 2 and delta-carboxybutanamido prodrug 4 were both activated in an immunospecific manner by L6-E. cloacae beta-lactamase, a monoclonal antibody conjugate that binds to receptors on H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells.
TI  - Kinetic and physical studies of beta-lactamase inhibition by a novel penem, BRL 42715.
AB  - The interactions of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus I, TEM, Klebsiella pneumoniae K1 and Enterobacter cloacae P99 beta-lactamases with the novel penem inhibitor BRL 42715 were investigated kinetically and, in some cases, by electrospray mass spectrometry (e.s.m.s.). All the beta-lactamases were rapidly inactivated by BRL 42715, with second-order rate constants ranging from 0.17 to 6.4 microM-1.s-1. The initial stoichiometry of beta-lactamase inhibition was essentially 1:1, with the exception of the K1 enzyme. In this instance about 20 molecules of BRL 42715 were hydrolysed before the enzyme was completely inhibited. Inhibited beta-lactamases did not readily regain activity in the absence of BRL 42715, the half-lives for regeneration of free enzyme ranging from 5 min for the K1 beta-lactamase to over 2 days for the staphylococcal enzyme. Recovery of activity was incomplete for TEM-1, K1 and P99 beta-lactamases, suggesting partitioning of the inhibited enzymes to give a permanently (or at least very stable) inactivated species. Examination of the interactions of the penem with TEM, B. cereus I and P99 beta-lactamases by e.s.m.s. also showed rapid and stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor. In all cases a mass increase of 264 Da over the native enzyme was observed, corresponding to the molecular mass of BRL 42715, showing that no fragmentation of the penem occurred on reaction with the beta-lactamases.
TI  - Antitumor activities of a cephalosporin prodrug in combination with monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates.
AB  - 7-(Phenylacetamido)cephalosporin mustard (CM) and 7-(4-carboxybutanamido)cephalosporin mustard (CCM) were developed as anticancer prodrugs that could be activated site selectively by monoclonal antibody-beta-lactamase conjugates targeted to antigens present on tumor cell surfaces. Both CM and CCM were hydrolyzed by purified beta-lactamases from Escherichia coli (EC beta L), Bacillus cereus (BC beta L), and Enterobacter cloacae (ECl beta L). This resulted in the release of phenylenediamine mustard (PDM), a potent cytotoxic drug. The Km and kcat values of the reactions were determined, and it was found that ECl beta L effected the hydrolysis of CM and CCM more rapidly than the other enzymes. Conjugates of ECl beta L were prepared by reacting maleimide-substituted F(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies L6 and P1.17 to ECl beta L that had been modified with sulfhydryl groups. In vitro experiments indicated that CCM (IC50 = 25-45 microM) was less toxic than PDM (IC50 = 1.5 microM) to H2981 lung adenocarcinoma cells (L6 antigen positive, P1.17 antigen negative) and that immunologically specific prodrug activation took place when the cells were treated with L6-ECl beta L. In vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that CCM was less toxic than CM, and that both prodrugs were much less toxic than PDM. Neither CCM nor PDM exerted antitumor activity on subcutaneous H2981 tumors in vivo. However, a significant antitumor effect was obtained in mice that received L6-ECl beta L 96 h prior to the administration of CCM. The effect was immunologically specific (P < 0.05), since a smaller degree of antitumor activity was obtained in mice that received the nonbinding control conjugate P1.17-ECl beta L prior to CCM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Biochemical properties of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae and cloning of the gene into Escherichia coli.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae, strain NOR-1, exhibited resistance to imipenem and remained susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Clavulanic acid partially restored the susceptibility of the strain to imipenem. Two beta-lactamases with isoelectric points (pI) of 6.9 and > 9.2 were detected in strain E. cloacae NOR-1; the higher pI corresponded to AmpC cephalosporinase. Plasmid DNA was not detected in E. cloacae NOR-1 and imipenem resistance could not be transferred into Escherichia coli JM109. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene was cloned into plasmid pACYC184. One recombinant plasmid, pPTN1, harbored a 5.3-kb Sau3A fragment from E. cloacae NOR-1 expressing the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase. This enzyme (pI 6.9) hydrolyzed ampicillin, cephalothin, and imipenem more rapidly than it did meropenem and aztreonam, but it hydrolyzed extended-spectrum cephalosporins only weakly and did not hydrolyze cefoxitin. Hydrolytic activity was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, was nonsusceptible to chelating agents such as EDTA and 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and was independent of the presence of ZnCl2. Its relative molecular mass was 30,000 Da. Induction experiments concluded that the carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase biosynthesis was inducible by cefoxitin and imipenem. Subcloning experiments with HindIII partial digests of pPTN1 resulted in a recombinant plasmid, designated pPTN2, which contained a 1.3-kb insert from pPTN1 and which conferred resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Hybridization studies performed with a 1.2-kb HindIII fragment from pPtN2 failed to determine any homology with ampC of E. cloacae, with other known beta-lactamase genes commonly found in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (bla(TEM-1)) and bla(SHV-3) derivatives), and with previously described carbapenemase genes such as those from Xanthomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis (cfiA), and Aeromonas hydrophila (cphA). This work describing the biochemical properties of a novel chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase from E. cloacae indicates that this enzyme differs from all the previously described carbapenemases. This is the first reported cloning of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing gene from a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from Streptomyces clavuligerus and cloning and analysis of the corresponding gene.
AB  - Culture filtrates of Streptomyces clavuligerus contain a proteinaceous beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLIP) in addition to a variety of beta-lactam compounds. BLIP was first detected by its ability to inhibit Bactopenase, a penicillinase derived from Bacillus cereus, but it has also been shown to inhibit the plasmid pUC- and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of Escherichia coli. BLIP showed no inhibitory effect against Enterobacter cloacae beta-lactamase, and it also showed no activity against an alternative source of B. cereus penicillinase. BLIP was purified to homogeneity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a size estimate for BLIP of 16,900 to 18,000. The interaction between purified BLIP and the E. coli(pUC) beta-lactamase was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determined to be noncovalent, with an estimated 1:1 molar stoichiometry. The BLIP gene was isolated on a 13.5-kilobase fragment of S. clavuligerus chromosomal DNA which did not overlap a 40-kilobase region of DNA known to contain genes for beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis. The gene encoded a mature protein with a deduced amino acid sequence of 165 residues (calculated molecular weight of 17,523) and also encoded a 36-amino-acid signal sequence. No significant sequence similarity to BLIP was found by pairwise comparisons using various protein and nucleotide sequence data banks or by hybridization experiments, and no BLIP activity was detected in the culture supernatants of other Streptomyces spp.
TI  - Beta-lactamase evaluation of the amoxycillin-clavulanate association.
AB  - The capability of potassium clavulanate to protect amoxycillin from destruction by three partially purified beta-lactamases (from E. cloacae, B. cereus 569/H9 and E. coli R-TEM) was evaluated. The enzymatic inhibition was determined spectrophotometrically by assessing the ability of either amoxycillin or potassium clavulanate or their combination (at a 7:1 ratio by weight) to prevent the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate (nitrocefin) after different pre-incubation times, thus determining the IC50 and Ki values. Potassium clavulanate significantly reduced the IC50 values of amoxycillin for B. cereus and TEM enzymes by a factor ranging from 500 to 1200, by inhibiting these beta-lactamases at concentrations ranging from 4 to 0.008 microM. However, clavulanic acid was quite ineffective against type I enzymes (from E. cloacae), while amoxycillin was found to be sufficiently stable (IC50 of 0.8-1.4 microM).
TI  - On the kinetic interaction between ceftriaxone and some beta-lactamases.
AB  - The activity of beta-lactamases from Citrobacter diversus ULA-27 on ceftriaxone,  a widely recognized third-generation cephalosporin, has been examined and compared to the activity of various other beta-lactamases from different sources. Ceftriaxone (Roche S.p.A. Milan) was found to be resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus cereus, but susceptible to beta-lactamases from Mycobacterium fortuitum strain Cow 18 and, mostly, to beta-lactamases from various strains of Citrobacter diversus. Derivatives with substituents in the 3-position of ceftriaxone, namely cefotaxime (Roussel Maestretti S.p.A., Milan) and ceftizoxime (Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan), were much less susceptible to hydrolysis by C. diversus ULA-27 enzymes (22 and 6% of ceftriaxone hydrolysis, respectively), the hydrolysis rate being paralleled by differences in MIC values. Ceftriaxone inhibited the activity of E. cloacae beta-lactamases toward cefazolin as substrate, but the inhibition was totally abolished by preincubation of ceftriaxone with the enzyme before addition of the substrate. Overall, the data point to a relevance of C. diversus ULA-27 beta-lactamases in the mechanism of resistance of this strain to the various third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Cryoenzymology of beta-lactamases.
AB  - The cryoenzymology of several different beta-lactamases has been investigated. Particular attention has been paid to the experimental pitfalls of the technique. These include such factors as false bursts at the start of the reaction, instability of the enzymes during turnover, and Km values so high that little of the enzyme is present as a complex. Many of the difficulties in cryoenzymology stem from the use of organic cryosolvents. A novel "salt" cryosolvent has been tested: ammonium acetate solutions can be used down to about -60 degrees C. The enzymes examined are readily soluble, and stable, in this solvent. Nevertheless, out of 17 beta-lactamase beta-lactam systems, only 4 proved suitable for detailed investigation. In two of these, the hydrolysis of nitrocefin or 7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3-[[2-[[4- (dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]pyridinio]-methyl]cephem-4-carboxylic acid (PADAC), by beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus, substrate was converted into product at a slow enough rate (at -60 or -55 degrees C, respectively) for it to be possible to do successive scans during the course of the reaction. The spectra were those of substrate and product, and no intermediate was detected. The results argue against the accumulation of intermediate acyl-enzyme. The hydrolysis of PADAC by the P99 beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae again showed spectra characteristic of substrate and product, and there was, moreover, a break in the Arrhenius plot; it is possible that a conformational change is (at least partially) rate-determining. The hydrolysis of dinitrophenylpenicillin by the P99 beta-lactamase did show features suggesting the accumulation of acyl-enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Kinetics and mechanism of the serine beta-lactamase catalyzed hydrolysis of depsipeptides.
AB  - Steady-state kinetic parameters have been determined for the hydrolysis of a series of acyclic depsipeptides (ester analogues of acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine peptides) catalyzed by representative class C (Enterobacter cloacae P99) and class A (Bacillus cereus I, TEM-2, and Staphylococcus aureus PC1) beta-lactamases. The best of these substrates, and the one most used in this work, was m-[[(phenylacetyl)-glycyl]oxy]benzoic acid, whose rates of cleavage could be followed spectrophotometrically. The P99 enzyme also catalyzed the methanolysis of these substrates in aqueous methanol solutions. Quantitative evaluation of the effects of methanol on the kinetics of the competing hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions, and on the product distribution, supports a reaction mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate whose formation is rate-determining under conditions of substrate saturation. Consideration of the variation of these kinetic parameters with the structure of the depsipeptides and comparison with the analogous parameters for bicyclic beta-lactam substrates suggest that a variety of substrate binding modes exist on this enzyme. The class A enzymes, B. cereus beta-lactamase I and the TEM-2 beta-lactamase, catalyze depsipeptide and benzylpenicillin hydrolyses but not methanolysis. The acyl-enzyme derived from both types of substrate is thus shielded from external nucleophiles; the shielding is therefore not an effect, direct or indirect, of the thiazolidinyl group in the penicilloyl-enzyme. The class A beta-lactamase of the PC1 plasmid of S. aureus is distinctly different from the above two representatives of that class, in that it does catalyze methanolysis of depsipeptides (but not of benzylpenicillin). The methanolysis kinetics suggest that deacylation is rate-determining at saturation, a conclusion supported by the demonstration of an intermediate during the hydrolysis of m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]oxy]benzoate, subsequent to leaving-group departure. The beta-lactamases have thus been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of specific depsipeptides with comparable facility to that demonstrated by D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidases. The former enzymes, however, differ in being unable to cleave the analogous peptides.
TI  - Carboxy groups as essential residues in beta-lactamases.
AB  - Beta-lactamases are divided into classes A, B and C on the basis of their amino acid sequences. Beta-Lactamases were incubated at pH 4.0 with the carboxy-group reagent 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodi-imide plus a coloured nucleophile and the extents of inactivation and nucleophile incorporation were monitored. Two class A enzymes (from Bacillus cereus and Bacillus licheniformis) and two class C enzymes (from Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were examined. All four enzymes were inactivated, with total inactivation corresponding to the incorporation of approx. 2-3 mol of nucleophile/mol of enzyme. In the case of beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus, some 53% of the incorporated nucleophile was located on glutamic acid-168 in the amino acid sequence.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - The growth and respiration of bacterial colonies.
AB  - Young colonies of two swarming organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris, grew about as quickly on solid media as in liquid culture whilst four non-swarming organisms, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus albus, all grew slower on solid than in liquid media. Oxygen uptake by young colonies of B. subtilis, followed manometrically, increased exponentially at about the same rate as unrestricted aerobic growth. All other colonies demonstrated accelerating respiration which was either not strictly exponential or, in the case of S. albus, definitely biphasic, with a fast then a slow exponential rate of increase. Actual and potential respiration was determined for each species by measuring oxygen uptake before and after resuspending the colony in liquid medium. The ratio of actual to potential respiration was largest in the flat, spreading B. subtilis and smallest in the small, hemispherical S. albus. Calculations suggest that oxygen penetrates between 31 and 41 micron into colonies of B. cereus, Ent. cloacae and E. coli and only 9 micron into colonies of S. albus.
