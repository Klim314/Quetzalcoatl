TI  == population changes in a community of alkaliphilic iron-reducing bacteria due to changes in the electron acceptor: implications for bioremediation at alkaline cr(vi)-contaminated sites.
AB  == a serial enrichment culture has been grown in an alkaline fe(iii)-citrate-containing medium from an initial inoculum from a soil layer beneath a chromium ore processing residue (copr) disposal site where cr(iii) is accumulating from cr(vi) containing leachate. this culture is dominated by two bacterial genera in the order clostridiales, tissierella, and an unnamed clostridium xi subgroup. this paper investigates the growth characteristics of the culture when cr(vi) is added to the growth medium and when aquifer sand is substituted for fe(iii)-citrate. the aim is to determine how the availability and chemical form of fe(iii) affects the growth of the bacterial consortium, to determine the impact of cr(vi) on growth, and thus attempt to understand the factors that are controlling cr(iii) accumulation beneath the copr site. the culture can grow fermentatively at ph 9.2, but growth is stronger when it is associated with fe(iii) reduction. it can withstand cr(vi) in the medium, but growth only occurs once cr(vi) is removed from solution. cr(vi) reduced the abundance of tissierella sp. in the culture, whereas the clostridium xi sp. was cr(vi) tolerant. in contrast, growth with solid phase fe(iii)-oxyhydroxides (present as coatings on aquifer sand) favoured the tissierella c sp., possibly because it produces riboflavin as an extracellular electron shuttling compound allowing more efficient electron transfer to solid fe(iii) phases. thus, it is suggested that bacterially mediated cr(iii) reduction in the soil beneath the copr site is dependent on fe(iii) reduction to sustain the bacterial community.

TI  == acetoanaerobium pronyense sp. nov., an anaerobic alkaliphilic bacterium isolated  from the prony alkaline hydrothermal field in new caledonia.
AB  == a novel anaerobic bacterium, strain st07-yet, was isolated from a carbonate chimney of the prony hydrothermal field (phf) in new caledonia. cells were gram-positive-staining, straight rods (0.7-0.8 x 3.0-5.0 microm). they were motile by the means of lateral flagella. strain st07-yet was mesophilic (optimum  35 degrees c), moderately alkaliphilic and halotolerant (optimum ph 8.7 and 5 g l-1 nacl). elemental sulfur, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, nitrate and nitrite were not used as terminal electron acceptors. yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, casamino-acids, crotonate, pyruvate, galactose, maltose, sucrose, ribose, trehalose and glucose were used as carbon sources. glucose fermentation led to acetate, h2 and co2 formation. arginine, serine, histidine, lysine, methionine and cysteine improved growth, but the stickland reaction was negative for the combinations of amino acids tested. the major metabolic products from yeast extract fermentation were h2, acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate and propionate. the predominant cellular fatty acids were c16:0, c16:1 cis9, c14:0 and c16:1 cis7 (>5% of total fatty acids). the g+c content of the genomic dna was 32.9 mol %. phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain st07-yet was most closely  related to clostridium sticklandii dsm 159t and acetoanaerobium noterae not-3t (96.7% and 96.8% 16s rrna gene sequence identity). on the basis of phylogenetic,  chemotaxonomic and physiological properties, strain st07-yet (= dsm 27512 = jcm 19400) is proposed as a novel species of the genus acetoanaerobium, order clostridiales, phylum firmicutes, as acetoanaerobium pronyense sp. nov..

TI  == description of christensenella minuta gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from human faeces, which forms a distinct branch in the order clostridiales, and proposal of christensenellaceae fam. nov.
AB  == a novel, strictly anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, short, straight rod with tapered ends, designated yit 12065(t), was isolated from human  faeces. strain yit 12065(t) was saccharolytic and negative for catalase, oxidase  and urease, hydrolysis of aesculin and gelatin, nitrate reduction and indole production. the end products of glucose fermentation were acetic acid and a small amount of butyric acid. the dna g+c content was 51.3 mol%. the predominant fatty  acids were iso-c(15:0), c(16:0) and c(14:0). respiratory quinones were not detected. the cell wall contained glutamic acid, serine, alanine and ll-diaminopimelic acid. the whole-cell sugars were ribose, rhamnose, galactose and glucose. phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequences using three treeing algorithms revealed that the strain formed a novel family-level lineage within the phylum firmicutes, class clostridia, order clostridiales. caldicoprobacter oshimai jw/hy-331(t) was shown to be the closest named relative  on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (86.9%), followed by tindallia  californiensis dsm 14871(t) (86.3%) and clostridium ganghwense jcm 13193(t) (86.1%). similar 16s rrna gene sequences (98.6-96.7%) were found amongst faecal uncultured clones of human and dugong (dugong dugon). they clustered with strain  yit 12065(t) in a distinct and deep evolutionary lineage of descent in the order  clostridiales. the distinct phylogenetic position supports the proposal of christensenella gen. nov., with the type species christensenella minuta sp. nov.  (type strain yit 12065(t) =dsm 22607(t) =jcm 16072(t)). a new family christensenellaceae fam. nov. is also proposed.

TI  == haloalkaliphilic spore-forming sulfidogens from soda lake sediments and description of desulfitispora alkaliphila gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  == an anaerobic enrichment with pyruvate as electron donor and thiosulfate at ph 10  and 0.6 m na(+) inoculated with pasteurized soda lake sediments resulted in a sulfidogenic coculture of two morphotypes of obligately anaerobic haloalkaliphilic endospore-forming clostridia, which were further isolated in pure culture. strain aht16 was a thin long rod able to ferment sugars and pyruvate and to respire h(2), formate and pyruvate using thiosulfate and fumarate as electron acceptors and growing optimally at ph 9.5. thiosulfate was reduced incompletely to sulfide and sulfite. the strain was closely related (99% sequence similarity) to a peptolytic alkaliphilic clostridium natronincola peptidovorans.  strain aht17 was a short rod with a restricted respiratory metabolism, growing with pyruvate and lactate as electron donor and sulfite, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur as electron acceptors with a ph optimum 9.5. thiosulfate was reduced completely via sulfite to sulfide. the ability of aht17 to use sulfite explained the stability of the original coculture of the two clostridia-one member forming sulfite from thiosulfate and another consuming it. strain aht17 formed an independent deep phylogenetic lineage within the clostridiales and is proposed as a new genus and species desulfitisporum alkaliphilum gen. nov., sp. nov.
