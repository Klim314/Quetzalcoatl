TI  == development of the gut microbiota in southern indian infants from birth to 6 months: a molecular analysis.
AB  == acquisition of the gastrointestinal microbiota at birth may have long-term health impacts. we longitudinally characterised major microbial communities in the faeces of a cohort of infants using molecular methods. faecal samples were prospectively obtained at several time points after birth from eighty-three infants. real-time pcr using sybr green and primers targeted at 16s rrna gene sequences were used to quantify bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus group, bacteroides-prevotella group, enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group, clostridium leptum group and staphylococcus. microbial community abundance was expressed relative to amplification of sequences conserved universally for domain bacteria. faecal copy number of 16s rrna genes increased non-significantly from a mean of 4.1 x 10(9)/g on day 1 to 1.1 x 10(10)/g on day 4. all microbial communities were detected from day 1 after birth. enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli predominated on day 1, while bifidobacteria and staphylocci increased on day 4. bacteroides-prevotella and c.  coccoides-e. rectale increased by day 180. c. leptum was detected in half of the  cohort at birth and in a slightly larger percentage by 6 months. caesarean section was associated with delayed colonisation by several bacterial communities. higher socio-economic status was associated with more abundant lactobacilli and bacteroides-prevotella at 90 and 180 d. supplemental feeding was associated with a reduction in enterobacteriaceae. microbial colonisation of the  gut was well established on the first day of birth, and relative abundance of microbial communities was influenced by mode of delivery, socio-economic status and supplemental feeding. these findings may have relevance to infant nutrition and growth.

TI  == low levels of faecal lactobacilli in women with iron-deficiency anaemia in south  india.
AB  == fe deficiency in women contributes significantly to maternal and child morbidity  in india. the intestinal bacterial flora may facilitate absorption of fe from the caecum and proximal colon. the present study investigated the possibility that intestinal microbiota of anaemic young women may differ from that of women with normal hb levels. the microbiota was quantified by real-time pcr in faeces of eight anaemic (hb </= 100 g/l) and twenty-six normohaemic (hb >/= 120 g/l) women  aged 18-25 years. sequences of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) specific to bifidobacterium genus, lactobacillus acidophilus group, bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium leptum group and eubacterium rectale were amplified and expressed (as relative difference) relative to the universally conserved bacterial 16s rdna sequences. dietary intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre and fe were ascertained by maintenance of  a diet diary for a week. faecal lactobacilli were significantly lower in anaemic  women (median 6.6 x 10(-8), relative difference compared with total bacteria) than in the reference group (2.9 x 10(-6); p = 0.001, unpaired t test with logarithmic transformation). there was no difference between the two groups with  respect to any of the other bacteria that were examined. intakes of energy, carbohydrate, fibre, fe and milk were similar in both the groups. fe deficiency in young women in south india was associated with low levels of lactobacilli in the faeces. the relationship between lactobacilli and fe deficiency needs to be explored further.

TI  == ileal microbiota of growing pigs fed different dietary calcium phosphate levels and phytase content and subjected to ileal pectin infusion.
AB  == two experiments with growing pigs were conducted to determine the effects of dietary p and ca levels, phytase supplementation, and ileal pectin infusion on changes in bacterial populations in the ileum and on ileal and fecal fermentation patterns. growing pigs (bw 30.1 +/- 1.3 kg) were fitted with simple t-cannulas at the distal ileum and were fed a low-p corn-soybean meal control diet (3 g of p/kg), or the control diet supplemented with either 15 g of monocalcium phosphate (mcp)/kg (exp. 1) or 1,000 phytase units of phytase/kg (exp. 2). daily infusion treatments consisted of either 60 g of pectin dissolved in 1.8 l of demineralized water or 1.8 l of demineralized water as a control infusion, infused via the ileal cannula. in each experiment, 8 barrows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments according to a double incomplete 4 x 2 latin square design. the dietary treatments in exp. 1 were the control diet with water infusion, the control diet with pectin infusion, the mcp diet with water infusion, or the mcp diet with pectin infusion. in exp. 2, the pigs received the same control treatments as in exp. 1 and the phytase diet in combination with water or pectin  infusion. gene copy numbers of total bacteria, lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus  reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus/lactobacillus sobrius, lactobacillus mucosae, enterococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacteria, the clostridium coccoides cluster, the clostridium leptum cluster, the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group, and enterobacteriaceae were determined by quantitative pcr in dna extracts of ileal digesta. in exp. 1, addition of mcp  reduced ileal gene copy numbers of enterococcus spp. (p = 0.048), e. faecium (p = 0.015), and the c. leptum cluster (p = 0.028), whereas pectin infusion enhanced (p = 0.008) ileal d-lactate concentration. in exp. 2, supplemental phytase led to greater ileal gene copy numbers of the c. coccoides (p = 0.041) and c. leptum (p  = 0.048) clusters and the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyrmonas group (p = 0.033),  whereas it reduced (p = 0.027) fecal n-butyrate concentration. pectin infusion reduced (p = 0.005) ileal gene copy number of the c. leptum cluster. in conclusion, ileal bacterial populations and fermentation patterns are susceptible to changes in the intestinal availability of ca and p as well as to the supply of pectin as a fermentable substrate. greater intestinal ca availability decreased the numbers of some gram-positive bacteria, whereas greater p availability in the small intestine caused by phytase activity enhanced the growth of strictly anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
