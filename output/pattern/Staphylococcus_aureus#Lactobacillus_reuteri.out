inhibition of staphylococcus aureus growth on tellurite-containing media by lactobacillus reuteri is dependent on cyuc and thiol production.
lactobacillus reuteri inhibits staphylococcus aureus growth on baird-parker agar. this activity required the presence of tellurite and was not shared with other lactic acid bacteria or an l. reuteri mutant defective in cystine metabolism. secreted products generated from l. reuteri cystine metabolism and thiols were shown to augment tellurite toxicity.
