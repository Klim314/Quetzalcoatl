TI == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI == new findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI == effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB == the aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before treatment. bacteroides ureolyticus, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci, staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which p. intermedia, p. asaccharolytica, the p. veroralis/buccalis complex and c. ochracea were isolated. regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.

TI == sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB == a filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. a total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 b. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): b. capillosus, 4; b. levii, 2; b. denticola, 22; b. loescheii, 23; b. melaninogenicus, 32; b. forsythus, 44; and b. buccalis, 2. however, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 b. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 b. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 b. oralis isolates. sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of b. gracilis, 12 isolates of b. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of b. intermedius, or 26 isolates of b. corporis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and p. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of p. gingivalis were sialidase positive. sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of capnocytophaga ochracea of c. sputigena but not in any of 4 c. gingivalis isolates. other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; wolinella recta, 19 isolates; eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. these data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
