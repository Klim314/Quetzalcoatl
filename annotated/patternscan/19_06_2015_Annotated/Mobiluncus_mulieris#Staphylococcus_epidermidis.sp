TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == [the treatment of bacterial vaginosis with dalacin v cream].
AB  == to asses the efficiency of the 2% clindamycin phosphate creme given in 3 and 7 daily courses officially designer for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (bv).  methods: the study includes 65 patients who have microbiological data for bv 11 of the women are pregnant (18.46%). the microbiological study includes there agent: streptococcus agalactiae, e. colli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, prevotella species, mobiluncus species, staphylococcus epidermidis et enterococcus fecalis. the controls visit was assessed on the 7'] and 28'] day after the therapy. results: there were successful results on the 84.3% of the patients after 7 day course but in the 3-day course the good results were showed in 73.91% of the women. after the 28"]  day there were only few successful results 43%. conclusions: the clindamycin phosphate is more preferable method for the treatment of bv.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole  against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (bv) or skin infections by agar dilution mic determinations. bv-associated bacteroides isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus-b. oralis group, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but bacteroides spp. not associated with bv, bacteroides ureolyticus and the bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. all bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of g. vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. varied. among the skin bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. this antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.

TI  == incidence of motile, curved anaerobic rods (mobiluncus species) in vaginal secretions.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as a gram stain and wet mount preparation  were made of vaginal swabs taken from various groups of women including those with vaginal discharge. the bacteria commonly found in cultures were lactobacilli, coryneforms, staphylococcus epidermidis and facultative streptococci. anaerobes were isolated from 75% (475 of 632) of specimens. the incidence of trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus species in the five groups of women varied from 2.2-5.1%, 11.5-35.7%,  23.3-36.7% and 20.0-34.8% respectively. except for candida species, differences in the prevalence of these organisms between the groups of women were not significant. the isolation rates of candida species in women attending the antenatal clinic and staff health clinic were significantly higher than women in  the other groups. mobiluncus species were found to occur either with t. vaginalis, candida species or g. vaginalis alone or with any two or with all three or in the absence of these organisms. however, the incidence of mobiluncus  species was significantly higher in women colonized with g. vaginalis (112 of 185, or 60.5%) compared with women not infected (47 of 477, or 9.8%). also, mobiluncus species occurred in large numbers when found in the presence of g. vaginalis. when found without g. vaginalis, mobiluncus species occurred in much smaller numbers. as with g. vaginalis, mobiluncus species also occurred concomitantly with certain anaerobes, mainly bacteroides species and peptostreptococci.
