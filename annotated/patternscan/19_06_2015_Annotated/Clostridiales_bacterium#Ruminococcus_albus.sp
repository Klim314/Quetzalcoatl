TI  == in situ identification of carboxymethyl cellulose-digesting bacteria in the rumen of cattle fed alfalfa or triticale.
AB  == a method was developed and used to arrest and stain reducing sugars (glucose) produced by bacteria with cell-surface-associated carboxymethyl cellulase (cmcase) and endoglucanase activities (cmc bacteria) in the rumen of cows fed alfalfa or triticale. precipitation of silver oxide on the surface of individual  cells was observed using cellulolytic bacterial pure cultures with known cmcase activity and rumen mixed cultures. the cmc bacteria in the liquid and solid fractions of the rumen digesta were identified using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) with currently available and newly designed oligonucleotide  probes. the cmc bacteria contributed between 8.2% and 10.1% to the total bacterial cell numbers. most of the cmc bacteria (75.2-78.5%) could be identified by fish probing. the known cellulolytic populations ruminococcus flavefaciens, r. albus, and fibrobacter succinogenes constituted 44.5-53.1% of the total. other cmc bacteria identified hybridized with the probe clo549 (11.2-23.0%) targeting members of an uncharacterized genus in clostridia, the probe inc852 (8.9-10.7%) targeting members of the family incertae sedis iii and unclassified clostridiales, and the probe but1243 (< 1%) designed against members of genus butyrivibrio. different forage feeds had no marked effects on the percentage abundances of these identified cmc bacteria. all appeared to be involved in cellulose degradation in the rumen of cows fed either alfalfa or triticale.

TI  == populations of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen of sheep and  the effect of diets and ruminal fractions.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the importance of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen by quantifying their populations and the effect  of diets and ruminal fractions. full-length 16s rrna gene (rrs) sequences were recovered from rumen samples using specific primers designed from partial sequences recovered previously. five uncultured bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) were quantified using specific quantitative pcr (qpcr) in fractionated ruminal samples from sheep fed either hay alone or hay plus corn. species fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus, r. flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, selenomonas ruminantium, and mitsuokella multacida and  genera butyrivibrio and prevotella were also quantified as comparison. the full-length rrs sequence improved taxonomic assignments of partial rrs sequences. genus prevotella had the greatest abundance. of the three major cultured cellulolytic species, r. flavefaciens was most abundant, followed by r. albus and f. succinogenes. the five uncultured bacterial otus, classified to genus acetivibrio, genus allobaculum, family ruminococcaceae, order clostridiales, or class clostridia, had abundance comparable to that of the above species of genera except prevotella. corn supplementation and fractions affected distribution of the rumen bacteria, but to a limited extent. when compared to the qpcr data, sequence frequencies in the rrs clone libraries tended to overestimate the abundance of the bacteria represented. this study showed that abundance and population dynamics of uncultured bacteria can be quantified by specific qpcr, which complements the results of rrs clone libraries. this study also revealed that some uncultured bacteria might be as important as some of the well-characterized bacteria in the rumen. the approach used should be applicable  to assess the abundance and potential importance of uncultured bacteria in other  environments.
