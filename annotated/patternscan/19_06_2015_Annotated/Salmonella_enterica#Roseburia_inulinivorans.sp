TI  == whole-genome transcription profiling reveals genes up-regulated by growth on fucose in the human gut bacterium "roseburia inulinivorans".
AB  == "roseburia inulinivorans" is an anaerobic polysaccharide-utilizing firmicute bacterium from the human colon that was identified as a producer of butyric acid  during growth on glucose, starch, or inulin. r. inulinivorans a2-194 is also able to grow on the host-derived sugar fucose, following a lag period, producing propionate and propanol as additional fermentation products. a shotgun genomic microarray was constructed and used to investigate the switch in gene expression  that is involved in changing from glucose to fucose utilization. this revealed a  set of genes coding for fucose utilization, propanediol utilization, and the formation of propionate and propanol that are up-regulated during growth on fucose. these include homologues of genes that are implicated in polyhedral body  formation in salmonella enterica. dehydration of the intermediate 1,2-propanediol involves an enzyme belonging to the new b12-independent glycerol dehydratase family, in contrast to s. enterica, which relies on a b12-dependent enzyme. a typical gram-positive agr-type quorum-sensing system was also up-regulated in r.  inulinivorans during growth on fucose. despite the lack of genome sequence information for this commensal bacterium, microarray analysis has provided a powerful tool for obtaining new information on its metabolic capabilities.
