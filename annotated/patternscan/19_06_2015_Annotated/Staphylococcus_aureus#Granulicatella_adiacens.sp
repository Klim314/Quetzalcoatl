TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == helcococcus ovis, an emerging pathogen in bovine valvular endocarditis.
AB  == the initial isolation of helcococcus ovis from a valvular thrombus prompted us to investigate the prevalence of this bacterium in bovine valvular endocarditis. specimens from 55 affected hearts were examined by culture using columbia blood agar and cross streaking the inoculated plate with a staphylococcus aureus strain. as confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing, h. ovis was isolated with an unexpectedly high frequency of 33%, predominantly as heavy growth and pure culture. the majority of h. ovis isolates showed distinct satellitism around s. aureus and pyridoxal dependency, resembling "nutritionally variant streptococci"  (now assigned to the genera abiotrophia and granulicatella). using the api rapid  id 32 strep, api zym, and rosco diatabs systems, incongruent results were obtained for alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and leucine aminopeptidase activities. based on the satellitism/pyridoxal dependency; hemolysis on blood agar; the api rapid id 32 strep results for arginine dihydrolase, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and pyroglutamic acid arylamidase activities; hippurate hydrolysis; and acidification of sucrose, a scheme for the identification of h. ovis and its differentiation from other members of the helcococcus genus and the pyridoxal-dependent species abiotrophia defectiva, granulicatella adiacens, and granulicatella elegans is proposed. by establishing specific fluorescence in situ hybridization, large h. ovis aggregates were specifically detected within the fibrinous exudate of the valvular thrombi. our results demonstrate for the first time that h. ovis represents an emerging pathogen in bovine valvular endocarditis that is frequently isolated if appropriate culture conditions are used.

TI  == identification and characterization of bacterial-binding property in the type iii repeat domain of fibronectin.
AB  == to characterize fibronectin binding with granulicatella adiacens, a causative agent of infective endocarditis, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human fibronectin and selected for their capacity to inhibit the fibronectin binding of the organism. thermolysin and lysyl-endopeptidase digests of fibronectin were characterized by western blot. the epitope of inhibitory monoclonal antibody was found in the central portion of fibronectin known as the  cell-binding domain, and not in the n-terminal portion known to be the binding region of most microbial species, e.g., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. while these two species could bind to both the n-terminal and central portion, escherichia coli and g. adiacens bind only to the latter. excess amounts of free fibronectin in the solution inhibited the bacterial adherence to the n-terminal fibronectin fragment, but not to the central region, thereby suggesting the central region plays a significant role for in vivo bacterial colonization in the presence of high concentrations of soluble fibronectin.

TI  == inhibition of fibronectin binding of some bacterial cells by subtle ph increase within the physiological range.
AB  == the fibronectin (fn)-binding ability of microorganisms is considered to be involved in their pathogenicities. granulicatella adiacens, a member of the oral  flora and a causative agent of culture-negative infective endocarditis, showed nearly maximum binding to immobilized fn at ph 7.2 but greatly reduced binding at a slightly higher ph 7.4 and almost no binding at ph 7.6 in the presence of physiological concentration of nacl (0.15 m). a similar ph-sensitive fn-binding property was noted with escherichia coli and abiotrophia defectiva, but not with  streptococcus pyogenes nor staphylococcus aureus. in contrast, bindings to laminin and fibrinogen observed for some of these strains were unaffected by the  same ph changes. this fastidious ph-dependency of fn-binding abilities of some bacteria warns that the ph condition must be seriously considered in the in vitro assay of bacterial adherence to fibronectin.
