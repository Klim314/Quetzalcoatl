TI  == [effects of two udp-glucose dehydrogenases on hyaluronic acid biotransformation].
AB  == we amplified genes encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase, ecohasb from escherichia coli and spyhasb from streptococcus pyogenes. both ecohasb and spyhasb were inserted into t7 expression vector prx2 to construct recombinant plasmids prxeb and prxsb, and to express in e. coli bl21(de3). after nickel column purification  of udp-glucose dehydrogenases, the enzymes were characterized. the optimum reaction condition of spyhasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 10. the specific activity reached 12.2 u/mg under optimum condition. the optimum reaction condition of ecohasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 9. its specific activity reached  5.55 u/mg under optimum condition. the pmuhasa gene encoding hyaluronic acid synthase was amplified from pasteurella multocida and ligated with ecohasb and spyhasb to construct the coexpression vectors pbpaeb and pbpasb, respectively. the co-expression vectors were transformed into e. coli bw25113. hyaluronic acid  (ha) was produced by biotransformation and the conditions were optimized. when recombinant strains were used to produce hyaluronic acid, the higher the activity of udp-glucose dehydrogenase was, the better its stability was, and the higher the ha production could reach. under the optimal conditions, the yields of ha produced by pbpaeb/bw25113 and pbpasb/bw25113 in shake flasks were 1.52 and 1.70  g/l, respectively, and the production increased more than 2-3 folds as previously reported.

TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine.
AB  == susceptibility results for pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolated  from swine clinical samples were obtained from january 1998 to october 2010 from  the animal health laboratory at the university of guelph, guelph, ontario, and used to describe variation in antimicrobial resistance (amr) to 4 drugs of importance in the ontario swine industry: ampicillin, tetracycline, tiamulin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. four temporal data-analysis options were used: visualization of trends in 12-month rolling averages, logistic-regression modeling, temporal-scan statistics, and a scan with the "what's strange about recent events?" (wsare) algorithm. the amr trends varied among the antimicrobial  drugs for a single pathogen and between pathogens for a single antimicrobial, suggesting that pathogen-specific amr surveillance may be preferable to indicator data. the 4 methods provided complementary and, at times, redundant results. the  most appropriate combination of analysis methods for surveillance using these data included temporal-scan statistics with a visualization method (rolling-average or predicted-probability plots following logistic-regression models). the wsare algorithm provided interesting results for quality control and has the potential to detect new resistance patterns; however, missing data created problems for displaying the results in a way that would be meaningful to  all surveillance stakeholders.

TI  == growth of mannheimia haemolytica: inhibitory agents and putative mechanism of inhibition.
AB  == leukotoxin-producing mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes fatal pneumonia in bighorn sheep (bhs) under experimental conditions. surprisingly, by culture methods, it has been isolated from pneumonic bhs lungs less frequently than other bacteria. however, in one study pcr assays detected m. haemolytica from over 70%  of the pneumonic lung samples that were negative for this organism by culture, suggesting that the growth of m. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria. previously, we have shown that bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. herein we report that 100% of a diverse panel of b. trehalosi isolates (n=55) tested in a bacterial competition assay inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica, suggesting that the inhibitory phenotype is conserved. further, no plasmids were isolated from any of the 30 b. trehalosi isolates tested, suggesting that the effectors are chromosomally encoded. an earlier study by us showed that pasteurella multocida also inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. however, m. haemolytica has not been isolated even from pneumonic bhs lungs that  did not carry b. trehalosi or p. multocida. consequently, we tested staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli, the bacteria that  have been detected frequently in pneumonic bhs lungs, for possible inhibition of  m. haemolytica. neither the staphylococcus spp. nor the streptococcus sp. strains inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica. e. coli inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism. growth inhibition of m. haemolytica by several bacterial species is likely to contribute to the infrequent detection of this bacterium from pneumonic bhs lungs by culture.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from diseased cattle and pigs across europe: the vetpath study.
AB  == vetpath is an ongoing pan-european antibiotic susceptibility monitoring programme collecting pathogens from diseased antimicrobial non-treated cattle, pigs and poultry. in the current study, 1001 isolates from cattle and pig respiratory tract infections were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. non-replicate lung samples or nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs were collected from animals with acute clinical signs in 11 countries during 2002-2006. pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica from cattle and p. multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and streptococcus suis from pigs were isolated by standard methods. s. suis was also isolated from meningitis cases. mics of 16 antibiotics  were assessed centrally by broth microdilution following clsi recommendations. results were interpreted using clsi breakpoints where available. p. multocida (231) and m. haemolytica (138) isolates were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to florfenicol and spectinomycin was 0.4% and 3.5% in p. multocida, respectively, and absent in m. haemolytica isolates. tetracycline resistance was 5.7% and 14.6% for p. multocida and m. haemolytica. in pigs, 230 p. multocida, 220 a. pleuropneumoniae and 182 s. suis isolates were recovered. resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tiamulin and tilmicosin was absent or <1%. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance was 3-6% and tetracycline resistance varied from 14.7% in a. pleuropneumoniae to 81.8% in s. suis. in conclusion, low  resistance to antibiotics with defined clinical breakpoints, except for tetracycline, was observed among the major respiratory tract pathogens recovered  from cattle and pigs. since for approximately half of the antibiotics in this panel no clsi-defined breakpoints were available, setting of the missing veterinary breakpoints is important.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data on escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida,  and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario swine (january 1998 to october 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in ontario, canada. in relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. these changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.

TI  == multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 porcine circovirus type-2 associated disease outbreak.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine 1998-2010. temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the e. coli and p. multocida data. although not present in the e. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within p. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of porcine circovirus associated disease (pcvad) before it was confirmed. prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the pcvad outbreak in the fall of 2004.

TI  == characterization of a trifunctional glucosyltransferase essential for moraxella catarrhalis lipooligosaccharide assembly.
AB  == the human respiratory tract pathogen moraxella catarrhalis expresses lipooligosaccharides (los), glycolipid surface moieties that are associated with  enhanced colonization and virulence. recent studies have delineated the major steps required for the biosynthesis and assembly of the m. catarrhalis los molecule. we previously demonstrated that the glucosyltransferase enzyme lgt3 is  responsible for the addition of at least one glucose (glc) molecule, at the beta-(1-4) position, to the inner core of the los molecule. our data further suggested a potential multifunctional role for lgt3 in los biosynthesis. the studies reported here demonstrate that the lgt3 enzyme possesses two glycosyltransferase domains (a1 and a2) similar to that of other bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus pyogenes. each lgt3 domain contains a conserved dxd motif, shown to be involved in the catalytic activity of other glycosyltransferases. to determine the function of each domain, a1 (n-terminal), a2 (c-terminal) and double a1a2 site-directed dad to aaa mutants were constructed and the resulting los phenotypes of these modified strains were  analyzed. our studies indicate that the lgt3 n-terminal a1 catalytic domain is responsible for the addition of the first beta-(1-3) glc to the first glc on the  inner core. the c-terminal catalytic domain a2 then adds the beta-(1-4) glc and the beta-(1-6) glc, confirming the bifunctional nature of this domain. the results from these experiments demonstrate that lgt3 is a novel, multifunctional  transferase responsible for the addition of three glcs with differing linkages onto the inner core of m. catarrhalis los.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 pasteurella species isolates.
AB  == more than 5 million americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and  intravenous antibiotics. ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is fda approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis), including those containing methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). there are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida  and pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. we therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. mics were determined using the broth microdilution method according to clsi guidelines. comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (smx-tmp). ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 pasteurella species, including p. multocida subsp. multocida and p. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum mic of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (mic(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and smx-tmp  (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also very active against all s. aureus isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other staphylococcus and streptococcus species, with a maximum mic of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving p. multocida, other pasteurella species, and aerobic gram-positive isolates, including s. aureus.

TI  == haemophilus parasuis serovars isolated from pathological samples in northern italy.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2011, a total of 106 haemophilus parasuis strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test (dg). serovar 4 was  the most prevalent (24.5%), followed by serovar 13 (19.8%) and serovar 5 (11.3%). twenty-nine strains were non-typeable (27.3%). the strains were divided into two  groups, depending on whether they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106) or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). serovars 4 and 13 had a higher prevalence in  systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory disease only. pasteurella  multocida (14/106), streptococcus suis (7/106), actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), bordetella bronchiseptica (3/106) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were isolated in association with h. parasuis.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == glutathione biosynthesis in bacteria by bifunctional gshf is driven by a modular  structure featuring a novel hybrid atp-grasp fold.
AB  == glutathione is an intracellular redox-active tripeptide thiol with a central role in cellular physiology across all kingdoms of life. glutathione biosynthesis has  been traditionally viewed as a conserved process relying on the sequential activity of two separate ligases, but recently, an enzyme (gshf) that unifies both necessary reactions in one platform has been identified and characterized in a number of pathogenic and free-living bacteria. here, we report crystal structures of two prototypic gshf enzymes from streptococcus agalactiae and pasteurella multocida in an effort to shed light onto the structural determinants underlying their bifunctionality and to provide a structural framework for the plethora of biochemical and mutagenesis studies available for these enzymes. our  structures reveal how a canonical bacterial gsha module that catalyzes the condensation of l-glutamate and l-cysteine to gamma-glutamylcysteine is linked to a novel atp-grasp-like module responsible for the ensuing formation of glutathione from gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine. notably, we identify an unprecedented subdomain in the atp-grasp module of gshf at the interface of the gshf dimer, which is poised to mediate intersubunit communication and allosteric  regulation of enzymatic activity. comparison of the two gshf structures and mapping of structure-function relationships reveal that the bifunctional gshf structural platform operates as a dynamic dimeric assembly.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == association of porcine circovirus type 2 with vascular lesions in porcine pneumonia.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the vasculature in porcine circovirus type  2-infected (pcv2-infected) lungs and to identify the pcv2 subtypes involved in porcine pneumonia. pulmonary samples from 140 pigs, 2 weeks to 7 months of age, from 36 hungarian commercial herds with clinical signs of respiratory disease were examined for the presence of respiratory pathogens, with bacterial culture,  pathologic evaluation, and immunohistochemistry for pcv2, porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus, and swine influenza virus. pcv2 was the most commonly identified pathogen (49 cases) among the 74 of 140 cases (53%) with respiratory pathogens. pcv2 was detected immunohistochemically in the wall of 13% to 100% of  pulmonary vessels (mean, 89%) in 38 of 49 cases (78%). detection of pcv2 antigen  was positively correlated with the presence of vascular lesions (p < .001, odds ratio [or]: 159.54). other pathogens capable of vascular injury in swine were found in 29 of 49 of the pcv2-positive cases (59%). the probability of detecting  vascular lesions in pcv2-infected lung was higher than in infection with porcine  reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (p < .002, or: 14.63), pasteurella multocida infection (p < .001, or: 5.75), or streptococcus spp. infection (not significant, or: 1.45). sequence analysis of open reading frame 2 amplicons was possible in 6 pcv2-positive cases, from which 5 cases proved to be pcv2b subtype  and 1 case, pcv2a subtype. in conclusion, pcv2 antigen was commonly colocalized with pulmonary vascular lesions in pneumonia in hungarian swine, and pcv2b was the dominant subtype.

TI  == influence of a pig respiratory disease on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of amoxicillin after oral ad libitum administration in medicated feed.
AB  == the pharmacokinetic properties of amoxicillin in healthy and respiratory-diseased pigs were studied, after ad libitum administration of medicated feed. in addition, amoxicillin dose linearity and drug penetration into respiratory tract  tissues were evaluated in diseased animals. the respiratory disease involves porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and bacterial agents such as  pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica and streptococcus suis. typical  clinical signs and gross lesions of respiratory disease were observed. the plasma pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by means of a noncompartmental approach. after single intravenous bolus administration of amoxicillin to healthy pigs, the steady-state volume of distribution was 0.61 l/kg, the total plasma clearance was 0.83 l/h/kg and the mean residence time was 0.81 h. after oral bolus administration, the mean absorption time was 1.6 h and the peak plasma concentration (3.09 mug/ml) reached at 1.1 h postadministration. the oral bioavailability was 34%. for oral ad libitum administration, plasma concentration-time profiles were related to the feeding behaviour. plasma concentrations at steady-state were established between 12 and 120 h. the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated (c(maxss) , c(minss) , c(avss) and auc(24ss) ) showed significantly lower values in healthy pigs compared to diseased animals. this was in accordance with the significantly higher amoxicillin bioavailability (44.7% vs. 14.1%) and longer absorption period observed in diseased pigs. amoxicillin dose linearity in diseased animals was established in a dose range of 4-18 mg/kg. on the other hand, tissue distribution ratio in diseased animals was 0.65 for bronchial mucosa, 0.48 for lung tissue and 0.38 for lymph nodes. our results suggest that the pharmacokinetic properties and disposition of amoxicillin can be influenced by the disease state or by related factors such as changes in the gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary pneumocystosis and concurrent infections in pigs in jeju island, korea.
AB  == epidemiological characteristics of swine pulmonary pneumocystis (p.) carinii and  concurrent infections were surveyed on jeju island, korea, within a designated period in 172 pigs submitted from 54 farms to the department of veterinary medicine, jeju national university. the submitted cases were evaluated by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, pcr/rt-pcr, and bacteriology. p. carinii infection was confirmed in 39 (22.7%) of the 172 pigs. histopathologically, the lungs had moderate to severe lymphohistioctyic interstitial pneumonia with variable numbers of fungal organisms within lesions. furthermore, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv-2) co-infection was a common phenomenon (12.8%, 20.5%, and 48.7% were positive for prrs, pcv-2, or both, respectively, as determined by pcr/rt-pcr). infection was much more concentrated during winter (december to march) and 53.8%  of the infected pigs were 7- to 8-weeks old. in addition, three pigs showed co-infection with bacteria such as pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis.  the results of the present study suggest that the secondary p. carinii infection  is common following primary viral infection in swine in korea. they further suggest that co-infection of p. carinii might be enhanced by the virulence of primary pathogens or might have synergistic effects in the pigs with chronic wasting diseases.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against streptococcus suis (s. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). the lowest sensitivity of s. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). isolates of  escherichia coli (e. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). the lowest susceptibility of e. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and  1.9%, respectively). over 80% of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (app) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. the highest resistance of app, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and  lxs. isolates of pasteurella multocida (pm), haemophilus parasuis (hps) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (a. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. the comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of e. coli and s. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. it is also shown that pm, hps, app and a. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.

TI  == bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions.
AB  == antimicrobial proteins in neutrophil granules exert their bactericidal activity both within the neutrophil phagolysosome and as components of neutrophil extracellular traps. this study evaluated the bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions against four bacterial pathogens of swine. porcine neutrophils were treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate (pma), then the resulting supernatants were incubated with escherichia coli k-12, streptococcus suis, actinobacillus suis, or pasteurella multocida, and the surviving colony forming units were enumerated. supernatants of pma-activated neutrophils killed an average of 95% of e. coli k-12 cells, relative to supernatants from untreated neutrophils. inhibition of elastase activity using chloromethylketone (cmk) prior to pma stimulation significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophil supernatants; 57% of the pma-induced bactericidal activity against e. coli k-12 was estimated to be elastase-dependent. the same neutrophil supernatants had lower bactericidal activity against s. suis, a. suis, and p. multocida, with 30%, 36% and 13% reduction in bacterial numbers, respectively. the cathelicidin porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (pmap)-36 and lactotransferrin were among the proteins identified in the supernatants of pma-stimulated neutrophils by mass spectrometry. these findings imply that elastase-activated proteins, such as cathelicidins, are partially responsible for the bactericidal effect of porcine neutrophil secretions, but non-elastase-dependent proteins such as lactoferrin may also contribute. further, the secretions of activated neutrophils were effective in killing the avirulent e. coli k-12 but were less effective against the other bacteria tested, suggesting that these pathogens may have evolved mechanisms to resist neutrophil-mediated killing.

TI  == longitudinal study of respiratory infection patterns of breeding sows in five farrow-to-finish herds.
AB  == a longitudinal study was carried out in five french farrow-to-finish herds differently affected by respiratory diseases to describe the carrying and infection patterns of batches of sows to various respiratory pathogens during gestation and lactation. an entire batch of sows was followed during two successive reproduction cycles. nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken from each sow 9 and 4 weeks before farrowing and 1 and 4 weeks after farrowing. mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis and streptococcus suis were detected  from swab samples using pcr assays. blood samples were tested for antibodies against m. hyopneumoniae, a. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11 and 2, porcine circovirus type-2 (pcv-2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) by elisa tests. antibodies against h(1)n(1), h(1)n(2) and h(3)n(2) swine  influenza viruses (siv) of european lineages were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. the results indicated that s. suis is widespread among sows (67.1% of pcr-positive sows). a. pleuropneumoniae, p. multocida, and h. parasuis  were detected by pcr in 30.9%, 24.6% and 23.4% of the sows, respectively. antibodies against m. hyopneumoniae were recovered from more than 55% of the sows in all herds whereas the micro-organism was detected in 2.4% of the sows. although pcv-2 and siv infections were highly prevalent, the prrsv infection patterns ranged from no infection in farms mildly affected by respiratory diseases to active circulation in more severely affected herds. the sow population thus constitutes a reservoir for a continuous circulation of respiratory pathogens and needs to be properly considered in control strategies.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

AB  == the occurrence of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections in young pigs was surveyed  in a retrospective study of 1122 datasets obtained from routine diagnostics where either suckling or nursery pigs were examined for m hyopneumoniae in lung tissue. findings were correlated with the presence of lung lesions, detection of other respiratory pathogens, vaccination history and parameters describing the herd of  origin. the prevalence of m hyopneumoniae in lung tissue from 201 suckling pigs was 2.0 per cent and, therefore, significantly lower than in lung tissue from 921 nursery pigs, which was 9.3 per cent. previous use of antimicrobials and the vital status of the pigs when delivered for postmortem examination did not influence the detection of m hyopneumoniae infection. the presence of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv)-eu genotype, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis, mycoplasma hyorhinis or streptococcus suis was correlated with a higher probability of also finding m hyopneumoniae. the history of vaccination, the time of the first or second application, and the type of vaccine (one- versus two-shot) did not influence the detection of m hyopneumoniae. a correlation between the type of herd and the presence of m hyopneumoniae was statistically insignificant and no effect of farrowing rhythm could be confirmed.

TI  == management of human and animal bite wound infection: an overview.
AB  == animal and human bite wounds can lead to serious infections. the organisms recovered generally originate from the biter's oral cavity and the victim's skin  flora. anaerobes were isolated from more than two thirds of human and animal bite infections. streptococcus pyogenes is often recovered in human bites, pasteurella multocida in animal bites, eikenella corrodens in animal and human, capnocytophaga spp, neisseria weaveri, weeksella zoohelcum, neisseria canis, staphylococcus intermedius, nonoxidizer-1, and eugonic oxidizer-2 in dog, flavobacterium group in pig, and actinobacillus spp in horse and sheep bites. vibrio spp, plesiomonas shigelloides, aeromonas hydrophila, and pseudomonas spp can cause infections in bites associated with marine settings. in addition to local wound infection, complications include lymphangitis, local abscess, septic  arthritis, tenosynovitis, and osteomyelitis. uncommon complications include endocarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, and sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation especially in immunocompromised individuals. wound management includes administering local care and using proper antimicrobial therapy when needed.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of the equine alpha-defensin defa1 against bacterial horse pathogens.
AB  == defensins are small effector molecules of the innate immune system, synthesised by various organisms including plants and animals. the peptides act as endogenous antibiotics with an antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microbes including bacteria, fungi and viruses. alpha-defensins are a subgroup of the defensin family, their synthesis is limited to some tissues and furthermore to some mammalian species including the horse. equine defa1 is an enteric alpha-defensin exclusively produced in paneth cells. the peptide showed an activity against a broad spectrum of microbes, but typical pathogens of the horse were not included in the previous antimicrobial studies. here, we report the antibacterial properties of defa1 against clinical isolates of typical horse pathogens including rhodococcus equi, various streptococci strains, salmonella choleraesuis, and pasteurella multocida. the recombinantly expressed defa1 peptide exerted potent activity against these pathogenic bacteria. the highest susceptibility showed r. equi. three genetically different strains of r. equi were killed at low micromolar concentrations, comparable with conventionally used antibiotics.

AB  == a total of 233 isolates of pasteurella multocida were obtained from 2,912 cases of clinical respiratory disease in pigs in china, giving an isolation rate of 8.0%. serogroup a p. multocida isolates were isolated from 92 cases (39.5%), and  serogroup d isolates were isolated from 128 cases (54.9%); 12 isolates (5.2%) were untypeable. p. multocida was the fourth most frequent pathogenic bacterium recovered from the respiratory tract, after streptococcus suis, haemophilus parasuis, and escherichia coli. all isolates were characterized for their susceptibilities to 20 antibiotics and the presence of 19 genes for virulence factors (vfs). the frequency of antimicrobial resistance among p. multocida isolates from swine in china was higher than that reported among p. multocida isolates from swine in from other countries, and 93.1% of the isolates showed multiple-drug resistance. there was a progressive increase in the rate of multiresistance to more than seven antibiotics, from 16.2% in 2003 to 62.8% in 2007. the resistance profiles suggested that cephalosporins, florfenicol, and fluoroquinolones were the drugs most likely to be active against p. multocida. use of pcr showed that colonization factors (ptfa, fima, and hsf-2), iron acquisition factors, sialidases (nanh), and outer membrane proteins occurred in most porcine strains. the vfs pfha, tadd, toxa, and pmhas were each present in <50% of strains. the various vfs exhibited distinctive associations with serogroups: concentrated in serogroup a, concentrated in serogroup d, or occurring jointly in serogroups a and d. these findings provide novel insights into the epidemiological characteristics of porcine p. multocida isolates and suggest that the potential threat of such multiresistant bacteria in food-producing animals should not be neglected.

AB  == tonsillar and nasal swabs were collected from weanling pigs in 50 representative  ontario swine herds and tested for the presence of 5 important bacterial upper respiratory tract pathogens. all but 1 herd (2%) tested positive for streptococcus suis by polymerase chain reaction (pcr); 48% of herds were s. suis  serovar 2, 1/2 positive. in all but 2 herds there was evidence of haemophilus parasuis infection. in contrast, toxigenic strains of pasteurella multocida were  detected by a p. multocida--enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (pmt-elisa) in only one herd. seventy-eight percent of the herds were diagnosed positive for actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae by apxiv pcr. sera from finishing pigs on the same farms were also collected and tested by elisa for the presence of a. pleuropneumoniae antibodies. seventy percent of the herds tested had evidence of  antibodies to a. pleuropneumoniae including serovars 1-9-11 (2%), 2 (4%), 3-6-8-15 (15%), 5 (6%), 4-7 (26%), and 12 (17%). this likely represents a shift from previous years when infection with a. pleuropneumoniae serovars 1, 5, and 7  predominated. at least 16% and possibly as many as 94% of the herds tested were actinobacillus suis positive; only 3 of the 50 herds were both a. pleuropneumoniae and a. suis negative as judged by the absence of a positive pcr  test for apxii. taken together, these data suggest that over the past 10 years, there has been a shift in the presence of pathogenic bacteria carried by healthy  ontario swine with the virtual elimination of toxigenic strains of p. multocida and a move to less virulent a. pleuropneumoniae serovars. as well, there appears  to be an increase in prevalence of s. suis serovar 2, 1/2, but this may be a reflection of the use of a more sensitive detection method.

TI  == associations between pathogens in healthy pigs and pigs with pneumonia.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between different pathogens in the development of pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in pigs. samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 100 pigs showing no clinical signs and 239 pigs with clinical signs of respiratory disease were examined for mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, mycoplasma hyorhinis, us-type porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (prrsv), eu-type prrsv, porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv-2), influenza virus type a, alpha-haemolytic streptococcus species, beta-haemolytic streptococcus species, pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica, haemophilus parasuis and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. these potential pathogens were detected more frequently in the pigs with respiratory problems than in the pigs with no clinical signs. pcv-2 and alpha-haemolytic streptococci  were the pathogens most frequently detected; a pleuropneumoniae was isolated in only two cases. there were more often associations between the organisms in the pigs with clinical signs than in the healthy pigs. in particular, alpha-haemolytic streptococci and m hyopneumoniae were both associated with the presence of m hyorhinis, eu-type prrsv, p multocida and b bronchiseptica, and alpha-haemolytic streptococci also occurred more often in pigs that were already  infected with other pathogens. p multocida and b bronchiseptica were both significantly associated with m hyopneumoniae, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, eu-type prrsv and us-type prrsv.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == transmission of pathogenic respiratory bacteria to specific pathogen free pigs at slaughter.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the transmission of pathogenic respiratory bacteria to thirteen 5-month-old specific pathogen free (spf) pigs, during the slaughtering process in a commercial slaughterhouse. before transportation, the spf pigs and the lorry were checked to confirm the absence of pathogenic respiratory bacteria. nine spf pigs (group 1) were in contact in a conventional slaughterhouse with finishing pigs, during 4h before slaughtering. four spf pigs (group 2) were slaughtered immediately at arrival in the slaughterhouse. five bacterial pathogens (mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis and  streptococcus suis) were detected by pcr, after slaughtering, from nasal cavities, tonsils and trachea in the two groups of pigs. lung samples were pcr negative. three and four bacterial species were isolated from the pigs of group 2 and group 1, respectively. cultures were negative from the lungs. all the bacterial species present in the spf pigs were detected by pcr. p. multocida was  isolated, from three samples of scalding water before the onset of slaughtering.  our results suggest that the spf pigs became contaminated mainly by the slaughterhouse environment and the scalding water. histological examinations revealed that during scalding, contaminated water could reach the trachea and the lungs of pigs. checks conducted at slaughter for respiratory disorders have to be carried on, but nasal cavities and tonsils are not appropriate for bacteriological investigations. moreover, bacteriological results obtained from the lungs of slaughtered pigs have to be used with carefulness.

TI  == recombinant synthesis of hyaluronan by agrobacterium sp.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha) is a sugar polymer of a repeating disaccharide, beta1-3 d-n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) beta1-4 d-glucuronic acid (glca). it finds applications in numerous biomedical procedures such as ophthalmic surgery and osteoarthritis treatment. until recently, the only commercial sources were extraction of rooster combs and from fermentation of pathogenic streptococcus. in this work, we demonstrate that metabolic engineering strategies enable the recombinant synthesis of hyaluronan in a safe microorganism. agrobacterium sp. atcc 31749 is a commercial production strain for a food polymer, curdlan. a broad host range expression vector was successfully developed to express the 3 kb ha synthase gene from pasteurella multocida, along with a kfid gene encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase from escherichia coli k5 strain. coexpression of these  two heterologous enzymes enables agrobacterium to produce ha. hyaluronan was accumulated up to 0.3 g/l in shaker flask cultivation. the molecular weight of the polymer from various agrobacterium strains is in the range of 0.7-2 md. to our knowledge, this is the first successful recombinant hyaluronan synthesis in a gram-negative bacterium that naturally produces a food product. the ease of genetic modifications provides future opportunities to tailor properties of polymers for specific applications.

TI  == occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from diagnostic samples from dogs.
AB  == objectives: to study the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens from dogs and relate resistance patterns to data on consumption of antimicrobials. methods: the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 201 staphylococcus intermedius, 37 streptococcus canis, 39 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 pasteurella multocida, 29 proteus spp. and 449 escherichia coli isolates from clinical submissions from dogs were determined by a broth-dilution  method for determination of minimal inhibitory concentration. data for consumption of antimicrobials were retrieved from vetstat, a national database for reporting antimicrobial prescriptions. results: the majority of the antimicrobials prescribed for dogs were broad-spectrum compounds, and extended-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins and sulphonamides + trimethoprim together accounted for 81% of the total amount used for companion animals. resistance to cephalosporins and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid was very low for all bacterial species examined, except for p. aeruginosa, and resistance to sulphonamides and trimethoprim was low for most species. among the s. intermedius isolates, 60.2% were resistant to penicillin, 30.2% to fusidic acid and 27.9% to  macrolides. among e. coli isolates, the highest level of resistance was recorded  for ampicillin, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, tetracyclines and streptomycin. certain differences in resistance patterns between isolates from different sites  or organs were noticed for e. coli, s. intermedius and proteus isolates. conclusions: this investigation provided data on occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in important pathogenic bacteria from dogs, which may be useful for the small animal practitioner. resistance was low to the compounds that were most often used, but unfortunately, these compounds were broad-spectrum. data on resistance and usage may form a background for the establishment of a set of recommendations for prudent use of antimicrobials for companion animals.

TI  == detection of respiratory pathogens in porcine lung tissue and lavage fluid.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare the detection rate of bacterial agents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), taken without visual control, to that in  affected lung tissue obtained from the same pig at necropsy. balf and affected lung tissue were examined for mycoplasma hyopneumoniae using pcr, and standard cultural methods were used for actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis. all pigs with a history of respiratory symptoms were submitted as live animals for routine diagnostic examination. in each animal the site of lavage, marked by injecting methylene blue, differed from the site of pneumonic lesions.  m. hyopneumoniae was detected more frequently in lung tissue than in balf in cases with moderate or severe lung lesions. the detection rates of m. hyopneumoniae were higher in the balf of pigs with mild lesions. cultural examination of balf was at least as satisfactory as affected lung tissue for detecting b. bronchiseptica, h. parasuis and p. multocida.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in italy for treatment of canine infections. of the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by peptostreptococcus + porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin  + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics  tested. the emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.

TI  == the functional molecular mass of the pasteurella hyaluronan synthase is a monomer.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha), a linear polysaccharide composed of beta1,3-glcnac-beta1,4-glcua repeats, is found in the extracellular matrix of vertebrate tissues as well as the capsule of several pathogenic bacteria. all known ha synthases (hass) are dual-action glycosyltransferases that catalyze the addition of two different sugars from udp-linked precursors to the growing ha chain. the bacterial hyaluronan synthase, pmhas from gram-negative pasteurella multocida, is a 972-residue membrane-associated protein. previously, the gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes enzyme, sphas (419 residues), and the vertebrate enzyme, xlhas1 (588 residues), were found to function as monomers of protein, but the pmhas is not similar at the protein sequence level and has quite different enzymological properties. we have utilized radiation inactivation to measure the  target size of recombinant full-length and truncated pmhas. the target size of has activity was confirmed using internal enzyme standards of known molecular weight. we found that the pasteurella ha synthase protein functions catalytically as a monomer. functional truncated soluble pmhas also behaves as a polypeptide monomer as assessed by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering.

TI  == gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  == in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.

TI  == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == results of the antimicrobial agent susceptibility study raised in a representative, cross-sectional monitoring study on a national basis.
AB  == the use of antimicrobial substances in human and veterinary medicine inevitably results in a selection pressure for drug resistance in exposed bacteria. preventive measures, apt to avoid the consequent development of new resistances and selection for existing ones, respectively, have to be elaborated. moreover, it has to be ensured that neither resistant bacteria nor resistance genes are spread to and consequently via the food chain. respiratory diseases as well as mastitis in dairy cattle belong to the most frequently occurring diseases in food-producing animals. for the first time in germany, a comprehensive, cross-sectional study into the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria associated with these disease patterns in food-producing animals was conducted by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) in 2001. the selection of examined bacterial species comprised pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica associated with respiratory disease in pigs, and escherichia coli, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis in  dairy cattle. bacterial strains were collected following a representative sampling scheme, taking into account the total number of animals in the individual german federal lander. in an analogous study conducted in 2002/2003, this selection was extended by the indication respiratory disease in juvenile cattle, caused by p. multocida and m. haemolytica, respectively. in comparison with data from 2001, mic values determined in 2002/2003 suggested significantly lower or higher degrees of drug susceptibility only for a few antimicrobial agents. comparison was carried out on the basis of bacterial species and individual federal lander, respectively. overall, the data raised in both studies revealed substantially lower resistance rates than published for germany so far.  this is particularly true for results from those lander, whose animal health services had implemented preventive strategies to control infectious diseases. no correlation could be established between differing animal population densities and differences in the prevalence of resistance in corresponding lander. however, the geographical distribution of occurrence of resistance against beta-lactam antimicrobial agents suggests different therapeutic strategies employed in different sized animal flocks. in federal lander marked by large-scale livestock  farming, significantly higher resistance values could be measured for cephalosporins than for penicillins, whereas in lander with rather traditional farming structures, resistance to penicillins was predominant. assuming otherwise similar factors of influence on the emergence of resistance, this pattern suggests that cephalosporins are preferably used in large enterprises and penicillins in smaller farms, respectively. currently, mechanisms effecting changes in antimicrobial resistance are being further investigated in a successive study.

TI  == monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria from livestock animals.
AB  == facing the problem of development and spreading of bacterial resistance, preventive strategies are considered the most appropriate means to counteract. the establishment of corresponding management options relies on scientifically defensible efforts to obtain objective data on the prevalence of bacterial resistance in healthy and diseased livestock. additionally, detailed statistics are needed on the overall amount of antimicrobial agents dispensed in germany. the collection of valid data on the prevalence of resistance requires representative and cross-sectional studies. the german national antimicrobial resistance monitoring of the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis. essential key features determining the design of these studies comprise (1) a statistically valid sampling program. this incorporates regional differences in animal population density, (2) the avoidance of "copy strains", (3) testing of no more than two bacterial strains belonging to one species per herd, (4) testing only if no antimicrobial therapy preceded sample collection, and (5) the use of standardized methods [e.g. microdilution broth method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)]. the analysis and interpretation of this data permits reliable identification and definition of epidemiological characteristics of resistance and its development in animal associated bacteria, such as geographically and time wise differentiated profiles on its prevalence, the emergence of unknown phenotypes of resistance and an assessment of the threat resistant bacteria from animals pose for humans. in applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation. the susceptibility testing performed by the bvl suggests substantially lower degrees of resistance in bacteria isolated from cattle (mastitis: escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp.; respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica) and pigs (respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica) in comparison to data published for germany so far. this includes results for substances that have given cause for frequent debate. only rare cases of resistance to enrofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) could be detected, and only 3% of bacterial strains tested proved resistant to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, including substances prescribed in human medicine.

TI  == pcr evaluation of false-positive signals from two automated blood-culture systems.
AB  == rapid detection of micro-organisms from blood is one of the most critical functions of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. automated blood-culture systems reduce the time needed to detect positive cultures, and reduce specimen handling. the false-positive rate of such systems is 1-10%. in this study, the presence of pathogens in 'false-positive' bottles obtained from bactec 9050 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (biomerieux) systems was investigated by eubacterial and fungal pcr. a total of 169 subculture-negative aerobic blood-culture bottles (104 bact/alert and 65 bactec) were evaluated. both fungal  and eubacterial pcrs were negative for all bactec bottles. fungal pcr was also negative for the bact/alert system, but 10 bottles (9.6%) gave positive results by eubacterial pcr. sequence analysis of the positive pcr amplicons indicated the presence of the following bacteria (number of isolates in parentheses): pasteurella multocida (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), staphylococcus hominis (1), micrococcus sp. (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), corynebacterium spp. (2), brachibacterium sp. (1) and arthrobacter/rothia sp. (1). antibiotic usage by the  patients may be responsible for the inability of the laboratory to grow these bacteria on subcultures. for patients with more than one false-positive bottle, molecular methods can be used to evaluate the microbial dna in these bottles. false positives from the bactec system may be due to elevated patient leukocyte counts or the high sensitivity of the system to background increases in co(2) concentration.

TI  == characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (gshf) of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ecl) and glutathione synthetase (gs) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ecl is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas gs enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain atp-grasp fold. this generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the pasteurellaceae member haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed gshf), as has been reported recently for the  gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes. here, we show that yet another member of the pasteurellaceae family, pasteurella  multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and gshf-driven biosynthesis. domain architecture analysis shows that this p. multocida gshf bifunctional ligase contains an n-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ecl-like domain followed by a typical atp-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known gs ligases. recombinant p. multocida gshf overexpresses as an approximately 85-kda protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. the gamma-ecl activity of gshf is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (k(i) = 13.6 mm). furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of gshf proteins.

TI  == hyaluronan biosynthesis by class i streptococcal hyaluronan synthases occurs at the reducing end.
AB  == previous studies reached different conclusions about whether class i hyaluronan synthases (hass) elongate hyaluronic acid (ha) by addition to the reducing or the nonreducing end. here we used two strategies to determine the direction of ha synthesis by purified class i hass from streptococcus equisimilis and streptococcus pyogenes. in the first strategy we used each of the two udp-sugar substrates separately to pulse label either the beginning or the end of ha chains. we then quantified the relative rates of radioactive ha degradation by treatment with beta-glycosidases that act at the nonreducing end. the results with both purified hass demonstrated that ha elongation occurred at the reducing  end. in the second strategy, we used purified s. equisimilis has, udp-glucuronic  acid, and udp[beta-32p]-glc-nac to radiolabel nascent ha chains. under conditions of limiting substrate, the 32p-labeled products were separated from the substrates by paper chromatography and identified as ha-[32p]udp saccharides based on their degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase or hyaluronidase and  by their binding to a specific ha-binding protein. the 32p radioactivity was chased (released) by incubation with unlabeled udp-sugars, showing that the ha-udp linkages turn over during ha biosynthesis. in contrast, ha-[32p]udp products made by the purified class ii pasteurella multocida has were not released by adding unlabeled udp-sugars, consistent with growth at the nonreducing end for this enzyme. the results demonstrate that the streptococcal class i has enzymes polymerize ha chains at the reducing end.

TI  == [bite wound infections].
AB  == background: the lifetime risk of experiencing a bite wound, human or animal, is approximately 50%, and bite wounds account for approximately 1% of all visits to  emergency departments. the majority of bite wounds are inflicted by dogs and cats. material and methods: a review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of bite wound infections is presented. results: the most common pathogens associated with bite wounds are streptococcus species, staphylococcus species, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus and anaerobic bacteria. sporadically other pathogens are isolated from bite wounds. human bites differ from animal bites by higher prevalence of staphylococcus aureus and eikenella corrodens. interpretation: it is important to be aware of the possibility of complicating infections following bite wounds, particularly after cat bites. phenoxymethyl penicillin should be the drug of choice in treatment of infections  associated with cat and dog bites. however, in case of slow recovery or no improvement, simultaneous lymphadenopathy or pneumonia, s. aureus or francisella  tularensis should be suspected; ciprofloxacin is recommended. for human bite infections the recommend treatment is phenoxymethyl penicillin in combination with penicillinase-stable penicillin.

TI  == [the prevalence of antimicrobial susceptibility of veterinary pathogens isolated  from cattle and pigs: national antibiotic resistance monitoring 2002/2003 of the  bvl].
AB  == the national antimicrobial resistance monitoring determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis.  during the examination period from june 2002 to july 2003, a total of 1849 pathogens was collected, following a representative german-wide pattern in collaboration with 29 laboratories. the selection of examined bacterial strains included different specimen causing respiratory diseases in fattening pigs (pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica) and cattle (pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica), respectively, as well as strains causing mastitis in dairy cows (staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., e. coli). determination of the in-vitro susceptibility (minimal inhibitory concentration) to at least 17 antimicrobial agents was performed centrally by the bvl using the  microdilution broth method. the findings approximately match results of an analogous study conducted in 2001, and correspondingly revealed significantly lower resistance-values in comparison to data published for germany so far. no correlation could be established between the incidence of resistance and differing stock densities. by means of the resistance monitoring data gathered by the bvl, the risk potential of antimicrobials applied in germany can be reliably  defined. this valuable information about the epidemiological situation of resistance in germany can be helpful to veterinarians as a decision guidance when choosing appropriate means of therapy. accordingly, the results stated by the bvl are apt to provide an important contribution to improving the safety of food-animal products. the experiences obtained from the monitoring also show that valid data about the antimicrobial susceptibility can only be raised on an interdisciplinary approach (federal agencies, county diagnostic laboratories, universities, industry). currently, the bvl put into practice a study with an extended spectrum of bacterial species and indications.

TI  == therapy of other bacterial infections.
AB  == cutaneous bacterial disease continues to account for a significant proportion of  clinical visits. the continuing emergence of strains that are resistant to available antibacterial agents creates a challenge for dermatologists, who need to keep abreast of current treatment strategies. in this article, antibacterial regimens are presented for skin infections caused by organisms such as staphylococcus, streptococcus, pseudomonas, neisseria, haemophilus ducreyi, treponema pallidum, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, pasteurella multocida, vibrio vulnificus, actinomyces, and nocardia.

TI  == seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight european countries.
AB  == this study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). strains originated in bovine diseases from eight european countries. they were isolated from gut infections (escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somnus). there was no change in the mic distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. in e. coli, a resistant population was present before the  use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. over this period the only a significant change seen  was an increase in mic(90) of e. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995  to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). all the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a mic(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. the use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.

TI  == otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == hematogenous septic arthritis in the dog: results of five patients treated nonsurgically with antibiotics.
AB  == this retrospective study evaluates the effectiveness of nonsurgical treatment using antibiotics to treat hematogenous septic arthritis in five dogs. giant-breed dogs were over-represented, with all dogs <1 year of age. synovial fluid cultures were positive in all cases, with common bacterial species isolated that included streptococcus b-haemolytic spp., pasteurella multocida, and staphylococcus intermedius. dogs treated with appropriate duration and selection  of antibiotics had clinical resolution with no residual deficits. this report and a previous clinical report demonstrate that hematogenous septic arthritis can be  successfully treated nonsurgically with antibiotic therapy.

TI  == experimental pneumococcal pleural empyema model: the effect of moxifloxacin.
AB  == objectives: pleural empyema is a serious complication of pneumonia, the optimal therapy of which is still unknown. the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of moxifloxacin in this condition. methods: pleural empyema was induced in rabbits by intrapleural administration of pasteurella multocida (10(5-6) cfu)  or turpentine (0.3 ml) followed 3 h later by instillation of streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc 49619) (10(6) cfu) into the pleural cavity. the mics of moxifloxacin for s. pneumoniae and p. multocida were 0.4 and 0.05 mg/l, respectively. starting 30 h following s. pneumoniae challenge intramuscular moxifloxacin 12.5 and 25 mg/kg was administered x 4 (every 12 h). pleural empyema fluid samples were obtained for bacterial count at 12 h intervals following the first three moxifloxacin administrations. moxifloxacin levels in pleural empyema  and serum samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min and 12 h  after the 4th dose and determined by bioassay. results: in control animals, s. pneumoniae (and p. multocida) persisted in the pleural empyema. s. pneumoniae also persisted in the pleural empyema fluid when moxifloxacin was administered at 12.5 mg/kg (x4 administrations). mean serum and pleural empyema peak moxifloxacin levels (following the 25 mg/kg dose) were 7.6 (+/-3.2) and 4.8 (+/-2.5) mg/l, respectively. pleural empyema peak moxifloxacin concentration lagged 1 h after serum moxifloxacin. serum and pleural empyema half-lives were approximately 1.5 and approximately 6 h, respectively. serum auc(1-12) was 29.4 (+/-6.8) mg.h/l and serum area under the inhibitory concentration curve (auic) was 73.5 mg.h/l. pleural empyema auc(1-12) was 34.3 (+/-11.7) mg/l and pleural empyema auic was 85.8 mg.h/l. s. pneumoniae was eradicated from pleural empyema following a single dose of moxifloxacin 25 mg/kg in 52% of the animals and in 96% following four doses. moxifloxacin was also effective in eradication of p. multocida. the rate of pleural empyema sterilization was related to moxifloxacin serum auic (r = 0.82) as well as serum peak moxifloxacin level (r = 0.84), but not to pleural empyema auic (r = 0.19) or pleural empyema peak levels. the results were similar  for both methods of induction of pleural empyema. conclusions: moxifloxacin appears to penetrate well into experimental pleural empyema and effectively sterilize it from s. pneumoniae. sterilization of s. pneumoniae is related to serum auic rather than to moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in pleural empyema.

TI  == construction and evaluation of a plasmid vector for the expression of recombinant lipoproteins in escherichia coli.
AB  == outer membrane lipoproteins are emerging as key targets for protective immunity to many bacterial pathogens. heterologous expression of lipoproteins in escherichia coli does not always result in high level expression of acylated recombinant protein. thus, these proteins do not take up their correct membrane topology and are lacking the immunostimulatory properties endowed by the lipid. to this end, we have designed a lipoprotein expression vector (pdump) that results in the production of fusion proteins containing the e. coli major outer membrane lipoprotein (lpp) signal sequence, lipoprotein signal peptidase recognition site, and the +2 outer membrane sorting signal at their n termini. to test the ability of pdump to express lipoproteins from heterologous hosts, the surface lipoprotein psaa from the gram-positive organism streptococcus pneumoniae and the outer membrane lipoproteins mlpa from the gram-negative pasteurella multocida and blpa from the spirochete brachyspira hyodysenteriae were cloned into both hexahistidine fusion vectors and pdump. high level expression of antigenically active protein from both the hexahistidine fusion vectors and pdump resulted in abundant bands of the predicted molecular masses when analyzed by sds-page. when grown in the presence of 3[h]palmitic acid, proteins encoded by pdump were observed to incorporate palmitic acid whilst the hexahistidine fusion  proteins did not. using mass spectrometry and image analysis we determined the efficiency of lipidation between the three clones to vary from 31.7 to 100%. in addition, lipidated, but not hexahistidine, forms of the proteins were presented  on the e. coli surface.

TI  == functional characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of the bacterial hyaluronan synthases.
AB  == the first gene for a glycosaminoglycan synthase to be cloned was the hyaluronan (ha) synthase from s. pyogenes, which we reported in 1993. since then, at least 20 bacterial, viral, or eukaryotic ha synthase gene or cdna sequences and two bacterial chondroitin synthase genes have been reported. during the last decade a great deal has been elucidated about the structure, function, and mechanisms of action of the bacterial ha synthases, which are the focus of this review. very rapid progress has been made in elucidating the mechanism of ha synthesis by the  ha synthase from pasteurella multocida. although little of this information is applicable to understanding the mechanism of action of streptococcal ha synthases, good progress has also been made in understanding how these latter enzymes work.

AB  == the prevalence of different pathogens detected in combination with porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv-2) was studied retrospectively in field cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (pmws) diagnosed at the iowa state university veterinary diagnostic laboratory, ames, iowa, between january 2000, and september 2001. the presence of pcv-2 antigen in lymphoid tissues and/or lung, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, together with moderate to severe lymphoid depletion and/or granulomatous lymphadenitis, was used as the criteria for the diagnosis of pmws. a total of 484 cases fulfilled these criteria. most of the cases (294/369) of pmws occurred in pigs between the ages of 8 and 18 weeks,  with a peak at 10 weeks of age. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was detected in 51.9% of the cases, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 35.5%, bacterial septicemia in 14.0%, bacterial pneumonia in 7.6%, swine influenza virus in 5.4%, and pcv-2 alone in 1.9%. in cases with bacterial septicemia the most frequently isolated pathogen was streptococcus suis. in cases with bacterial pneumonia, pasteurella multocida was the most prevalent.

TI  == occurrence of conjunctivitis, sinusitis and upper region tracheitis in japanese quail (coturnix coturnix japonica), possibly caused by mycoplasma gallisepticum accompanied by cryptosporidium sp. infection.
AB  == on a farm raising approximately 75,000 japanese quail (coturnix coturnix japonica) for egg production, the diseased quail showed clinical signs of swelling of the head, nasal discharge, increased lacrimation, and decreased egg production. the flock experienced a mortality rate of 5.7% per day. macroscopic observation revealed large, gelatinous masses of caseous exudate in the sinuses,  egg peritonitis, and airsacculitis. microscopically, non-purulent or purulent inflammation accompanied by lymphoid hyperplastic tissue with germinal centers was observed in the oculofacial respiratory mucosa. the developing stage of the lesions was abscess formation. in the investigation of pathogens, antigens to mycoplasma gallisepticum and pasteurella multocida serotype d were immunolabeled  on and demonstrated in the mucosal membranes. in addition, p. multocida, escherichia coli, staphylococcus sp., and streptococcus sp. were isolated from the infraorbital sinuses, and mycoplasma isolated from a diseased bird was confirmed as m. gallisepticum by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). furthermore, cryptosporidium sp. was frequently found in the brush border. serological, bacteriological and pcr examinations, some with negative outcomes, were carried out concerning microbes that are known to cause swollen heads in birds (haemophilus paragallinarum, newcastle disease virus and turkey rhinotracheitis virus). the average concentration of ammonia fumes in the cages was 30.6 parts/106, which suggests that the high levels of ammonia fumes promoted infection and multiplication of m. gallisepticum in the quail, and that the clinical disease then worsened due to mixed infection with m. gallisepticum and cryptosporidium sp. or other bacteria.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == tiamulin activity against fastidious and nonfastidious veterinary and human bacterial isolates: initial development of in vitro susceptibility test methods.
AB  == tiamulin is a pleuromutilin derivative used in veterinary practice for the control and specific therapy of infections in swine. this report summarizes studies to establish standardized susceptibility testing methods, interpretive criteria, and reagent details for use in veterinary methods recently developed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) (standards m31-a and m37-a, nccls, wayne, pa., 1999). a total of 636 fastidious and nonfastidious  animal and human pathogens were processed by using media and procedures described by the nccls. tiamulin disk diffusion tests used a 30-microg disk concentration,  and the proposed mic breakpoints corresponding to levels achievable in animal target tissues (lung) were < or =4 microg/ml for susceptibility and > or =32 microg/ml for resistance. correlate zone diameters for specific nonfastidious species were as follows: for pasteurella multocida and staphylococci tested on mueller-hinton agar, susceptibility at > or =19 mm and resistance at < or =11 mm, and for actinobacillus suis, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and streptococcus suis tested on enriched chocolate mueller-hinton agar, susceptibility at > or =16 mm and resistance at < or =8 mm. when actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was tested, a  susceptibility breakpoint of < or =16 microg/ml (> or =9 mm) was suggested for veterinary fastidious medium broth and enriched chocolate mueller-hinton agar. absolute categorical agreement between nccls dilution and disk diffusion test results with these criteria ranged from 90.5 to 96.2%. tiamulin susceptibility testing methods appear to be accurate in their categorical classification for indicated species, and their availability will allow immediate testing of animal  isolates to guide therapy via appropriate levels of dosing and to monitor the development of resistance for agents in this unique class.

TI  == induction of parturition with prostaglandin f2 alpha as a possible model to study impaired reproductive performance in the dairy cow.
AB  == parturitions were induced in five cows, 2 weeks before term using prostaglandin (pg) f(2alpha). two i.m. injections were performed with an interval of 24 h. all  cows calved within 5 days (average 2.7 days) after the first injection of pgf(2alpha). out of five cows, four had retained fetal membranes (rfm). each animal was sampled for bacteriological examination using uterine biopsies twice a week during 42 days postpartum (pp). jugular vein blood samples were withdrawn for pgf(2alpha)-metabolite and progesterone analyses five times per day during the first week pp and eight times per 24 h during the 2nd and 3rd weeks pp. from  the 4th week, the sampling interval was reduced back to five times per day. from  the 5th week pp, the sampling was reduced to two times per day and sampling was terminated after day 46 pp. only morning samples were used for progesterone analyses. from day 10 pp, ultrasonography (us) was performed every 3rd day until  day 39 pp for detection of ovarian activity and follicular dynamics. the highest  incidence of bacteriological species was found during the first 3 weeks pp. after the 5th week of collection, all animals were free from bacteria. the species of bacteria found were arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, escherichia coli, alpha-hemolytic streptococcae and pasteurella multocida. immediately after parturition, very high levels of the pg-metabolite were seen in all animals, with a sharp decrease to line of significance around days 9-12 pp. small increases above the line of significance were detected up to day 27 pp in cows with rfm, and after that time the levels were considered to be at baseline. low levels of progesterone were seen in four animals during the whole experimental time. in one animal, an increase was seen on day 43 pp, which was maintained until the end of  the experimental period on day 46 pp. based on us, follicular waves were detected in all animals during the experimental period. in three animals, three non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected and in two animals, four non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected during 39 days of ultrasound sessions. based on progesterone levels, only one animal was considered to have ovulated around day 40 pp. results from the present study indicate that reproductive performance of cows after pg-induced parturitions differs from those of spontaneous cases of rfm. differences regarding the resumption of ovarian activity were also observed between previous studies of dexamethasone-induced parturitions and the present study.

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

TI  == molecular directionality of polysaccharide polymerization by the pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha), a long linear polymer composed of alternating glucuronic acid and n-acetylglucosamine residues, is an essential polysaccharide in vertebrates and a putative virulence factor in certain microbes. all known ha synthases utilize udp-sugar precursors. previous reports describing the ha synthase enzymes from streptococcus bacteria and mammals, however, did not agree on the molecular  directionality of polymer elongation. we show here that a ha synthase, pmhas, from gram-negative p. multocida bacteria polymerizes the ha chain by the addition of sugar units to the nonreducing terminus. recombinant pmhas will elongate exogenous ha oligosaccharide acceptors to form long polymers in vitro; thus far no other ha synthase has displayed this capability. the directionality of synthesis was established definitively by testing the ability of pmhas to elongate defined oligosaccharide derivatives. analysis of the initial stages of synthesis demonstrated that pmhas added single monosaccharide units sequentially. apparently the fidelity of the individual sugar transfer reactions is sufficient  to generate the authentic repeating structure of ha. therefore, simultaneous addition of disaccharide block units is not required as hypothesized in some recent models of polysaccharide biosynthesis. pmhas appears distinct from other known ha synthases based on differences in sequence, topology in the membrane, and putative reaction mechanism.

AB  == the appropriate antimicrobial treatment for skin and soft tissue following acute  trauma is determined by the mechanism of injury, time from injury to treatment, environmental wound contamination, pathogenicity of colonizing bacteria, and patient-specific issues. these factors can be used to predict the risk of secondary infection of wounds. although common skin pathogens (such as staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus) cause most secondary wound infections, antibiotic therapy sometimes must be directed against unusual pathogens that are associated with atypical wounds, such as animal bites (amoxicillin with clavulanate for pasteurella multocida) and plantar puncture wounds (ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa). this customized treatment approach is also appropriate for chronic wounds, such as pressure and diabetic foot ulcers. in addition to antibiotic therapy, wound management may include surgical debridement. active areas of investigation in wound management include the use of growth factors and hyperbaric oxygen.

TI  == bioavailability of spiramycin and lincomycin after oral administration to fed and fasted pigs.
AB  == the disposition of spiramycin and lincomycin was measured after intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration to pigs. twelve healthy pigs (six for each  compound) weighing 16-43 kg received a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously, and 55 mg/kg (spiramycin) or 33 mg/kg (lincomycin) orally in both a fasted and a fed condition in a three-way cross-over design. spiramycin was detectable in plasma up to 30 h after intravenous and oral administration to both fasted and fed pigs, whereas lincomycin was detected for only 12 h after intravenous administration and up to 15 h after oral administration. the volume of distribution was 5.6 +/-  1.5 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 l/kg body weight for spiramycin and lincomycin, respectively. for both compounds the bioavailability was strongly dependent on the presence of  food in the gastrointestinal tract. for spiramycin the bioavailability was determined to be 60% and 24% in fasted and fed pigs, respectively, whereas the corresponding figures for lincomycin were 73% and 41%. the maximum plasma concentration of spiramycin (cmax) was estimated to be 5 microg/ml in fasted pigs and 1 microg/ml only in fed pigs. it is concluded that an oral dose of 55 mg/kg body weight is not enough to give a therapeutically effective plasma concentration of spiramycin against species of mycoplasma, streptococcus, staphylococcus and pasteurella multocida. the maximum plasma concentration of lincomycin was estimated to be 8 microg/ml in fasted pigs and 5 microg/ml in fed  pigs, but as the minimum inhibitory concentration for lincomycin against actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and p. multocida is higher than 32 microg/ml a therapeutically effective plasma concentration could not be obtained following oral administration of the drug. for mycoplasma the mic90 is below 1 microg/ml and a therapeutically effective plasma concentration of lincomycin was thus obtained after oral administration to both fed and fasted pigs.

TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

TI  == interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
AB  == ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease.  however, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. ceftiofur  was active against salmonella sp., pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, and escherichia coli but was not active against bordetella bronchiseptica measured by mic. based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the mic and disk diffusion data, we recommend mic breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for  intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. when these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.

AB  == a novel antimicrobial agent from staphylococcus aureus ksi1829, designated bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, sephadex g-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. purified bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 da. the peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating  at 95 degrees c for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of ala and gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of bac1829. purified bac1829 killed exponentially growing corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. a partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of bac1829: s.  aureus rn4220, streptococcus suis, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, c. renale, corynebacterium diptheriae, haemophilus parasuis, bordetella pertussis, bordetella bronchoseptica, moraxella bovis, and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == enzymological characterization of the pasteurella multocida hyaluronic acid synthase.
AB  == hyaluronic acid (ha), a linear polysaccharide composed of alternating glucuronic  acid and n-acetylglucosamine residues, is an essential molecule of higher vertebrates. the fowl cholera pathogen pasteurella multocida carter type a also produces ha in the form of an extracellular capsule in order to evade host defenses. ha synthase activity could be obtained from cell-free membrane preparations of p. multocida. the enzyme utilized udp-sugar precursors of ha in the presence of mg2+ or mn2+ at neutral ph. mn2+ at 1 mm stimulated approximately 2-fold more incorporation than mg2+ at 10 mm. on the other hand, the analogous enzyme from group a streptococcus, hasa, is stimulated more by mg2+ than mn2+. the apparent michaelis constants, k(m), of the p. multocida ha synthase for udp-n-acetylglucosamine and udp-glucuronic acid were estimated to be approximately 75 and approximately 20 microm, respectively, in the presence of mg2+, which suggests that the substrates are bound with 2-3-fold higher affinity  than by the hasa enzyme. the rate enhancement observed with mn2+ is apparently not due to better binding of the sugar nucleotide precursors complexed to mn ion  because the k(m) value, a measure of substrate affinity, increases by 25-50% in comparison to mg2+. in summary, the ha synthase from p. multocida, a gram-negative bacterium, has kinetic optima distinct from those of hasa, the analog from the gram-positive group a streptococcus.

AB  == objective: to determine whether segregated, early weaned pigs have better growth  performance and different microbial flora than those pigs raised on-site. design: prospective, observational study. animals: pigs from a commercial operation that  were known to be infected with several common swine pathogens. procedure: pigs (7 to 10 days old) were weaned and segregated from the farm of origin and compared with littermate control pigs (14 to 17 days old) that were weaned and raised on-site. pig weight was measured and microbial flora were isolated at 14-day intervals for 84 days, beginning when the pigs were 7 to 10 days old. results: at 50 days of age, the segregated, early weaned pigs had a mean weight of 23.7 kg, compared with a mean weight of 12.5 kg for control pigs. pasteurella multocida was isolated from fewer segregated, early weaned pigs than from controls. signs of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection were detected in control pigs but not in segregated early weaned pigs. clinical, serologic, or bacteriologic signs of early postnatal vertical transmission of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were not detected in either group. clinical implication: vertical transmission of m hyopneumoniae was prevented by weaning pigs at 7 to 10 days of age and segregating them off-site, without the use of medication. although medicated controls were not compared, results from this herd revealed that use of antibiotics is not the most important factor for disease control in segregated, early weaning programs. minimizing antibiotic use in disease-control protocols reduces costs as well as removes the need for extra-label drugs.

TI  == isolation of a spermatozoa motility inhibiting factor from chicken seminal plasma with antibacterial property.
AB  == a 78-kda spermatozoa motility inhibiting factor (smif) was purified from chicken  (gallus domesticus) seminal plasma by anion exchange (de-53) followed by affinity chromatography on concanavalin a-sepharose. the factor is thermostable and inhibited the spermatozoa motility in a dose dependent manner. in addition, smif  inhibited the growth of gram negative bacteria, pasteurella multocida but not gram positive streptococcus equi. the factor lost its spermatozoa immobilizing property after treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin or pepsin. the inhibition of  smif by beta-mercaptoethanol suggest the involvement of disulfide bonds in its activity. similarly, this property was lost in presence of chicken seminal plasma or incubating smif with anti-smif antibodies. evidence is provided for the presence of a high molecular weight protein (> 100 kda) in chicken seminal plasma that neutralizes the motility inhibiting property of smif. no significant decrease in spermatozoa atp was observed in presence of smif suggesting that the  loss of spermatozoa motility was due to factors other than depletion in cell's energy. using anti-smif antibodies, a cross-reactive protein was identified in the blood, liver and reproductive tissues of chicken and the seminal plasma of cattle and buffalo. however, the cross-reactive protein failed to inhibit chicken spermatozoa motility. the significance of smif in chicken seminal plasma is discussed.

TI  == [role of macrolides in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in children].
AB  == macrolides are antibiotics with high intracellular concentrations. they have a bacteriostatic activity but are also bactericides for concentrations five times greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration, concentrations in which they reach in the respiratory tract. they are usually active on streptococcus, neisseria, moraxella catarrhalis, listeria monocytogenes, bordetella pertussis, pasteurella multocida, chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila and helicobacter pylori. they have few secondary effects, some in relation with drug interactions. their main indications are bronchopulmonary infections due to  mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis and legionella pneumophila. they are also useful in whooping cough allowing the eradication of bordetella pertussis in the rhinopharynx, thus limiting the dissemination of the  infection in children. in amygdalitis and pharyngitis, macrolides are a good substitute in the case of allergy to penicillin. new generation of macrolides (roxithromycine, clarithromycine, dirithromycine, azithromycine) might open other interesting therapeutic perspectives.

TI  == porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome: clinical disease, pathology and immunosuppression.
AB  == porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (prrs) was first known as blue-eared pig disease in the united kingdom and the causative agent as 'lelystad virus'. the disease is characterised by very variable clinical signs, including reproductive failure and respiratory disease. the respiratory syndrome is often associated with severe infection with secondary bacterial agents including pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis and streptococcus suis. however, some seropositive herds show no clinical signs of disease. the secondary infections may be facilitated by the destruction of circulating lymphocytes, by the destruction of the mucociliary clearance system and, most importantly, by a large reduction in the numbers of alveolar macrophages. the clinical syndrome observed  in a herd may therefore depend in part upon the other diseases present.

AB  == a retrospective study of 256 cases of naturally acquired streptococcus suis infections in swine submitted to the indiana animal disease diagnostic laboratory from 1985 to 1989 was undertaken to describe the clinical signs, lesions, and coexisting organisms associated with s. suis serotypes 1-8 and 1/2. infected pigs generally had clinical signs and gross lesions referable to either the respiratory system or to the central nervous system (cns), but not both. neurologic signs were inversely related to gross lesions in the respiratory tract (r2 = -0.19, p = 0.003), as were respiratory signs and gross lesions in the cns (r2 = -0.19, p = 0.003). suppurative bronchopneumonia was the most common gross lesion observed (55.2%, overall). fibrinous and/or suppurative pleuritis, epicarditis, pericarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, and polyserositis were also reported. in 68% of the pigs, other bacteria in addition to s. suis were isolated. escherichia coli (35.0%) and pasteurella multocida (30.0%) were the most commonly recovered bacterial agents. mycoplasma and viral agents were identified less often, and their role in the development of streptococcosis was difficult to assess. in pigs infected with serotypes 2-5, 7, 8, and 1/2, suppurative meningitis with suppurative or nonsuppurative encephalitis, suppurative bronchopneumonia, fibrinopurulent epicarditis, multifocal myocarditis, and cardiac vasculitis were the most common microscopic lesions observed, whereas pigs infected with serotype 1 generally presented with suppurative meningitis and interstitial pneumonia. microscopic lesions were morphologically similar among serotypes and were also similar to those reported with other pyogenic bacteria.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteria isolated from nasal and tonsillar samples of clinically healthy rocky mountain bighorn and domestic sheep.
AB  == nasal and tonsillar samples were collected from 14 free-ranging clinically healthy rocky mountain bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis canadensis) and 10 domestic sheep (ovis aries). we identified 194 bacterial isolates, including 101 from bighorn and 93 from domestic sheep. of these isolates, 115 were gram-positive and 79 were gram-negative. staphylococcus species were the most numerous gram-positive organisms and had a higher incidence in samples from domestic than  from bighorn sheep. in contrast streptococcus species were present in higher numbers in samples from bighorn sheep. pasteurella haemolytica, the most common gram-negative bacterium, was isolated from five of five tonsillar but from none of ten nasal samples of domestic sheep, and from seven of eight tonsillar and three of ten nasal samples of bighorn sheep. most bacteria isolated were considered opportunistic pathogens. however, of the bacteria isolated, p. haemolytica, p. multocida, and actinomyces pyogenes are most frequently associated with respiratory disease.

TI  == [bite wound infections: study of 22 hospitalized patients].
AB  == background: to study the characteristics of bite wounds with unfavorable evolution, developing infectious complications that requires hospital admission.  methods: the data from 22 patients admitted to the ciudad sanitaria vall d'hebron hospital for the above mentioned reason over the last 5 years were reviewed. results: the patients (8 males, 8 females and 6 children) were bitten by 10 dogs, 6 cats, and 6 men with predominance of the wound site being in the upper limb (10) followed by the lower limbs (6), head or face (5) and exceptionally on the breast (1). the most frequent clinical manifestation was abscess and/or cellulitis (13) and adenopathies or lymphangitis (4); 5 patients presented osteoarticular involvement including 3 bone fractures due to human aggression. with regard to the etiology of infection, the common bucal flora bacteria were isolated in all the cases; pasteurella multocida in 15/16 animal bites, eikenella corrodens associated to streptococcus in 5/6 human bites, fusobacterium spp. (5), bacteroides spp. (3) and peptococcus sp. (1). the most frequently administered antibiotics were gentamycin (15), penicillin (13), cloxacillin (5) and clindamycin (4). the evolution was favorable, although slow in many cases, with sequelae in 3 patients. conclusions: it is very difficult to foresee in which cases infectious complications will develop in bite wounds. according to the authors' experience, in the case of deep wounds the bacteria implied come from the mouth of the aggressor. careful cleansing, rapid administration of an adequate antibiotic and clinical control being the most recommendable procedure.

TI  == erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin: use of frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses to compare in vitro activities and  describe cross-resistance.
AB  == mics of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. clarithromycin was the most active drug against bacteroides spp. but the least active against haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was most active against h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pasteurella multocida, and fusobacterium spp. but the least active against streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. all three drugs had equivalent activities against staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. none of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (particularly escherichia coli and citrobacter diversus) and acinetobacter baumannii. although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible  to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.

TI  == dog-associated bacterial infections in humans: isolates submitted to an australian reference laboratory, 1981-1992.
AB  == over the period 1981-92, 32 bacterial isolates were referred to the microbiological diagnostic unit from infected dog-bite wounds and 10 isolates were submitted from blood cultures after dog bites or close contact with dogs. the isolates from the bite wounds were identified, or confirmed, as pasteurella multocida (11 isolates), pasteurella dagmatis (3), cdc group m-5 (9), cdc group ef-4a (8) and streptococcus anginosus (1). five of the 9 patients from whom cdc group m-5 was cultured had mixed infections: 2 with p. multocida one of which also had bacteroides sp., one with p. dagmatis, one with cdc group ef-4a and another with bacteroides sp. nine of the 10 blood isolates were identified as capnocytophaga canimorsus. the remaining one of streptobacillus moniliformis, which is typically associated with rat-bite fever, was the result of a bite from  a breed of dog (greyhound) that eats rodents. clinical notes are provided for infections caused by the more unusual bacterial isolates and their laboratory identification is described.

TI  == colonization of the pharyngeal tonsil and respiratory tract of the gnotobiotic pig by a toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida type d.
AB  == seven-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated intranasally with pasteurella multocida and euthanatized 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after inoculation. tissues from the oropharynx and respiratory tract of pigs were cultured quantitatively and analyzed microscopically. pigs remained afebrile and alert, except one that died  of acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia. pasteurella multocida was isolated in greatest numbers from the pharyngeal tonsils, but only in low numbers from turbinate, trachea, lung, spleen, and liver. significant histologic changes were  limited to the tonsil. infected pigs developed mild tonsillitis with lymphocytic  hyperplasia, and accumulation of cell debris and bacteria in crypts. capsular antigens of p. multocida, identified on tissue sections with rabbit anti-capsular polysaccharide antibody and immunocytochemical reagents, were confined to the crypt lumen. ultrastructurally, bacteria were free within crypt material or within phagosomes of macrophages or neutrophils. in a second experiment, 5-day-old pigs were infected with streptococcus suis type 2, followed by toxigenic pasteurella multocida at 7 days of age; one pig died of streptococcal septicemia. pigs developed a mild tonsillitis, and both bacteria were cultured from the tonsillar crypts for up to 14 days after infection. these studies show that a toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida, which is a causative agent of atrophic rhinitis, can colonize the tonsil and respiratory tract of gnotobiotic pigs for up to 14 days. in addition, colonization can occur concurrently with streptococcus suis type 2.

TI  == the development of macrolides: clarithromycin in perspective.
AB  == macrolide antibiotics have been available and used clinically since 1952. the class of drugs originated from a soil sample obtained from the city of ilo-ilo on the island of paray in the philippines. erythromycin has been the most widely used agent of this class called 'macrolides' because they possess the macrocyclic lactone nucleus. many esters of erythromycin are well established as agents to treat a variety of respiratory and cutaneous infections, particularly in children. there has been a resurgence of interest in macrolides as a result of the recognition of pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia and campylobacter spp. a number of new 14-membered macrolides have been synthesised in recent years with the goal of overcoming some of the problems of the older erythromycin agents. there has been variable activity of erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae;  there has been gastrointestinal irritation, particularly in adults; and the older agents are administered four times a day. clarithromycin has increased activity against legionella, and branhamella spp., and pasteurella multocida, and, with its 14-oh metabolite, inhibits haemophilus spp. it is also more active against chlamydia and against anaerobic species while retaining excellent activity against streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae. it has increased plasma  peak levels and a sufficiently long half-life for twice daily administration. furthermore, it is well tolerated. thus clarithromycin offers potential for use in those areas in which a safe, well tolerated macrolide will be used, namely respiratory, skin structure and selected diarrhoeal and genital infections.

(4x) and blastomyces spec. (4x). as for viruses one guillemot was found to have an adenovirus and another one to have a paramyxovirus. from one of the herring gulls there also was isolated a paramyxovirus, from a second one to a reovirus. three other species isolated have get to be identified. the chief cause of sickness and death in the guillemots was oil-contamination. the majority of the examined kittiwakes and herring gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. many of  the black-headed gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. in  order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain  the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

TI  == evaluation of a selective medium for isolation of haemophilus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  == crystal violet, lincomycin, spectinomycin and bacitracin were evaluated as selective agents in media for isolation of haemophilus pleuropneumoniae. no single antimicrobial agent or combination of two or more inhibited all non-haemophilus strains (escherichia coli, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus equisimilis and staphylococcus aureus) without marked suppression of 16 h. pleuropneumoniae strains. a medium containing 1 micrograms/ml of crystal violet, 1 microgram/ml of lincomycin, 8 micrograms/ml of spectinomycin and 128 micrograms/ml of bacitracin inhibited one  e. coli strain and the gram-positive strains while h. pleuropneumoniae strains were suppressed to a minor degree only. haemophilus pleuropneumoniae was isolated on the selective medium on three occasions from the nose or pharynx of two out of eight experimentally inoculated pigs. haemophilus pleuropneumoniae was recovered  from the nose of only two pigs at necropsy and from tonsil of one, whereas the lower airways in most pigs and the lung lesions in all pigs were positive. there  was no advantage to using the selective medium for the recovery of h. pleuropneumoniae at necropsy from these eight experimentally infected pigs, probably because other bacteria were absent or present in very low numbers in the tissues with h. pleuropneumoniae. the isolation rate on selective medium was higher than the rate on non-selective medium (p less than or equal to 0.1; chi 2  test) when the airways of slaughtered pigs were cultured. this was likely due to  a high degree of contamination. dry swabs placed in tryptone yeast extract with nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide gave a significantly higher recovery rate than  commercial culturette swabs in modified stuart's transport medium.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) procedures in the detection of antibodies to haemophilus somnus was investigated. h. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also pasteurella haemolytica, salmonella dublin, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium pyogenes. in complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only h. agni reacted with h. somnus antisera to any significant degree. in elisa tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two pasteurella spp.  and with h. agni. when whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in elisas, only h. agni showed any cross-reactivity. the greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by elisa with  saline extracts as antigens. escherichia coli and brucella abortus antigens failed to react with h. somnus antibody in any of the tests. a rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of p. multocida, p. haemolytica, s. aureus, s. agalactiae, s. dublin, c. pyogenes, and e. coli gave no positive reaction in elisa tests with saline extract of h. somnus as antigen. it is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of h. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by elisa of antibody response to h. somnus.

TI  == [intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  == bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. the following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with  diseases or died: escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); vibrio genitalis (3.86%); streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); proteus sp. (1.62%); staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); pasteurella multocida (0.11%). the serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. the tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. there were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == wounds of the hand contaminated by human or animal saliva.
AB  == a prospective and retrospective evaluation of 75 patients with hand wounds contaminated by human saliva (35) or animal saliva (40) demonstrates that a program of outpatient management can be sufficient for optimal care in many patients. this series challenges the proposition that hospitalization, radiographs, and surgical debridement are necessary for most such wounds. sixty-seven per cent did not have surgical intervention and no complications resulted. ninety-two per cent received antibiotics. radiographs were obtained only when bony injury or entry into a joint was suspected. delay in seeking treatment until obvious signs of infection or pain are present is common. literature review details the anatomic factors important in the natural history and control of these infections, and the changes with respect to modes of treatment for these potentially dangerous wounds. the injury is caused by bites with the hand extended or, in fight-bite wounds, with the metacarpal-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints flexed, allowing deeper penetration and then sealing of the wound when the first is opened. staphylococcus and streptococcus are the organisms most frequently found in human bites, and in animal bites; pasteurella  multocida should be considered in dog and cat bites.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.
AB  == a total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. a total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus and pasteurella, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. peptostreptococcus anaerobius and eubacterium tortuosum were  isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. it was determined that 11 isolates of corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of p multocida, and 1 of c pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. two of the c pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. as determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. in nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with c pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly przhevalskiana silenus  at the site of infection.

"booster" injections were made through the teat canal. agglutinins in the blood appeared only after a week or more. in the milk, titers  were recorded in 1 or 2 days following primary immunization. variation of titer in the blood and milk was somewhat independent. in all but 1 cow, antibody was produced against each organism in milk and blood serum. udder inflammation was observed in the experiments when a 15-day interval separated immunizations. inflammation was minimal in the experiments employing the 7-day interval of immunization. a positive whiteside test was observed following most injections, even where no other clinical signs of reaction were seen. the findings are discussed in relation to the previous literature.
