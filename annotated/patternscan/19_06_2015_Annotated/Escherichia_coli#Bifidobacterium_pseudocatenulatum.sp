TI  == protective effect of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cect7765 against induced bacterial antigen translocation in experimental cirrhosis.
AB  == background & aims: intervention in the gut ecosystem is considered as a potential strategy to treat liver diseases and their complications. we have evaluated the effects of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cect7765 on bacterial translocation  and the liver status in experimental cirrhosis. animals & methods: liver damage was induced in balb/c mice by weight-controlled oral administration of carbon tetrachloride. laparotomies were performed at week 12. one week prior to laparotomy, animals received b. pseudocatenulatum cect7765 (10(9) cfu/daily) or placebo intragastrically. all animals received escherichia coli (10(7) cfu/single dose) intragastrically 24 hours before laparotomy. a group of naive non-treated animals was included as control. liver tissue specimens, mesenteric lymph nodes,  intestinal content and blood were collected. liver histology, profibrogenic genes expression, bacterial dna translocation, serum endotoxaemia and liver cytokine levels were measured. results: bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum cect7765 showed  no significant effect on structural liver damage, as determined by histological evaluation, alpha-smooth muscle actin distribution, profibrogenic gene expression levels, total hydroxyproline levels and malon dialdehyde production compared with mice receiving placebo. interestingly, bacterial dna translocation and serum endotoxin levels were significantly decreased in mice receiving the bifidobacterium strain compared with placebo. gut barrier integrity markers were  up-regulated in mice receiving b. pseudocatenulatum cect7765 and quantitatively correlated with intestinal gene copy numbers of the bifidobacterial strain. gene  expression levels of several anti-inflammatory mediators were also increased in mice receiving b. pseudocatenulatum cect7765 compared with placebo. conclusion: oral administration of b. pseudocatenulatum cect7765 is associated with improved  gut barrier integrity and shows a beneficial effect against induced bacterial antigen translocation in the ccl4 -model of cirrhosis.

TI  == cloning and expression of synthetic genes encoding angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory bioactive peptides in bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum.
AB  == a wide range of biopeptides potentially able to lower blood pressure through inhibition of the angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) is produced in fermented  foods by proteolytic starter cultures. this work applies a procedure based on recombinant dna technologies for the synthesis and expression of three ace-inhibitory peptides using a probiotic cell factory. ace-inhibitory genes and  their pro-active precursors were designed, synthesized by pcr, and cloned in escherichia coli; after which, they were cloned into the pam1 e. coli-bifidobacteria shuttle vector. after e. coli transformation, constructs carrying the six recombinant clones were electrotransferred into the bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum m115 probiotic strain. interestingly, five of the six constructs proved to be stable. their expression was confirmed by reverse transcription pcr. furthermore, transformed strains displayed ace-inhibitory activity linearly correlated to increasing amounts of cell-free cellular lysates. in particular, 50 mug of lysates from constructs pam1-pro-bp3 and pam1-bp2 showed a 50% higher ace-inhibitory activity than that of the controls. as a comparison,  addition of 50 ng of pro-bp1 and pro-bp3 synthetic peptides to 50 mug of cell-free extracts of b. pseudocatenulatum m115 wild-type strain showed an average of 67% of ace inhibition; this allowed estimating the amount of the peptides produced by the transformants. engineering of bifidobacteria for the production of biopeptides is envisioned as a promising cell factory model system.

TI  == in vitro binding of mutagenic heterocyclic aromatic amines by bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum g4.
AB  == consumption of probiotics has been associated with decreased risk of colon cancer and reported to have antimutagenic/ anti-carcinogenic properties. one possible mechanism for this effect involves physical binding of the mutagenic compounds, such as heterocyclic amines (hcas), to the bacteria. therefore, the objective of  this study was to examine the binding capacity of bifidobacterial strains of human origin on mutagenic heterocyclic amines which are suspected to play a role  in human cancers. in vitro binding of the mutagens trp-p-2, iq, meiqx, 7,8dimeiqx and phip by three bacterial strains in two media of different ph was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum g4 showed the highest decrease in the total hcas content, followed by bifidobacterium longum, and escherichia coli. ph affects binding capacity; the highest binding was obtained at ph 6.8. gram-positive tested strains were found to be consistently more effective than the gram-negative strain. there were significant decreases in the amount of hcas in the presence of different cell concentrations of b. pseudocatenulatum g4; the highest decrease was detected at the concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml. the results showed that hcas were able to bind with all bacterial strains tested in vitro, thus it may be possible to decrease their absorption by human intestine and increase their elimination via faeces.

TI  == improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the bifidobacterium catenulatum pbc1 replicon.
AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by intestinal bifidobacterium strains act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == eleven exopolysaccharides (eps) isolated from different human intestinal bifidobacterium strains were tested in fecal slurry batch cultures and compared with glucose and the prebiotic inulin for their abilities to act as fermentable substrates for intestinal bacteria. during incubation, the increases in levels of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were considerably more pronounced in cultures with eps, glucose, and inulin than in controls without carbohydrates added, indicating that the substrates assayed were fermented by intestinal bacteria. shifts in molar proportions of scfa during incubation with eps and inulin caused a decrease in the acetic acid-to-propionic acid ratio, a possible indicator of the hypolipidemic effect of prebiotics, with the lowest values for this parameter being obtained for eps from the species bifidobacterium longum and from bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strain c52. this behavior was contrary to that  found with glucose, a carbohydrate not considered to be a prebiotic and for which a clear increase of this ratio was obtained during incubation. quantitative real-time pcr showed that eps exerted a moderate bifidogenic effect, which was comparable to that of inulin for some polymers but which was lower than that found for glucose. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna gene fragments using universal primers was employed to analyze microbial groups other  than bifidobacteria. changes in banding patterns during incubation with eps indicated microbial rearrangements of bacteroides and escherichia coli relatives. moreover, the use of eps from b. pseudocatenulatum in fecal cultures from some individuals accounted for the prevalence of desulfovibrio and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas incubation with eps from b. longum supported populations close to anaerostipes, prevotella, and/or oscillospira. thus, eps synthesized by  intestinal bifidobacteria could act as fermentable substrates for microorganisms  in the human gut environment, modifying interactions among intestinal populations.

TI  == characterization of the genus bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacteria protect mice from lethal infection with shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the anti-infectious activity of probiotic bifidobacteria against shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 was examined in a fatal mouse stec infection model. stable colonization of the murine intestines was achieved by the oral administration of bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (naturally resistant to streptomycin sulfate) as long as the mice were treated with streptomycin in their drinking water (5 mg/ml). the pathogenicity of stec infection, characterized by marked body weight loss and subsequent death, observed in the infected controls was dramatically inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. moreover, stx production by stec cells in the intestine was almost completely inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. a comparison of  anti-stec activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance  to streptomycin revealed that strains such as bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 15696  and bifidobacterium catenulatum atcc 27539(t) did not confer an anti-infectious activity, despite achieving high population levels similar to those of effective  strains, such as b. breve strain yakult and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. the effective strains produced a high concentration of acetic acid (56 mm) and lowered the ph of the intestine (to ph 6.75) compared to the infected control group (acetic acid concentration, 28 mm; ph, 7.15); these effects were thought to be related to the anti-infectious activity of these strains because the combination of a high concentration of acetic acid and a low ph was found to inhibit stx production during stec growth in vitro.
