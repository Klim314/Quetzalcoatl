TI  == production and glucosylation of c50 and c 40 carotenoids by metabolically engineered corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  == the yellow-pigmented soil bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum atcc13032 is accumulating the cyclic c50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides. carotenoid pathway engineering was previously shown to allow for efficient lycopene production. here, engineering of c. glutamicum for production of endogenous decaprenoxanthin as well as of the heterologous c50 carotenoids c.p.450 and sarcinaxanthin is described. plasmid-borne overexpression of genes for lycopene cyclization and hydroxylation from c. glutamicum, dietzia sp., and micrococcus luteus, in a lycopene-producing platform strain constructed here, resulted in accumulation of these three c50 carotenoids to concentrations of about 3-4 mg/g cdw. chromosomal deletion of a putative carotenoid glycosyltransferase gene cg0730/crtx in these strains entailed production of non-glucosylated derivatives of decaprenoxanthin, c.p.450, and sarcinaxanthin, respectively. upon introduction of glucosyltransferase genes from m. luteus, c. glutamicum, and pantoea ananatis, these hydroxylated c50 carotenoids were glucosylated. we here also demonstrate production of the c40 carotenoids beta-carotene and zeaxanthin in recombinant c. glutamicum strains and co-expression of the p. ananatis crtx gene was used to obtain glucosylated zeaxanthin. together, our results show that c. glutamicum is a potentially valuable host for production of a wide range of glucosylated c40 and c50 carotenoids.

TI  == rice seeds as sources of endophytic bacteria.
AB  == endophytic bacteria are considered to originate from the external environment. to examine the hypothesis that rice (oryza sativa, cultivar kinuhikari) seeds are a  source of endophytic bacteria, we isolated endophytic bacteria from the shoots, remains of the seeds, and roots of rice seedlings that were aseptically cultivated in vitro from surface-disinfected seeds. of the various bacterial strains isolated, the closest relatives, identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  were: bacillus firmus, b. fusiformis, b. pumilus, caulobacter crescentus, kocuria palustris, micrococcus luteus, methylobacterium fujisawaense, me. radiotolerans,  and pantoea ananatis. the latter three species have been detected frequently inside both rice seedlings and mature rice plants. these results indicate that rice seeds are an important source of endophytic bacteria. the bacteria that colonize the seed interior appear to infect the subsequent generation via rice seeds and become the dominant endophytic species in the mature plant.

TI  == characterization of microbial contamination in united states air force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  == bacteria and fungi, isolated from united states air force (usaf) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (gc-fame) profiling and 16s or 18s rrna gene sequencing. thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated usaf bases were collected. at each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. twelve genera, including four bacillus species and two staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. of the organisms identified, bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, sphinogmonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and the fungus aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. the bacteria pantoea ananatis, arthrobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., kocuria rhizophilia, leucobacter komagatae, dietza sp., and the fungus discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in usaf aviation fuel. only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and  identification techniques.
