TI  - Pharmacokinetics of enrofloxacin and ceftiofur in plasma, interstitial fluid, and gastrointestinal tract of calves after subcutaneous injection, and bactericidal impacts on representative enteric bacteria.
AB  - This study's objectives were to determine intestinal antimicrobial concentrations in calves administered enrofloxacin or ceftiofur sodium subcutaneously, and their impact on representative enteric bacteria. Ultrafiltration devices were implanted in the ileum and colon of 12 steers, which received either enrofloxacin or ceftiofur sodium. Samples were collected over 48 h after drug administration for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. Enterococcus faecalis or Salmonella enterica (5 x 105 CFU/mL of each) were exposed in vitro to peak and tail (48 h postadministration) concentrations of both drugs at each location for 24 h to determine inhibition of growth and change in MIC. Enrofloxacin had tissue penetration factors of 1.6 and 2.5 in the ileum and colon, while ciprofloxacin, an active metabolite of enrofloxacin, was less able to cross into the intestine (tissue penetration factors of 0.7 and 1.7). Ceftiofur was rapidly eliminated leading to tissue penetration factors of 0.39 and 0.25. All concentrations of enrofloxacin were bactericidal for S. enterica and significantly reduced E. faecalis. Peak ceftiofur concentration was bactericidal for S. enterica, and tail concentrations significantly reduced growth. E. faecalis experienced growth at all ceftiofur concentrations. The MICs for both organisms exposed to peak and tail concentrations of antimicrobials were unchanged at the end of the study. Enrofloxacin and ceftiofur achieved intestinal concentrations capable of reducing intestinal bacteria, yet the short exposure of ceftiofur in the intestine may select for resistant organisms.
TI  - Extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  - Sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (GTSP) and smooth hound (SHSP) skins. Their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using X-ray diffraction and Infrared spectroscopic analysis. The antibacterial activities of GTSP and SHSP against Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 43251), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enterica (ATCC 43972) and Enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and by essays in liquid media. GTSP and SHSP were fractionated by a Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. Fraction FGII, from GTSP, and fraction FSII, from SHSP, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. The sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. Overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
TI  - Chemical Assessment and Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Activities of Endophytic Fungi Extracts Isolated from Costus spiralis (Jacq.) Roscoe (Costaceae).
AB  - Costus spiralis (Costaceae) is a species native to the Amazon region and is used  in traditional medicine. The endophytic fungi used in this study were obtained from leaves of this plant. 13 strains were selected to obtain hydroethanolic extracts and were submitted to hydroalcoholic extraction and evaluated for antioxidant activity by DPPH (2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidrazil) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power), and all of the fungi had positive results. The antimicrobial action of crude extracts had a good range of activities. All extracts had inhibitory activities against the yeasts of Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis, with 125 to 500 mug/mL MIC. Eight extracts had antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis (MIC from 62.4 to 125 mug/mL), 5 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC from 125 to 500 mug/mL), 2 against Salmonella enterica (MIC from 125 to 62.5 mug/mL), and 2 against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC from 500 to 125 mug/mL). The presence of secondary metabolites, including coumarins, was observed during chemical evaluation by thin layer chromatography. Total phenol content was estimated, and a strong positive correlation to antioxidant activity was observed, according to its Pearson coefficient. This is the first report of the bioactive potential of endophytic fungi isolated from the Costaceae family in Brazilian ecosystems.
TI  - Effects of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. However, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. One possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. Reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic E. faecium strain NCIMB10415 (SF68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. Growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. Additionally, total DNA was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. Co-cultivation with eight Enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. Three of four E. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. PCR results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with E. faecium DSM 6177. Three of four Enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. However, E. faecalis DSM 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic E. faecium strain. The growth of Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 10533 and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with Lactobacillus mucosae DSM13345 or Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM10533 showed no differences. Co-cultures with the probiotic E. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of Salmonella enterica and 2 strains of Escherichia coli), but PCR results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic E. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. As the in vitro effect of the probiotic E. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of certain Lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.
TI  - The question of pathogen quantification in disinfected graywater.
AB  - Graywater (GW) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One of the major impediments to GW reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. This study monitored three similar on-site GW treatment systems bi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected [by chlorine and ultraviolet light (UV)] GW. The systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. The samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent DNA-based methods. Results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various GW streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). The culture-dependent analyses suggested that both chlorine and UV inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated GW, albeit at different efficiencies. Conversely, the DNA-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated GW with or without disinfection. To better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using Enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. We suggest that disinfection of biologically treated GW with chlorine or UV is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be estimated by DNA-based qPCR.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Estimation of cultivable bacterial diversity in the cloacae and pharynx in Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus).
AB  - In this work, we describe the biodiversity of cloacal and pharynx culture-based bacteria (commensal and pathogenic), in 75 Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from two geographic areas. We address the question of whether the cultivable microbiota of vultures is organised into assemblages occurring by chance. In addition, we assess bacterial diversity in both anatomic regions and geographic areas. Bacterial diversity was represented by 26 Gram-negative and 20 Gram-positive genera. The most common genera were Escherichia, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Lactococcus. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples. Staphylococcus and Erysipelothrix were isolated from the pharynx and Salmonella and Corynebacterium from the cloacae, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the cloacal swabs. Ten cloacal swabs were positive for Salmonella, of which five isolates were Salmonella enterica serotype 4,(5),12:i:-, one isolate was S. enterica serotype Derby, three isolates were S. enterica serotype 61:k:1,5,7 and one isolate was S. enterica serotype Infantis. The null modelling approach revealed that the commensal bacteria of vultures are not structured in assemblages. On the other hand, differences in bacterial genus and species richness between cloacal and pharyngeal samples or between geographic areas were clear, with the pharynx in vultures from both geographic areas being richer. The results of this study indicate also that vultures can serve as a reservoir of certain pathogenic zoonotic bacteria. The dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens in wildlife could be prevented by periodic sanitary surveys.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. Monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's abdomen. Milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. Using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel Monotreme Lactation Protein (MLP) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. We show that platypus and short-beaked echidna MLP genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. The MLP transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. Analysis of recombinant MLP showed that it is an N-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that MLP is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein, a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. Functional analysis revealed MLP antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and commensal Enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella enterica. Our data suggest that MLP is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. We propose that MLP evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.
TI  - A comparison of conventional methods for the quantification of bacterial cells after exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to potential interference of nanoparticles on bacterial quantification, there is a challenge to develop a fast, accurate and reproducible method for bacterial quantification. Currently various bacterial quantification methods are used by researchers performing nanoparticles study, but there has been no efficacy evaluation of these methods. Here we study interference of nanoparticles on three most commonly used conventional bacterial quantification methods, including colony counting to determine the colony-forming units (CFU), spectrophotometer method of optical density (OD) measurement, and flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Three oxide nanoparticles including ZnO, TiO2, and SiO2 and four bacterial species including Salmonella enterica serovar Newport, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli were included in the test. Results showed that there is no apparent interference of the oxide nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by FCM measurement; CFU counting is time consuming, less accurate and not suitable for automation; and the spectrophotometer method using OD measurement was the most unreliable method to quantify and detect the bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: In summary, FCM measurement proved to be the best method, which is suitable for rapid, accurate and automatic detection of bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles.
TI  - Innate host defense requires TFEB-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
AB  - Animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. Understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. TFEB was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our data suggest that TFEB is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis from healthy infants modulates inflammation through MAPK signaling pathways.
AB  - Colonizing commensal bacteria after birth are required for the proper development of the gastrointestinal tract. It is believed that bacterial colonization pattern in neonatal gut affects gut barrier function and immune system maturation. Studies on the development of faecal microbiota in infants showed that the neonatal gut was first colonized with enterococci followed by other microbiota such as Bifidobacterium. Other studies showed that babies who developed allergy were less often colonized with Enterococcus during the first month of life as compared to healthy infants. Many studies have been conducted to elucidate how bifidobacteria or lactobacilli, some of which are considered probiotic, regulate infant gut immunity. However, fewer studies have been focused on enterococi. In our study, we demonstrate that E. faecalis, isolated from healthy newborns, suppress inflammatory responses activated in vivo and in vitro. We found E. faecalis attenuates proinflammatory cytokine secretions, especially IL-8, through JNK and p38 signaling pathways. This finding shed light on how the first colonizer, E.faecalis, regulates inflammatory responses in the host.
TI  - High inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Listeria monocytogenes by Enterococcus isolated from different sources in Tunisia and identification of their bacteriocin genes.
AB  - A total of 300 isolates of Enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in Tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. Amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. Genes encoding for entA, entP, entB, entL50A/B, AS-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by PCR. The bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii and Enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. Antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Paenibacillus larvae. The inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase K treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. Only three bacteriocin genes, namely entP, entA and entL50A/B were detected in the isolates included in this study. Enterocins A and P were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55 (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin L50A/B present in 27 isolates (45.7%). These newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as biological control of foulbrood disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. The antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. With the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. Fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus showed high activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood. Enterocins A, P and L50A/B were found in various combinations. The most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of P. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the disease in honeybees.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis subverts and invades the host urothelium in patients with chronic urinary tract infection.
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTI) are a major growing concern worldwide. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli has been shown to invade the urothelium during acute UTI in mice and humans, forming intracellular reservoirs that can evade antibiotics and the immune response, allowing recurrence at a later date. Other bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumonia and Salmonella enterica have also been shown to be invasive in acute UTI. However, the role of intracellular infection in chronic UTI causing more subtle lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a particular problem in the elderly population, is poorly understood. Moreover, the species of bacteria involved remains largely unknown. A previous study of a large cohort of non-acute LUTS patients found that Enterococcus faecalis was frequently found in urine specimens. E. faecalis accounts for a significant proportion of chronic bladder infections worldwide, although the invasive lifestyle of this uropathogen has yet to be reported. Here, we wanted to explore this question in more detail. We harvested urothelial cells shed in response to inflammation and, using advanced imaging techniques, inspected them for signs of bacterial pathology and invasion. We found strong evidence of intracellular E. faecalis harboured within urothelial cells shed from the bladder of LUTS patients. Furthermore, using a culture model system, these patient-isolated strains of E. faecalis were able to invade a transitional carcinoma cell line. In contrast, we found no evidence of cellular invasion by E. coli in the patient cells or the culture model system. Our data show that E. faecalis is highly competent to invade in this context; therefore, these results have implications for both the diagnosis and treatment of chronic LUTS.
TI  - Prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-IIIa and aph(3')-IIa in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Austria.
AB  - The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-IIa primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-IIIa also inactivates amikacin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in Austria. In total, 10 541 Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. Isolates were analysed by aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII- and aph(3')-IIa/nptII-specific TaqMan real-time PCR. For positive strains, MICs using Etests were performed and resistance gene sequences were determined. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). In Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., the aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %), 0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. Eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). Escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), Staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and P. aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-IIa. A single Salmonella isolate was positive, resulting in an aph(3')-IIa prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-IIIa. aph(3')-IIa/nptII genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene pool during the observation period.
TI  - Ammonia sanitisation of sewage sludge using urea.
AB  - The aim of the study was to develop a simple, low-cost treatment for sewage sludge using urea as a sanitising agent. Sewage sludge was spiked with Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella typhimurium, treated with 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2% w/w urea at laboratory scale, and the viability was monitored during 4 months of storage at 4, 10 and 22 degrees C (only 0.5%). A linear relationship was identified between Salmonella spp. inactivation rate and ammonia (NH3) concentration. Temperature had a positive impact on Salmonella spp. inactivation at higher temperatures, but in the range 4-10 degrees C temperature influenced this inactivation merely by its impact on the ammonia equilibrium. Enterococcus spp. was more persistent and a lag phase of up to 11 weeks was observed. Higher temperature and ammonia concentration reduced the lag phase duration significantly, and also had a clear effect on the inactivation rate for the treatments with 0.5% urea at 22 degrees C and 2% urea at 4 and 10 degrees C. Urea sanitisation of sewage sludge can give a 2 log10 reduction of Enterococcus spp. and more than a 5 log10 reduction of Salmonella spp. within 6 weeks with either 0.5% w/w urea at 22 degrees C or 2% urea at 10 degrees C.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - New function of molybdenum trioxide nanoplates: toxicity towards pathogenic bacteria through membrane stress.
AB  - Inorganic nanostructures are highly recognized for their potential use in the development of new functional materials for biomedical applications. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial efficiency of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanoplates against four types of pathogenic bacteria. MoO3 nanoplates are synthesized by a simple wet chemical approach. X-ray diffraction and FT-IR analysis showed the presence of an orthorhombic phase of MoO3 nanoplates. Field emission scanning electron microscope studies confirmed the formation of plate-like structures of MoO3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MoO3 nanoplates against pathogenic bacteria was evaluated using a microdilution method. MICs such as 8mug/mL (against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium), 16mug/mL (against Enterococcus faecalis), and 8mug/mL (against Bacillus subtilis) show that MoO3 nanoplates have predominant antibacterial activity compared to the standard antibiotic, kanamycin. Evaluation of bacterial enzymatic (beta-d-galactosidase) activity in the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenol and beta-d-galactopyranoside suggested the disruption of the bacterial cell wall mechanism responsible for bacterial toxicity.
TI  - Food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - Wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. Urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain (n=41). Salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% CI 0.61-16.91) and Campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% CI 0.6-16.53) of the animals. E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni were not found. Other thermophilic Campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% CI 8.82-34.87). Additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in Enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (50%) and Escherichia coli (10%). For the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. These findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
TI  - Conducting nanosponge electroporation for affordable and high-efficiency disinfection of bacteria and viruses in water.
AB  - High-efficiency, affordable, and low energy water disinfection methods are in great need to prevent diarrheal illness, which is one of the top five leading causes of death over the world. Traditional water disinfection methods have drawbacks including carcinogenic disinfection byproducts formation, energy and time intensiveness, and pathogen recovery. Here, we report an innovative method that achieves high-efficiency water disinfection by introducing nanomaterial-assisted electroporation implemented by a conducting nanosponge filtration device. The use of one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials allows electroporation to occur at only several volts, which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that in traditional electroporation applications. The disinfection mechanism of electroporation prevents harmful byproduct formation and ensures a fast treatment speed of 15,000 L/(h.m(2)), which is equal to a contact time of 1 s. The conducting nanosponge made from low-cost polyurethane sponge coated with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires ensures the device's affordability. This method achieves more than 6 log (99.9999%) removal of four model bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Typhimirium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, and more than 2 log (99%) removal of one model virus, bacteriophage MS2, with a low energy consumption of only 100 J/L.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of amazonian medicinal plants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aqueous extracts of currently utilized Amazonian medicinal plants were assayed in vitro searching for antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Medium resuspended lyophilized aqueous extracts of different organs of Amazonian medicinal plants were assayed by in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity. ATCC and standardized microorganisms obtained from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/Brazil were individually and homogeneously grown in agar plate, and holes previously perforated in the gel were filled with diluted plant aqueous extracts. Inhibition halos were evaluated and controlled by the use of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: The Amazonian medicinal plants, Hymenelobium petraeum showed inhibitory activity over Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans, while Vatairea guianensis and Symphonia globulifera presented inhibitory activity exclusively for Staphylococcus aureus. Also, Ptychopetalum olacoides and Pentaclethra macroloba inhibited the growth of Klebsiella ozaenae and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The aqueous botanic extracts that showed activity against microroganisms of ATTC and Osvaldo Cruz strains had at least 40% of antimicrobial activity when compared to halo inhibition produced by the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin utilized as a control. Of all plants extracts assayed, the Hymenelobium petraeum had the best performance, sometimes exhibiting higher activity than ciprofloxacin. It is not well-defined by the physicians the exact indication of the majority of medicinal plants in the Amazon area in Brazil. Natives utilize the plants according to their symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation, among Amerindians, Afrodescendents and ethnic mixed populations. A significant number of Amazonian medicinal plants are totally unknown related to their medicinal properties including mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, as very few information is reported in the scientific literature. A tiny amount of data is presented, as the preliminary antimicrobial properties of the medicinal plants here accessed, under the urgent necessity of new antibiotics in the market and in face of the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to antimicrobials.
TI  - The potential for self-sanitisation of faecal sludge by intrinsic ammonia.
AB  - Faecal sludge has the potential to be used as a sustainable fertiliser in agriculture, but the sludge must be sanitised due to its content of pathogenic microorganisms. The intrinsic ammonia from the urine may be sufficient for sanitisation of the sludge if it is not too diluted by flush water or lost by ventilation. To evaluate the potential for this sanitisation method, inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium and Ascaris suum eggs during treatment were assessed. The inactivation was studied at different storage temperatures (10-28 degrees C) and in several sludge mixes with different contents of urine, faeces and flush water, and with ammonia concentrations from 40 to 400 mM. All pathogens were inactivated by the ammonia, and ascaris eggs were the most persistent. Lower flush water volume and higher urine content favoured inactivation, mainly due to increased uncharged ammonia (NH3) concentration. The lag phase in ascaris inactivation was shortened by increasing temperature and NH3 concentration, while post-lag phase inactivation was not influenced by NH3 concentration. Faecal sludge can be sanitised by airtight storage without the use of additives when flush water volumes are sufficiently low. For temperatures of 23-28 degrees C, a 3 log reduction of ascaris egg viability can be achieved within 1-6 months depending on ammonia concentration and temperature.
TI  - Intestinal epithelial autophagy is essential for host defense against invasive bacteria.
AB  - The mammalian intestine is colonized with a diverse community of bacteria that perform many beneficial functions but can threaten host health upon tissue invasion. Epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune responses are essential to limit the invasion of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria and maintain beneficial host-bacterial relationships; however, little is known about the role of various cellular processes, notably autophagy, in controlling bacterial interactions with the intestinal epithelium in vivo. We demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cell autophagy protects against tissue invasion by both opportunistically invasive commensals and the invasive intestinal pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. Autophagy is activated following bacterial invasion of epithelial cells through a process requiring epithelial cell-intrinsic signaling via the innate immune adaptor protein MyD88. Additionally, mice deficient in intestinal epithelial cell autophagy exhibit increased dissemination of invasive bacteria to extraintestinal sites. Thus, autophagy is an important epithelial cell-autonomous mechanism of antibacterial defense that protects against dissemination of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Internalisation potential of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  - The internalisation potential of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. Sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) CFU/mL) and used to irrigate the plants. The potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. Additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. Internalisation of each of the human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. In addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four pathogens evaluated in this study. A low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis were identified.
TI  - Assessment of pathogenic bacteria in treated graywater and irrigated soils.
AB  - Reuse of graywater (GW) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One major impediment for reuse of GW is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. The presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three GW recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. The treated GW and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative PCR. As a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (FW) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. Comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Shigella spp., were found in the treated GW, their corresponding irrigated soils and the FW-irrigated soils. Moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the GW- and FW-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. Our results suggest that GW irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.
TI  - Screening for polyphenols, antioxidant and antimicrobial activitiesof extracts from eleven Helianthemum taxa (Cistaceae) used in folk medicine in south-eastern Spain.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Helianthemum genus contains approximately one hundred taxa. Some of them are important medicinal plants used in several countries for many different purposes. However, studies addressing the phytochemistry of many of these species or their biological activities are currently nonexistent. AIM OF THE STUDY: To perform a comparative analysis of the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites and biological activities of the leaves of the most commonly distributed and used Spanish Helianthemum taxa in order to find a relationship between chemotype, biological activity and uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: water and 80% methanolic extracts derived from 11 different Helianthemum taxa were analyzed for their phytochemical composition using standard methods. Furthermore, HPLC analysis was performed for the estimation of gallic acid, ellagic acid, tannins and flavonols as marker compounds. The antioxidant activity was measured by employing the scavenging activity on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radicals. The 80% methanolic extracts were evaluated for antibacterial (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) activity using the micro dilution technique. RESULTS: The total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capabilities differed significantly among the Helianthemum leaf extracts. A strong correlation between total phenolic content, antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity was found. The polyphenolic profile was specific for each taxon. Whereas Helianthemum alypoides, Helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, Helianthemum hirtum, Helianthemum asperum, and Helianthemum marifolium subsp. marifolium were characterized by the presence of gallic acid, egallic derivatives and ellagitannins; the polyphenolic profile of Helianthemum apenninum subsp. cavanillesianum, Helianthemum syriacum and Helianthemum polygonoides was mostly based on flavonoids. Helianthemum cinereum, Helianthemum alypoides and Helianthemum marifolium consistently presented the strongest radical scavenging activity (in water extracts EC50 ranges from 29.88 to 38.1 against DPPH and from 8.11 to 20.8 against ABTS, and in 80% MeOH extracts from 25.3 to 31.8 against DPPH and from 6.15 to 8.6 against ABTS), total phenol content (>117mg GAE/l) and antimicrobial activities. CONCLUSION: The Helianthemum taxa used in folk medicine did not cluster in a unique section, being equally distributed in two out of the four sections analysed. There was not a clear relationship between the chemotype, based on the polyphenolic composition of the taxa, and their taxonomical classification. However, the composition of the methanolic and water extracts from the leaves of plants belonging to the Helianthemum genus was strongly related to their medicinal uses.
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether two antibacterial biflavonoids from Ochna pretoriensis (Ochnaceae).
AB  - The acetone extract of Ochna pretoriensis was evaluated for antibacterial activity using bioautography and serial microplate dilution methods against four nosocomial bacterial pathogens namely: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two antibacterial biflavonoids, ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the isolated compounds than the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC values: 31.3 microg/mL for P. aeruginosa and 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus). In addition, the isolated compounds were assessed for their potential toxic effects in the MTT toxicity assay using monkey kidney vero cells and Ames genotoxicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. LC50 values were 125.9 microg/mL for ochnaflavone and 162.0/microg/mL for ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. The isolated compounds have selectivity index values ranging from 1.29 to 4.03. Selectivity index values higher than one indicate that test samples are less toxic to the host cells than to the pathogens. The biflavonoids did not have any mutagenic effects in the Salmonella/microsome assay without metabolic activation.
TI  - Inactivation of pathogens in feces by desiccation and urea treatment for application in urine-diverting dry toilets.
AB  - Ecological sanitation technologies can be effective in providing health and environmental pollution control if they can efficiently reduce the pathogenicity of microorganisms carried in fecal material to safe levels. This study evaluated the sanitizing effects of different additives for dry treatment of feces from urine-diverting dry toilets, based on inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX, and Ascaris suum. The additives, ash (A) and oyster shell (O) in different amounts and urea (U) to optimize the process, were compared with no additive, solely urea, and sawdust as controls (C) and were covered ([x%O:A]) or uncovered (x%O:A). The main inactivation factors found were desiccation, ammonia content, and pH. S. Typhimurium and E. faecalis were more affected by the ammonia content. A combination of neutral to high pH and desiccation was most effective for inactivation of MS2, and desiccation was most effective for inactivation of PhiX and A. suum. The inactivation rate was modeled for all combinations studied. The most promising treatments were [150%O:A+U], 150%O:A+U, and 150%O:A. According to the models, these could inactivate, for example, 7 log(10) units of all bacteria and bacteriophages within 83, 125, and 183 days, respectively. The inactivation of A. suum was modeled, albeit the measured decay in egg viability was low.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - Purification and biochemical characterization of a highly thermostable bacteriocin isolated from Brevibacillus brevis strain GM100.
AB  - A bacteriocin-producing (11,000 AU mL(-1)) strain was isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy Algerian plants Ononis angustissima Lam., and identified as Brevibacillus brevis strain GM100. The bacteriocin, called Bac-GM100, was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant, and, based on MALDI-TOF/MS analysis, was a monomer protein with a molecular mass of 4375.66 Da. The 21 N-terminal residues of Bac-GM100 displayed 65% homology with thurincin H from Bacillus thuringiensis. Bac-GM100 was extremely heat-stable (20 min at 120 degrees C), and was stable within a pH range of 3-10. It proved sensitive to various proteases, which demonstrated its protein nature. It was also found to display a bactericidal mode of action against gram-negative (Salmonella enteric ATCC 43972, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58) and gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis ENSAIA 631 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538) bacteria, and a fungistatic mode of action against the pathogenic fungus Candida tropicalis R2 CIP 203.
TI  - Structural insight into the Clostridium difficile ethanolamine utilisation microcompartment.
AB  - Bacterial microcompartments form a protective proteinaceous barrier around metabolic enzymes that process unstable or toxic chemical intermediates. The genome of the virulent, multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile 630 strain contains an operon, eut, encoding a bacterial microcompartment with genes for the breakdown of ethanolamine and its utilisation as a source of reduced nitrogen and carbon. The C. difficile eut operon displays regulatory genetic elements and protein encoding regions in common with homologous loci found in the genomes of other bacteria, including the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica and Enterococcus faecalis. The crystal structures of two microcompartment shell proteins, CD1908 and CD1918, and an uncharacterised protein with potential enzymatic activity, CD1925, were determined by X-ray crystallography. CD1908 and CD1918 display the same protein fold, though the order of secondary structure elements is permuted in CD1908 and this protein displays an N-terminal beta-strand extension. These proteins form hexamers with molecules related by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. The structure of CD1925 has a cupin beta-barrel fold and a putative active site that is distinct from the metal-ion dependent catalytic cupins. Thin-section transmission electron microscopy of Escherichia coli over-expressing eut proteins indicates that CD1918 is capable of self-association into arrays, suggesting an organisational role for CD1918 in the formation of this microcompartment. The work presented provides the basis for further study of the architecture and function of the C. difficile eut microcompartment, its role in metabolism and the wider consequences of intestinal colonisation and virulence in this pathogen.
TI  - Triterpene saponins of Maesa lanceolata stem wood.
AB  - Phytochemical analysis of aqueous MeOH extract of Maesa lanceolata stem wood has  led to the isolation of four new triterpene saponins characterized as 16alpha,21beta-diacetoxy-22alpha-angeloyl-28-hydroxyolean-12-ene 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (1), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta-hydroxy-22alpha-angeloyl-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-alpha-arabinopyranoside (2), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta,22alpha-diangeloyl-13beta,28-epoxyoleanane 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-xylopyranoside (3), and 16alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (4), together with the known compounds beta-acetylamyrin, physcion, emodin, chrysophanol, ursolic acid, 16alpha-hydroxy-12-oleanene 3-O-glucoside, beta-amyrin, sitosterol 3-O-beta-glucoside, stigmasterol, and 3beta,28-dihydroxyolean-12-ene. Their structural elucidation was accomplished by homo- and heteronuclear 2D NMR technique as well as comparison with data from known compounds. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the aqueous MeOH extract was also investigated and zones of inhibition ranging from 32 +/- 1.1 to 14 +/- 0.2 mm were observed. Among the isolates, compound 1 was the most active with an minimum inhibitory concentration value of 25 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Lack of direct effects of agrochemicals on zoonotic pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria.
AB  - Agrochemicals, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and pathogens frequently contaminate water simultaneously. No significant direct effects of fertilizer, atrazine, malathion, and chlorothalonil on the survival of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, human polyomaviruses, and adenovirus were detected, supporting the assertion that previously observed effects of agrochemicals on FIB were indirect.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - The influences of natural zeolite (cliptinolite) on ammonia and biogenic amine formation by foodborne pathogen.
AB  - The influence of natural zeolite on biogenic amines (BAs) and ammonia (AMN) production by eight common gram negative and positive foodborne pathogens (FBP) were investigated in histidine decarboxylase broth (HDB). Presence of 1% zeolite in the HDB resulted in significantly higher AMN production. Histamine (HIS) production by gram positive bacteria was as low as 0.5 mg/L, whereas Escherichia coli produced 18.96 mg/L of HIS. The use of zeolite also significantly suppressed HIS accumulation by E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. paratyphi A (P < 0.05), although zeolite addition stimulated HIS production by K. pneumonia and Aeromonas hydrophila. The range of tyramine (TYR) production by gram positive bacteria was 1.19 and 4.06 mg/L for Enteroccus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes respectively. The results of study showed that the effect of zeolite on BAs and AMN production was dependent on bacterial strains, as well as zeolite concentrations used. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Natural zeolites are the main absorptive, low-cost material used in agriculture and industry. Although the effect of zeolite on ammonia formation in some industrial systems is well known, there is limited information regarding the impact of zeolite on biogenic amine (BA) production by foodborne pathogens. The data presented in this article will help us to understand the impact of natural zeolite on BA and ammonia production by eight common foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial and synergistic effects of silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil fungi of high altitudes of eastern himalaya.
AB  - Fifty three fungi isolated from soils of different microhabitats of eastern Himalayan range (3,400~3,600 msl) were screened for mycosynthesis of silver nanaoparticles (AgNPs) and their efficacy as antimicrobials were assessed in combination with commonly used antibiotics. Three isolates Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 identified based on morphological and 18S rRNA gene sequences were found to synthesize AgNPs. These nanoparticles were characterized by visual observation followed by UV-visible spectrophotometric analysis. The AgNPs synthesized by Aspergillus terreus SP5, Paecilomyces lilacinus SF1 and Fusarium sp. MP5 showed absorbance maxima at 412, 419, and 421 nm respectively in the visible region. Transmission electron microscopy micrograph showed formation of spherical AgNPs of 5~50 nm size. The antimicrobial activity of the mycosynthesized nanoparticles were investigated alone and in combination with commonly used antibiotics for analysis of growth inhibition zone against test organisms, namely, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC1925, Salmonella enterica MTCC735 and Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729. The mycosynthesized nanoparticles showed potent antibacterial activity and interestingly their syngergistic effect with erythromycin, methicillin, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin was significantly higher as compared to inhibitions by AgNPs alone. The present study indicates that silver nanoparticles synthesized using soil borne indigenous fungus of high altitudes show considerable antimicrobial activity, deserving further investigation for potential applications.
TI  - Activation of type III interferon genes by pathogenic bacteria in infected epithelial cells and mouse placenta.
AB  - Bacterial infections trigger the expression of type I and II interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type III interferon (IFN-lambda) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. Here, we studied the expression of IFN-lambda genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with Listeria monocytogenes. We first showed that in intestinal LoVo cells, induction of IFN-lambda genes by L. monocytogenes required bacterial entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. Other Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, also induced IFN-lambda genes when internalized by LoVo cells. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce IFN-lambda. We also found that IFN-lambda genes were up-regulated in A549 lung epithelial cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in HepG2 hepatocytes and BeWo trophoblastic cells infected with L. monocytogenes. In a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, IFN-lambda2/lambda3 mRNA levels were enhanced in placentas infected with L. monocytogenes. In addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to IFN-lambda2. Together, these results suggest that IFN-lambda may be an important modulator of the immune response to Gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.
TI  - Caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NCFM enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  - Although the immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved C. elegans host responses. We found that the probiotic Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is not harmful to C. elegans and that L. acidophilus NCFM is unable to colonize the C. elegans intestine. Conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent Enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic strains of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Preexposure of nematodes to Bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. Importantly, L. acidophilus NCFM activates key immune signaling pathways involved in C. elegans defenses against Gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via TIR-1 and PMK-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via BAR-1). Interestingly, conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM had a minimal effect on Gram-negative infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with Gram-negative pathogens or general stress. In conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with L. acidophilus NCFM modulates specific C. elegans immunity traits.
TI  - Iron availability increases the pathogenic potential of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens at the intestinal epithelial interface.
AB  - Recent trials have questioned the safety of untargeted oral iron supplementation  in developing regions. Excess of luminal iron could select for enteric pathogens at the expense of beneficial commensals in the human gut microflora, thereby increasing the incidence of infectious diseases. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of high iron availability on virulence traits of prevalent enteric pathogens at the host-microbe interface. A panel of enteric bacteria was cultured under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ferric citrate to assess the effect on bacterial growth, epithelial adhesion, invasion, translocation and epithelial damage in vitro. Translocation and epithelial integrity experiments were performed using a transwell system in which Caco-2 cells were allowed to differentiate to a tight epithelial monolayer mimicking the intestinal epithelial barrier. Growth of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens was increased in response to iron. Adhesion of S. typhimurium to epithelial cells markedly increased when these bacteria were pre-incubated with increasing iron concentration (P = 0.0001), whereas this was not the case for the non-pathogenic Lactobacillus plantarum (P = 0.42). Cellular invasion and epithelial translocation of S. typhimurium followed the trend of increased adhesion. Epithelial damage was increased upon incubation with S. typhimurium or Citrobacter freundii that were pre-incubated under iron-rich conditions. In conclusion, our data fit with the consensus that oral iron supplementation is not without risk as iron could, in addition to inducing pathogenic overgrowth, also increase the virulence of prevalent enteric pathogens.
TI  - Nanostructured silver vanadate as a promising antibacterial additive to water-based paints.
AB  - In this article, we report the use of nanostructured silver vanadate as a promising antibacterial additive to water-based paints that has potential for applications in bathrooms, kitchens, and hospital environments. This hybrid nanomaterial was prepared by a simple and fast precipitation reaction involving silver nitrate and ammonium vanadate, dismissing the hydrothermal treatment. The preparation involved using Ag vanadate nanowires (beta-AgVO(3)) with diameters ranging from 20 to 60 nm and decorated with silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters ranging from 5 to 40 nm. Results of antibacterial tests show that this hybrid material has a promising antibacterial activity against several types of bacteria strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. The evaluated material exhibits antibacterial activity 30 times larger than that of Oxacillin. In addition, this nanomaterial was tested as an antibacterial additive to water-based paints, and formulations with 1% show a 4-mm inhibition zone against a MRSA strain.
TI  - Fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
AB  - The EU Animal By-Products Regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. Bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. To address this, Salmonella enterica (serovars Senftenberg and Poona), Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of Escherichia coli O157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. Numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of E. coli O157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only E. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. Only very low numbers of Salmonella spp. and E. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. These results further indicate that bioreduction represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.
TI  - Composition and antibacterial activity of essential oil from Scutellaria grossa Wall ex Benth.
AB  - The chemical composition of the steam volatile oil of the whole aerial part of Scutellaria grossa Wall ex Benth. (Lamiaceae), obtained by steam distillation, has been analysed by capillary GC and GC-MS. The oil was found to be rich in oxygenated monoterpenes (88.6%). A total of 50 constituents were identified, representing 94.4% of the total oil composition. Linalool (37.0%) and 1-octen-3-ol (32.0%) were found to be the principal constituents. The antibacterial activity of the oil was determined against 10 bacterial strains by measuring the growth inhibitory zones. The oil showed significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and the Gram-negative, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica enterica. A minimum inhibitory concentration of 31.25 microL mL(-1) was observed against E. faecalis.
TI  - WFDC2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
AB  - WAP four disulfide core domain 2 (WFDC2) is a four disulfide core (4-DSC) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. It is comprised of two 4-DSC domains assigned domain III at the NH2-terminal end and domain II at the COOH-terminal end. The WFDC2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. The WFDC2 protein showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain II. There was no antibacterial activity detected against Enterococcus faecalis. The observed expression pattern of tammar WFDC2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by S. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. The latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as E. faecalis.
TI  - Acanthamoeba polyphaga, a potential environmental vector for the transmission of  food-borne and opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - The endosymbiotic relationship could represent for many bacteria an important condition favouring their spread in the environment and in foods. For this purpose we studied the behaviour of some food-borne and opportunistic pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterocolitica) when internalized in Acanthamoeba polyphaga. Our results confirm the capability of the bacteria tested to grow within amoebal hosts. We can observe two types of interactions of the bacteria internalized in A. polyphaga. The first type, showed by Y. enterocolitica and A. hydrophila, was characterized by an early replication, probably followed by the killing and digestion of the bacteria. The second type, showed by E. faecalis and S. aureus was characterized by the persistence and grow inside the host without lysis. Lastly, when amoebae were co-cultured with L. monocytogenes and S. Enteritidis, an eclipse phase followed by an active intracellular growth was observed, suggesting a third type of predator-prey trend. The extracellular count in presence of A. polyphaga, as a result of an intracellular multiplication and subsequent release, was characterized by an increase of E. faecalis, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes and S. Enteritidis, and by a low or absent cell count for Y. enterocolitica and A. hydrophila. Our study suggests that the investigated food-borne and opportunistic pathogens are, in most cases, able to interact with A. polyphaga, to intracellularly replicate and, lastly, to be potentially spread in the environment, underlining the possible role of this protozoan in food contamination.
TI  - Tammar wallaby mammary cathelicidins are differentially expressed during lactation and exhibit antimicrobial and cell proliferative activity.
AB  - Cathelicidins secreted in milk may be central to autocrine feedback in the mammary gland for optimal development in addition to conferring innate immunity to both the mammary gland and the neonate. This study exploits the unique reproductive strategy of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) model to analyse differential splicing of cathelicidin genes and to evaluate the bactericidal activity and effect of the protein on mammary epithelial cell proliferation. Two linear peptides, Con73 and Con218, derived from the heterogeneous carboxyl end of cathelicidin transcripts, MaeuCath1 and MaeuCath7 respectively, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. Both Con73 and Con218 significantly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella enterica. In addition both MaeuCath1 and MaeuCath7 stimulated proliferation of primary tammar wallaby mammary epithelial cells (WallMEC). Lactation-phase specific alternate spliced transcripts were determined for MaeuCath1 showing utilisation of both antimicrobial and proliferative functions are required by the mammary gland and the suckled young. The study has shown for the first time that temporal regulation of milk cathelicidins may be crucial in antimicrobial protection of the mammary gland and suckled young and mammary cell proliferation.
TI  - Evaluation of forty new phenothiazine derivatives for activity against intrinsic  efflux pump systems of reference Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because phenothiazines inhibit efflux pumps of bacteria, forty new phenothiazine derivatives were tested for their inhibition of the efflux pump systems of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detection of efflux pump activity was conducted by a previously described automated fluorimetric method. RESULTS: Although many of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux by distinct bacteria, four compounds had exceptional activity against the efflux pump systems of the pathogenic wild type bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. These four compounds were then evaluated for ability to reduce or reverse resistance of multi-drug resistant members of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus whose MDR phenotypes are mediated by specific over-expressed efflux pumps. One of the compounds, 2173, significantly reduced resistance of MDR Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest possible use of compound 2173 for therapy of infections caused by this organism.
TI  - Sensitivity to disinfection of bacterial indicator organisms for monitoring the Salmonella Enteritidis status of layer farms after cleaning and disinfection.
AB  - The present study evaluated Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae as potential indicator organisms for the possible Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) presence in layer farms after cleaning and disinfection by comparing their susceptibility to disinfection. A quantitative suspension disinfection test according to European Standard EN1656 was performed using disinfection products CID20 and Virocid (both from CID Lines, Ieper, Belgium). In a preliminary test, the sensitivity to both disinfection products was compared between ATCC strains of SE, E. coli, En. faecalis, and En. hirae. The sensitivity of SE to disinfection was most comparable to that of E. coli. A second disinfection test compared the elimination of E. coli to SE ATCC strains as well as field strains. Results showed no significant effect regarding the strain (P > 0.05 for CID20 and Virocid), meaning that no difference was detected in sensitivity toward disinfection. When comparing the sensitivity in general at species level for all concentrations of disinfectant used, no significant difference was found between E. coli and SE in sensitivity to Virocid (P > 0.05). In conclusion, because of its similar response to disinfection in a suspension disinfection test, E. coli could be used as an indicator for possible Salmonella presence after cleaning and disinfection.
TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - Treatment with Ca(OH)2 for inactivation of Salmonella Typhimurium and Enterococcus faecalis in soil contaminated with infected horse manure.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the inactivation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and the faecal indicator Enterococcus faecalis in horse manure:soil mixtures by application of hydrated lime (Ca(OH)(2)). METHODS AND RESULTS: In laboratory incubations, the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of Ca(OH)(2), as well as different application techniques, was tested. Other variables were horse manure:soil ratio, incubation temperature (6 and 14 degrees C) and soil type (sand/clay). Bacterial enumeration by the plate count method in samples taken at increasing intervals revealed that Ca(OH)(2) effectively reduced Salmonella Typhimurium numbers. However, to achieve a sufficient reduction, the Ca(OH)(2) had to be applied at a sufficient rate, and the amount required varied because of manure:soil ratio and incubation temperature. The results showed that a pH above 11 was needed and that a high pH had to be maintained for up to 7 days. An appropriate application technique for the Ca(OH)(2) was also important, so that a high pH was obtained throughout the whole material to be treated. In addition, a high manure:soil ratio in combination with a higher incubation temperature was found to rapidly neutralize the pH and to increase the risk of Salmonella re-growth. CONCLUSIONS: Application of Ca(OH)(2) can be an efficient method for treating a Salmonella-contaminated horse paddock. A high pH is a key factor in Salmonella inactivation, and thus, monitoring the pH during the treatment period is necessary. To avoid re-growth excess manure should be removed for separate treatment elsewhere. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Persistence of Salmonella in horse paddocks poses a risk of disease transmission to healthy animals and people who come into contact with these animals. An efficient method to de-contaminate a Salmonella-contaminated soil would be a valuable tool for animal welfare and for public health.
TI  - Disclosure of the quackery: testing of the bactericidal action of products based  on the "hydronic" technology ("informed glass") on ATCC strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and Candida albicans.
AB  - To disclose a quackery called "revitalisation of tired water by hydronic technology", scientific experiments have been conducted with drinking water kept in "ordinary, everyday-use" drinking glasses and so-called 'informed' glasses, a patent-protected product supposed to have an effect on the "structure, vitality and memory of water". Drinking "informed" water is claimed to have a wide range of positive revitalising health effects (blue informed glass), to facilitate weight loss (red informed glass) and to have a stress-relieving action (green informed glass). Allegedly, by the use of the "orgon methodology", information is coded into the glass, which action is additionally enforced by the addition of the "magic life" symbol - a specially designed energy condenser which, together with the selected information, is permanently introduced into the liquid contained in the glass. Since the manufacturer claimed the products to have a broad bactericidal action, regardless of the external conditions and completely independent from additional factor that would lead to the activation of the system, the efficacy of the informed drinking glass was tested using standardised, microbiological tests. Respecting the principle of a single-blind test for each of 5 samples of each type of the informed glass, growth reduction factor (RF) (difference log cfu/ml - colony per unit/ml of control glass and log cfu/ml of each informed glass) was determined after 0,2,4,6 and 8 h in spring water experimentally contaminated with standardised ATCC strains of two types of bacteria and one yeast. The results showed a statistically significant bactericidal action of the blue informed glass with all strains-Enterococcus faecalis (RF 0.62/0.76), Salmonella enteritidis (RF 0.87/0.97), and Candida albicans (RF 0.5/0.60) - as opposed to the red and green glasses where this effect was negligible (RF < 0.1). However, when the tests were repeated in complete darkness, none of the three informed glasses showed any bactericidal action. The obtained results indicate a fraud: bactericidal effect is rather a result of photocatalytic action of a hidden component used on purpose in the production of glass or subsequently applied by the use of nanotechnology (possibly antimony trioxide or titanium oxide) than of the so-called "orgon and hydronic technology".
TI  - Inhibition of efflux pumps in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis resistant strains by triterpenoids from Momordica balsamina.
AB  - Six cucurbitane-type triterpenoids (1-6) isolated from the aerial parts of Momordica balsamina were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) COL(OXA), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Salmonella enterica subsp. I serovar Typhimurium 5408 and S. Typhimurium 5408CIP strains. The latter strain overproduces the AcrB transporter of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump six-fold compared with its parent. Compounds 4-6 were also tested for similar activity against Escherichia coli AG100 wild-type strain and E. coli AG100TET8 that overproduces the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Evaluation of efflux activity was performed using a semi-automated method that measures accumulation of the universal efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Some of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux of EtBr by MRSA COL(OXA) and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. A correlation between activity and the topological polar surface area of the compounds was found for MRSA COL(OXA).
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and antimicrobial activity against medically important pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Biological reduction of aqueous silver ions by extracellular components of Streptomyces hygroscopicus has facilitated the development of industrially viable greener methods for the synthesis of technologically important silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The synthesized aqueous products showed the characteristic absorption spectra at 420 nm, which confirmed the presence of AgNPs. X-ray diffraction patterns displayed typical peaks of crystalline silver at approximately 38 degrees , approximately 45 degrees and approximately 65 degrees . The AgNPs were determined to be spherical (20-30 nm) with a purity of 70% as determined by FE-SEM, TEM, bio-AFM, XRD, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Furthermore, the biosynthesized AgNPs significantly inhibited the growth of medically important pathogenic gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and yeast (Candida albicans). Thus, bioconversion of silver nanoparticles by S. hygroscopicus could be employed as a potential nanomedicine to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities on foodborne pathogens of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) leaves extracts.
AB  - Total water extract, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions from the leaves of Artocarpus heterophyllus were evaluated for phenolic content, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities against some foodborne pathogens such as E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of extract and fractions determined by the agar dilution method were ranged from 221.9 microg/mL for ethyl acetate fraction to 488.1 microg/mL for total extract. In the agar diffusion method the diameters of inhibition were 12.2 for the total extract, 10.7 and 11.5 for ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions, respectively. A. heterophyllus showed significant antioxidant activity tested in different in vitro systems (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and Fe(2+) chelating activity assay). In particular, in DPPH assay A. heterophyllus total extract exhibited a strong antiradical activity with an IC(50) value of 73.5 microg/mL while aqueous fraction exerted the highest activity in FRAP assay (IC(50) value of 72.0 microg/mL). The total phenols content by Folin-Ciocalteau method was determined with the purpose of testing its relationship with the antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
TI  - A new antibacterial and antioxidant S07-2 compound produced by Bacillus subtilis  B38.
AB  - An antibacterial compound, S07-2, was purified to homogeneity by hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, C18 reverse-phase and HS PEG HPLC. The molecular mass of S07-2 was 905.6 Da as determined by MS. The S07-2 compound was resistant to high temperatures (up to 100 degrees C) and could withstand a wide range of pH from 3 to 10. In addition, its antibacterial activity was preserved after treatment with proteases. Biochemical characterization revealed its cyclic peptide structure. This compound showed a bactericidal effect against important food-spoilage bacteria and food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis with lethal concentration values of 62.5 microg mL(-1) and against Salmonella enteritidis at a concentration of 31.25 microg mL(-1). However, no cytotoxic effect against human erythrocytes was recorded. Furthermore, the S07-2 compound displayed a remarkable Fe(2+)-chelating activity (EC(50)=9.76 microg mL(-1)) and 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-scavenging capacity (IC(50)=65 microg mL(-1)). All these chemical and biological features make S07-2 a useful compound in the food industry as a natural preservative.
TI  - Diagnostic microarray for human and animal bacterial diseases and their virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes.
AB  - Rapid diagnosis and treatment of disease is often based on the identification and characterization of causative agents derived from phenotypic characteristics. Current methods can be laborious and time-consuming, often requiring many skilled personnel and a large amount of lab space. The objective of our study was to develop a spotted microarray for rapid identification and characterization of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance genes. Our spotted microarray consists of 489 70mer probes that detect 40 bacterial pathogens of medical, veterinary and zoonotic importance (including 15 NIAID Category A, B and C pathogens); associated genes that encode resistance for antimicrobial and metal resistance; and DNA elements that are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria. High specificity and reliability of the microarray was achieved for bacterial pathogens of animal and human importance by validating MDR pathogenic bacteria as pure cultures or by following their inoculation in complex and highly organic sample matrices, such as soil and manure.
TI  - Analysis of the variability in the number of viable bacteria after mild heat treatment of food.
AB  - Variability in the numbers of bacteria remaining in saline solution and whole milk following mild heat treatment has been studied with Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. As expected, the most heat-resistant bacterium was E. faecalis, while P. fluorescens was the least heat resistant, and all bacteria showed greater thermal resistance in whole milk than in saline solution. Despite the differences in the inactivation kinetics of these bacteria in different media, the variability in the final number of bacteria was affected neither by the species nor by the heating substrate, but it did depend on the intensity of the heat treatment. The more severe the heat treatment was, the lower the average number of surviving bacteria but the greater the variability. Our results indicated that the inactivation times for the cells within a population are not identically distributed random variables and that, therefore, the population includes subpopulations of cells with different distributions for the heat resistance parameters. A linear relationship between the variability of the log of the final bacterial concentration and the logarithmic reduction in the size of the bacterial population was found.
TI  - Transepithelial activation of human leukocytes by probiotics and commensal bacteria: role of Enterobacteriaceae-type endotoxin.
AB  - The goal of the current study was to clarify whether commercially available probiotics induce greater trans-epithelial activation of human leukocytes than do commensal, food-derived and pathogenic bacteria and to identify the compounds responsible for this activation. Eleven different bacterial strains, and some of their pathogen-associated molecular patterns, were incubated apically on a confluent layer of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2), which were basolaterally co-cultured with human mononuclear leukocytes. Only Gram-negative bacteria having Enterobacteriaceae-type endotoxin (commensal Escherichia coli K12, probiotic E. coli Nissle, EPEC) induced basolateral production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL 6, 8, and 10. Gram-positive probiotics (Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.) had virtually no effect. In addition, commensals (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides vulgatus) and food fermenters (Lactobacillus spp.) did not stimulate leukocytes transepithelially. Endotoxin from E. coli and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium induced comparable transepithelial stimulation of leukocytes, but not endotoxin from B. vulgatus or lipoteichoic acid from E. faecalis. Endotoxin-binding agents (polymyxin, colistin) completely abrogated transepithelial activation of leukocytes. Enterobacteriaceae-type endotoxin is a crucial factor in transepithelial stimulation of leukocytes, regardless of whether it is produced by probiotics or other bacteria. Hence, transepithelial stimulation ofleukocytes' innate immune response seems to not be linked to the health-promoting effects ofprobiotics.
TI  - Characterization of planktonic and biofilm communities of day-of-hatch chicks cecal microflora and their resistance to Salmonella colonization.
AB  - Recent concerns about the use of antimicrobials in food animals have increased interest in the microbial ecology and biofilms within their gastrointestinal tract. This work used a continuous-flow chemostat system to model the microbial community within the ceca from day-of-hatch chicks and its ability to resist colonization by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We characterized the biofilm and planktonic communities from five cultures by using automated ribotyping. Eight species from six different genera were identified. Overall, the planktonic communities were more diverse, with 40% of the cultures containing four or more bacterial species. Eighty percent of the biofilm communities contained only one or two species of bacteria. Enterococcus faecalis was the only species isolated from all communities. None of the resulting microbial communities was able to resist colonization by S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. This is the first study to provide a molecular-based characterization of the biofilm and planktonic communities found in day-of-hatch chicken cecal microflora cultures.
TI  - Survival of enteric bacteria and coliphage MS2 in pure human urine.
AB  - AIMS: The survival of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,  Enterococcus faecalis and coliphage MS2 was studied in stored, fresh and diluted (1 : 1) human urine at 15 and 30 degrees C. METHODS AND RESULTS: Survival rate was studied by the plate count method. All the organisms showed rapid inactivation in stored urine, but they survived better in diluted and fresh urine. The high pH level and temperature were the major factors found to influence the survival of the micro-organisms with the survival rate being higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: The destruction of all micro-organisms in stored urine required <1 week at 30 degrees C. Thus, the storage of urine is a useful way to reduce the risk of contamination while using urine as a fertilizer. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The urine fertilization is aimed for the developing countries and the high temperatures in these countries may hasten the destruction of micro-organisms in urine. On the contrary, a higher survival rate of these organisms in fresh and diluted urine is a public health concern because the dilution of urine with water is likely to happen during flushing.
TI  - Reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. Chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. This study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms, reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical disinfectants. METHODS: High concentrations of Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, MS2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and the endospores of Clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. Surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. Infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. RESULTS: A diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. Risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. CONCLUSIONS: The saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.
TI  - Enhanced bactericidal effect of enterocin AS-48 in combination with high-intensity pulsed-electric field treatment against Salmonella enterica in apple juice.
AB  - The effect of the broad spectrum cyclic antimicrobial peptide enterocin AS-48 combination with high-intensity pulsed-electric field (HIPEF) treatment (35 kV/cm, 150 Hz, 4 micros and bipolar mode) was tested on Salmonella enterica CECT 915 in apple juice. A response surface methodology was applied to study the bactericidal effects of the combined treatment. The process variables were AS-48 concentration, temperature, and HIPEF treatment time. While treatment with enterocin AS-48 alone up to 60 microg/ml had no effect on the viability of S. enterica in apple juice, an increased bactericidal activity was observed in combination with HIPEF treatments. Survival fraction was affected by treatment time, enterocin AS48 concentration and treatment temperature. The combination of 100 micros of HIPEF treatment, 30 microg/ml of AS-48, and temperature of 20 degrees C resulted in the lowest inactivation, with only a 1.2-log reduction. The maximum inactivation of 4.5-log cycles was achieved with HIPEF treatment for 1000 micros in combination with 60 microg/ml of AS-48 and a treatment temperature of 40 degrees C. Synergism between enterocin AS-48 and HIPEF treatment depended on the sequence order application, since it was observed only when HIPEF was applied in the presence of previously-added bacteriocin. The combined treatment could improve the safety of freshly-made apple juice against S. enterica transmission.
TI  - Innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by neurons expressing NPR-1/GPCR.
AB  - A large body of evidence indicates that metazoan innate immunity is regulated by  the nervous system, but the mechanisms involved in the process and the biological importance of such control remain unclear. We show that a neural circuit involving npr-1, which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) related to mammalian neuropeptide Y receptors, functions to suppress innate immune responses. The immune inhibitory function requires a guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-gated ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4 as well as the soluble guanylate cyclase GCY-35. Furthermore, we show that npr-1- and gcy-35-expressing sensory neurons actively suppress immune responses of nonneuronal tissues. A full-genome microarray analysis on animals with altered neural function due to mutation in npr-1 shows an enrichment in genes that are markers of innate immune responses, including those regulated by a conserved PMK-1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These results present evidence that neurons directly control innate immunity in C. elegans, suggesting that GPCRs may participate in neural circuits that receive inputs from either pathogens or infected sites and integrate them to coordinate appropriate immune responses.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria and viruses in human urine depending on temperature and  dilution rate.
AB  - Source separation and reuse of human urine can decrease the environmental pollution of recipient waters and reduce the need for artificial mineral fertilisers. However, the reuse of urine introduces another pathogen transmission route that needs to be managed. The inactivation of enteric pathogens and model organisms (Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Enterococcus faecalis, bacteriophages S. typhimurium 28B, MS2 and Phi x 174) by urine storage was studied at dilutions (urine:water) 1:0, 1:1 and 1:3 at temperatures 4, 14, 24 and 34 degrees C. A threshold concentration of ammonia was found at approximately 40 mM NH(3) (e.g. 2.1 g NH(3)-NL(-1) and pH 8.9 at 24 degrees C), below which all studied organisms, except Salmonella, persisted considerably longer irrespective of treatment temperature, showing that urine dilution rate is of great importance for pathogen inactivation. For Salmonella spp. no threshold level was found in these studies (15 mM NH(3) lowest concentration studied). At temperatures below 20 degrees C, bacteriophage reduction was very slow. Therefore, urine stored at temperatures below 20 degrees C carries a high risk of containing viable viruses. The study indicated that the current recommended storage time for urine of 6 months at 20 degrees C or higher is safe for unrestricted use and could probably be shortened, especially for undiluted urine.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin AS-48 for inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against Gram-negative bacteria. Although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on Salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at pH 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. Greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees C in an alkaline (pH 9.0) enterocin AS-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. Bactericidal activity against S. enterica increased greatly when enterocin AS-48 was used in washing solutions in combination with several chemical compounds: EDTA, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. The combined treatment of enterocin AS-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other Gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. The bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin AS-48 was confirmed in all cases. Combinations of enterocin AS-48 (25 microg/ml) and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of S. enterica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees C and 15 degrees C. The combined treatment could therefore be applied to reduce the risks of Gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.
TI  - Attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  - The broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (AM), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Salmonella enterica bacteria. These ePTFE surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (MA) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional NH 2/COOH-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The final step, the attachment of AM to the PEG spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between COOH-terminated PEG and NH 2 groups of AM. This approach protects the COOH-AM functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of AM. These studies also show that approximately 90% of AM molecules are still covalently attached to PEG-MA-ePTFE surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. Even after a 24 h period, the AM volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing AM-PEG-MA-ePTFE specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.
TI  - Interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with Acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  - Protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. Nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. We investigated the interactions of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with the amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. There was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. Intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that S. aureus survived and may even multiply within A. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of L. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.
TI  - In situ ammonia production as a sanitation agent during anaerobic digestion at mesophilic temperature.
AB  - AIM: To measure the sanitizing effect of mesophilic (37 degrees C) anaerobic digestion in high ammonia concentrations produced in situ. METHODS AND RESULTS: Indicator organisms and salmonella were transferred to small-scale anaerobic batch cultures and D-values were calculated. Batch cultures were started with material from two biogas processes operating at high (46 mmol l(-1)) and low (1.6 mmol l(-1)) ammonia concentration. D-values were shortened from c. 3 days to <1 day for the bacteria. MS2 had the same D-value (1.3 days) independent of ammonia concentration whereas PhiX174 and 28B were faster inactivated in the control (1.1 and 7.9 days) than in the high ammonia (8.9 and 39 days) batch cultures. CONCLUSION: Running biogas processes at high levels of ammonia shortens the time to meet EU regulation concerning reduction of salmonella and enterococci (5 log). Unless a minimum retention time of 2 days, post-treatment digestion is needed to achieve sufficient sanitation in continuous biogas processes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Running mesophilic biogas processes at high ammonia level produces residue with a high fertilizer value. With some stipulations concerning management parameters, such processes provide a method of bacterial sanitation without preceding pasteurization of the incoming organic waste.
TI  - Secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. Antibacterial protection is provided in part by Paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. The mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with Crohn's ileitis. In the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying mucus and the luminal content. METHODS: Preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. RESULTS: The secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. The extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for Listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); Enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); Bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); Streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); Escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). A spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. CONCLUSION: These findings show that secreted antimicrobial peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. This distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.
TI  - Role of enteric fever in ileal perforations: an overstated problem in tropics?
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the role of enteric fever in ileal perforations. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 47 patients of ileal perforation was subjected to clinical examination and investigations for APACHE II scoring. Blood, ulcer edge biopsy, mesenteric lymph node and peritoneal aspirate were subjected to culture to determine the predominant aerobic bacterial isolate and its antibiogram. RESULTS: Seven patients (14.9%) required intensive care and seven (14.9%) developed septicaemia. Mortality was 17%. Highest isolation rate was seen in ulcer edge (70.2%) followed by lymph node (66%) culture. The bacterial spectrum was Escherichia coli (23.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (21.3%), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (6.3%), Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A (4.2%), etc. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric fever organisms are not the predominant causative agents of ileal perforations. Culture of ulcer edge biopsy, lymph node is crucial for aetiological diagnosis. The use of APACHE II triaging and prescription of antimicrobials based on the local pattern of susceptibility profile of the aetiological agent is recommended.
TI  - Survival of enteric microorganisms on grass surfaces irrigated with treated effluent.
AB  - Treated effluent can be reused for the irrigation of parks and sports grounds but there is an associated potential public health risks from microbial pathogens present on the grass surface, particularly when used for contact sports. The main aim of this study was to investigate the survival of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms on the grass surface of a sports ground irrigated with treated effluent under differing climatic conditions. Results showed that Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus decayed faster under direct sunlight than MS2 with one log(10) reduction (T(90)) varying from 3 to 11 hours. Rapid decay (T(90) 3 to 4 hours) of bacterial pathogens occurred in both sunlight and shade during the summer. In contrast, T(90) times for the bacteria during the winter varied from 6 to 11 hours in direct sunlight and from 23 to 38 hours in shade. No significant seasonal variation was observed in the inactivation of the bacteriophage MS2. Enteric viruses are expected to show inactivation rates similar to MS2. The results show that rapid inactivation of enteric bacteria can be expected on grass surface irrigated with treated effluent at higher ambient temperatures, in direct sunlight and low moisture content.
TI  - Comparative study of leaf and stem bark extracts of Parkia biglobosa against enterobacteria.
AB  - Hydroethanolic and aqueous extracts of leaf and stem bark of Parkia biglobosa (Jacq) Benth. (Mimosaceae) were tested against clinical isolates Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Enterococcus faecalis, and corresponding collection strains E. coli CIP 105 182, Salmonella enterica CIP 105 150, Shigella dysenteriae CIP 54-51 and Enterococcus faecalis CIP 103 907. Discs of Gentamicin, a broad spectrum antibiotic were used as positive controls. The results showed that all the extracts possess antimicrobial activities. A comparative study of the antibacterial activity of the leaves and that of the bark showed that for all the tested microorganisms, the hydroalcoholic extract of the bark is more active than the aqueous extract of the leaf. The hydroethanolic extract of the leaves is as effective as the aqueous extract of the stem bark prescribed by the traditional healer, suggesting it is possible to use leaves other than the roots and bark. The phytochemical screening showed that sterols and triterpenes, saponosides, tannins, reducing compounds, coumarins, anthocyanosides, flavonosides are present in both bark and leaf but in different concentrations.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Reduction of bacteria on spinach, lettuce, and surfaces in food service areas using neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water.
AB  - Food safety issues and increases in food borne illnesses have promulgated the development of new sanitation methods to eliminate pathogenic organisms on foods and surfaces in food service areas. Electrolyzed oxidizing water (EO water) shows promise as an environmentally friendly broad spectrum microbial decontamination agent. EO water is generated by the passage of a dilute salt solution ( approximately 1% NaCl) through an electrochemical cell. This electrolytic process converts chloride ions and water molecules into chlorine oxidants (Cl(2), HOCl/ClO(-)). At a near-neutral pH (pH 6.3-6.5), the predominant chemical species is the highly biocidal hypochlorous acid species (HOCl) with the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of the solution ranging from 800 to 900mV. The biocidal activity of near-neutral EO water was evaluated at 25 degrees C using pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment of these organisms, in pure culture, with EO water at concentrations of 20, 50, 100, and 120ppm total residual chlorine (TRC) and 10min of contact time resulted in 100% inactivation of all five organisms (reduction of 6.1-6.7log(10)CFU/mL). Spray treatment of surfaces in food service areas with EO water containing 278-310ppm TRC (pH 6.38) resulted in a 79-100% reduction of microbial growth. Dip (10min) treatment of spinach at 100 and 120ppm TRC resulted in a 4.0-5.0log(10)CFU/mL reduction of bacterial counts for all organisms tested. Dipping (10min) of lettuce at 100 and 120ppm TRC reduced bacterial counts of E. coli by 0.24-0.25log(10)CFU/mL and reduced all other organisms by 2.43-3.81log(10)CFU/mL.
TI  - New signaling molecules in some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A new family of putative signaling molecules having a 2(5H)-furanone configuration has been described in this work. They were released during late exponential or stationary phase in different growth media by some gram-positive bacteria, such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Enterococcus faecalis, and a gram-negative species, i.e. Salmonella enterica. A pair of 2(5H)-furanones called furanones A and B occurred in all the conditioned media (CMs) of the species considered. These two molecules showed similar retention times and their spectral data shared the key fragments to include them in the 2(5H)-furanones family. However, some differences were observed in the mass fragmentation profiles. In particular the use of PCA analysis of all the mass fragments enabled the grouping of furanone A profiles of S. enterica, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. paraplantarum, L. sanfranciscensis and E. faecalis in one unique cluster with only few exceptions. On the other hand, the mass fragmentation profiles of furanone B of the major part of the species and strains could be grouped together and were differentiated from those of L. helveticus. The specific activity of cell-free supernatants of high density cultures of S. enterica confirmed that the release of active molecules, and specifically of furanones A and B, was cell density dependent. Moreover, a preliminary experiment suspending S. enterica cells into cell-free supernatants of L. helveticus previously exposed to an oxidative stress demonstrated that furanones A and B have a strong interspecific activity. In fact cell autolysis and cell envelope damages were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in S. enterica.
TI  - Assessment and interpretation of bacterial viability by using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Kit in combination with flow cytometry.
AB  - The commercially available LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit is enjoying increased popularity among researchers in various fields of microbiology. Its use in combination with flow cytometry brought up new questions about how to interpret LIVE/DEAD staining results. Intermediate states, normally difficult to detect with epifluorescence microscopy, are a common phenomenon when the assay is used in flow cytometry and still lack rationale. It is shown here that the application of propidium iodide in combination with a green fluorescent total nucleic acid stain on UVA-irradiated cells of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and a community of freshwater bacteria resulted in a clear and distinctive flow cytometric staining pattern. In the gram-negative bacterium E. coli as well as in the two enteric pathogens, the pattern can be related to the presence of intermediate cellular states characterized by the degree of damage afflicted specifically on the bacterial outer membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that EDTA-treated nonirradiated cells exhibit the same staining properties. On the contrary, this pattern was not observed in gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, which lacks an outer membrane. Our observations add a new aspect to the LIVE/DEAD stain, which so far was believed to be dependent only on cytoplasmic membrane permeability.
TI  - Glicentin inhibits internalization of enteric bacteria by cultured INT-407 enterocytes.
AB  - Glicentin, the main component of enteroglucagon, has trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. It may also have an inhibitory effect on extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria. We have established an in vitro bioassay system for determining the effects of recombinant human glicentin on bacterial internalization by confluent enterocytes. An INT-407 cell line was serum-deprived for 2 days and was then treated on transwell filters for 24 h with a medium containing one of the following: glicentin 100 ng-1 microg/ml, glucagons-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) 1 microg/ml, 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS), or without any growth factors. Pure cultures of Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis were introduced to the upper chambers of the filter units. Following 2 h of incubation the numbers of bacteria in the lower chambers were measured. Pretreatment of enterocytes with glicentin inhibited bacterial internalization compared to untreated or GLP-2 enterocytes. Glicentin was associated with inhibition of enterocyte internalization of enteric bacteria by a mechanism that might be related to the integrity of the enterocyte adhesive junctions and tight junctions and to the production of sIgA. Glicentin seems to have a function as a barrier-sustaining agent that inhibits extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria.
TI  - GATA transcription factor required for immunity to bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - In the past decade, Caenorhabditis elegans has been used to dissect several genetic pathways involved in immunity; however, little is known about transcription factors that regulate the expression of immune effectors. C. elegans does not appear to have a functional homolog of the key immune transcription factor NF-kappaB. Here we show that that the intestinal GATA transcription factor ELT-2 is required for both immunity to Salmonella enterica and expression of a C-type lectin gene, clec-67, which is expressed in the intestinal cells and is a good marker of S. enterica infection. We also found that ELT-2 is required for immunity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Lack of immune inhibition by DAF-2, which negatively regulates the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, rescues the hypersusceptibility to pathogens phenotype of elt-2(RNAi) animals. Our results indicate that ELT-2 is part of a multi-pathogen defense pathway that regulates innate immunity independently of the DAF-2/DAF-16 signaling pathway.
TI  - Biofilm-associated proteins.
AB  - Although exopolysaccharides are important and often essential compounds of the biofilm matrix, recent evidences suggest that a group of surface proteins plays a leading role during the development of the microbial communities. The first member of this group of proteins was described in a Staphylococcus aureus bovine mastitis isolate and was named Bap, for biofilm-associated protein. Later on, other surface proteins homologous to Bap and involved in biofilm development have been described in many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In this review, we have summarized our knowledge about three members of this group of proteins: Bap of S. aureus, Esp of Enterococcus faecalis and BapA of Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis.
TI  - Effects of the bacteriocin PsVP-10 produced by Pseudomonas sp. on sensitive bacterial strains.
AB  - The bacteriocin PsVP-10 is a 2.6 Kda peptide which was isolated and purified from Pseudomonas sp. This bacteriocin possesses lethal activity over Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri. The experimental assays showed that the bacteriocin is able to be adsorbed by all cells of these bacterial species and also by their isolated cell walls. It was observed that the resistant mutants and their respective cell walls are unable to adsorb the bacteriocin. Assays performed with spheroplasts obtained from sensitive bacterial species and their resistant mutants show a rapid lethal effect of the bacteriocin PsVP-10. This results indicated furthermore, it is also shown that the optimal pH and temperature for the adsorption were 7.2 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The study carried out with organic solvents like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the detergents sodium dodecyl sulfate and triton X-100 showed a moderate inhibition of the bacteriocin lethal action for the Gram negative cells. The enzymes lysozime, protease XIV and trypsine type III-S did not present any effect over the adsorption capacity of the bacteriocin with any of the bacterial species studied.
TI  - Activity of Brassica oleracea leaf juice on foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Many vegetables of the Cruciferae family have been found to possess antimicrobial properties against several microorganisms of clinical importance. In this study, we reported the antibacterial effect of Brassica oleracea juice on several food-borne pathogens. The juice was found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis, verotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157:H7, E. coli HB producing thermolabile toxin, nontoxigenic E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes, but not Enterococcus faecalis. All cauliflower cultivars tested suppressed bacterial growth in a dose-dependent manner after 5 h of treatments, and the reduction in the number of viable cells ranged from 1 log with a 10% juice concentration to more than 3 log with a 20% juice concentration. The foodborne bacteria tested were also markedly reduced by isothiocyanates, natural components abundant in the genus Brassica, indicating that glucosinolate-derived isothiocyanates can play a major role in the antimicrobial activity of cauliflower. The antimicrobial effect of juice was reduced in presence of cysteine, suggesting that one mechanism of action of the juice involves blocking bacterial sulfhydryl groups.
TI  - Comparison of composting, storage and urea treatment for sanitising of faecal matter and manure.
AB  - To close the loop of nutrients in a safe way, the loop of pathogens has to be broken. By sanitising organic fertilisers derived from faeces and manure, the first step in the disease transmission chain is broken. Two alternatives for this treatment, thermophilic composting and ammonia-based treatment, were evaluated and compared to storage treatment. Thermal composting of faecal matter and food waste resulted in a treatment temperature of over 65 degrees C in a 90 L reactor. By using insulation and turning the compost three times during the high temperature period, it is possible to ensure a 5 log(10) reduction of pathogens. Small scale composting of the same material indicated less efficient reduction of faecal bacteria at temperatures around 50 degrees C. In the chemical treatment tested, an addition of 3% N-NH(3) increased the pH to above 9 within 1h and resulted in a good reduction in the indicator organisms for bacteria (Salmonella spp. and faecal coliforms D(r)<0.7 days, Enterococcus spp. D(r)<3 days). Lower addition rates resulted in a longer treatment period needed. The storage period tested resulted in slow reduction of faecal coliforms, Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Heat-shock transcription factor (HSF)-1 pathway required for Caenorhabditis elegans immunity.
AB  - Innate immunity comprises physical barriers, pattern-recognition receptors, antimicrobial substances, phagocytosis, and fever. Here we report that increased temperature results in the activation of a conserved pathway involving the heat-shock (HS) transcription factor (HSF)-1 that enhances immunity in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans. The HSF-1 defense response is independent of the p38 MAPK/PMK-1 pathway and requires a system of chaperones including small and 90-kDa inducible HS proteins. In addition, HSF-1 is needed for the effects of the DAF-2 insulin-like pathway in defense to pathogens, indicating that interacting pathways control stress response, aging, and immunity. The results also show that HSF-1 is required for C. elegans immunity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pestis, and Enterococcus faecalis, indicating that HSF-1 is part of a multipathogen defense pathway. Considering that several coinducers of HSF-1 are currently in clinical trials, this work opens the possibility that activation of HSF-1 could be used to boost immunity to treat infectious diseases and immunodeficiencies.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Chlorine residual efficiency in inactivating bacteria from secondary contamination in Isfahan, 2002.
AB  - To investigate the inactivation of potential pathogens, we evaluated survival rates for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila and Salmonella typhi in samples taken from the Isfahan drinking water system. Chlorine residual, pH, temperature and total organic carbon levels were measured. The organism most sensitive to chlorine was A. hydrophila. It was inactived in < 100 minutes at chlorine levels of 0.11 mg/L to 0.90 mg/L. The other 3 organisms showed higher resistance. E. coli tolerated 0.30 mg/L chlorine for > 1000 minutes while Ent. faecalis and S. typhi survived at total chlorine concentration of 0.50 mg/L for 100 minutes. We concluded that total chlorine levels of less than 0.71 mg/L in water supply systems cannot provide the recommended safety levels.
TI  - Development of a rapid method for simultaneous recovery of diverse microbes in drinking water by ultrafiltration with sodium polyphosphate and surfactants.
AB  - The ability to simultaneously concentrate diverse microbes is an important consideration for sample collection methods that are used for emergency response and environmental monitoring when drinking water may be contaminated with an array of unknown microbes. This study focused on developing a concentration method using ultrafilters and different combinations of a chemical dispersant (sodium polyphosphate [NaPP]) and surfactants. Tap water samples were seeded with bacteriophage MS2, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, 4.5-microm microspheres, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Bacillus globigii endospores, and echovirus 1. Ten-liter tap water samples were concentrated to approximately 250 ml in 12 to 42 min, depending on the experimental condition. Initial experiments indicated that pretreating filters with fetal bovine serum or NaPP resulted in an increase in microbe recovery. The addition of NaPP to the tap water samples resulted in significantly higher microbe and microsphere recovery efficiencies. Backflushing of the ultrafilter was found to significantly improve recovery efficiencies. The effectiveness of backflushing was improved further with the addition of Tween 80 to the backflush solution. The ultrafiltration method developed in this study, incorporating the use of NaPP pretreatment and surfactant solution backflushing, was found to recover MS2, C. parvum, microspheres, and several bacterial species with mean recovery efficiencies of 70 to 93%. The mean recovery efficiency for echovirus 1 (49%) was the lowest of the microbes studied for this method. This research demonstrates that ultrafiltration can be effective for recovering diverse microbes simultaneously in tap water and that chemical dispersants and surfactants can be beneficial for improving microbial recovery using this technique.
TI  - Peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. We used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive NTHi strain R2866 (also called Int1). Over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward R2866 in a dose-dependent manner. Five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (KQRTSIRATEGCLPS; clone hi3/17), while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. All of the bactericidal phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. Clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of clinical NTHi isolates and H. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica) bacteria. These data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.
TI  - Assessment of the effects of Nurmi-type cultures and a defined probiotic preparation on a Salmonella typhimurium 29E challenge in vivo.
AB  - The effects of treatment with an undefined commercial Nurmi-type culture (NTC), cultured cecal contents, and a dual-strain probiotic, containing Enterococcus faecalis and Pediococcus pentosaceus, on Salmonella Typhimurium colonization were evaluated in a specific-pathogen-free bird model. Two sets of trials were performed, and each study was arranged as a randomized complete block design with three treatments. Treatments consisted of (i) control, (ii) commercial NTC, and (iii) cultured cecal contents in the first set of trials and (i) control, (ii) defined probiotic, and (iii) cultured cecal contents in the second set. On day 1, birds were administered 1.2 x 10(7) CFU of the appropriate treatment by oral gavage. On day 3, all birds were challenged with 1 x 10(6) CFU of Salmonella Typhimurium 29E (nalidixic acid resistant). Chicks were asphyxiated with argon gas on day 10, and ceca were aseptically removed. Salmonella Typhimurium counts (CFU per milliliter of cecal contents) were determined on brilliant green agar containing 30 mg of nalidixic acid per liter, and CFU counts were log transformed prior to analysis. Cecal pH and volatile fatty acid concentrations were also determined. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and means were compared by Tukey's pairwise analysis. Commercial NTC and cultured cecal contents treatments resulted in a significant decrease (P < or = 0.05) in Salmonella Typhimurium 29E colonization, with the NTC offering a higher level of protection. In the second set of trials, the defined probiotic tended to reduce colonization by Salmonella Typhimurium (P = 0.07), while chicks treated with cultured cecal contents displayed a significant decrease (P = 0.03) when compared to the negative control. No significant change was observed in cecal pH or in acetate and propionate concentrations; however, a significant increase in butyrate concentrations in both the cultured cecal contents and defined probiotic treatment groups was observed when compared to the control birds. These observations suggest that defined cultures are less effective Salmonella control agents than are preparations generated from the complete cecal microflora.
TI  - Inactivation of enteric microorganisms with chemical disinfectants, UV irradiation and combined chemical/UV treatments.
AB  - The relative disinfection efficiencies of peracetic acid (PAA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and coliphage MS2 virus were studied in laboratory-scale experiments. This study also evaluated the efficiency of combined PAA/ultraviolet irradiation (UV) and H2O2/UV treatments to determine if the microbial inactivation was synergistic. Microbial cultures were added into a synthetic wastewater-like test medium and treated by chemical disinfectants with a 10 min contact time, UV irradiation or the combination of chemical and UV treatments. A peracetic acid dose of 3 mg/l resulted in approximately 2-3 log enteric bacterial reductions, whereas 7-15 mg/l PAA was needed to achieve 1-1.5 log coliphage MS2 reductions. Doses of 3-150 mg/l hydrogen peroxide achieved below 0.2 log microbial reductions. Sodium hypochlorite treatments caused 0.3-1 log microbial reductions at an 18 mg/l chlorine dose, while 2.6 log reductions of E. faecalis were achieved at a 12 mg/l chlorine dose. The results indicate that PAA could represent a good alternative to chlorine compounds in disinfection procedures, especially in wastewaters containing easily oxidizable organic matter. Hydrogen peroxide is not an efficient disinfectant against enteric microorganisms in wastewaters. The combined PAA/UV disinfection showed increased disinfection efficiency and synergistic benefits with all the enteric bacteria tested but lower synergies for the coliphage MS2. This suggests that this method could improve the efficiency and reliability of disinfection in wastewater treatment plants. The combined H2O2/UV disinfection only slightly influenced the microbial reductions compared to UV treatments and showed some antagonism and no synergies.
TI  - Effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig.
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pigs (treated with avilamycin for 3 months and controls) were challenged with multi-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and faecal counts were performed for enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium and Campylobacter (before, during and 5 weeks post-treatment). Representative isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. Avilamycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis (speciated by PCR) were isolated from the treated pigs and continued to be detected for the first week after treatment had ceased. The avilamycin-resistance gene was characterized by PCR as the emtA gene and speciation by PCR. MIC profiling confirmed that more than one strain of Ent. faecalis carried this gene. There was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in the E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter populations, although there was a higher incidence of tetB positive E. coli in the treated pigs than the controls. CONCLUSION: Although avilamycin selects for resistance in the native enterococci population of the pig, no resistant isolates were detected beyond 1 week post-treatment. This suggests that resistant isolates were unable to persist once selective pressure was removed and were out-competed by the sensitive microflora. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data suggest the risk of resistant isolates becoming carcass contaminants and infecting humans could be minimized by introducing a withdrawal period after using avilamycin and prior to slaughter.
TI  - Surface disinfection tests with Salmonella and a putative indicator bacterium, mimicking worst-case scenarios in poultry houses.
AB  - Surface disinfection studies mimicking worst-case scenarios in badly cleaned poultry houses were made with 3 bacterial isolates (Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella senftenberg, and Enterococcus faecalis), and 3 1% disinfectant solutions, formaldehyde (F; 24.5% vol/vol), glutaraldehyde/benzalkonium chloride (G; Bio Komplet Plus), and a peroxygen compound (P; Virkon S), with World Health Organization (WHO) standard hard water as a control. Materials (concrete paving stones, steel feed chain links, wooden dowels, and jute egg belts) and organic matter found commonly in poultry houses (feed, fats, egg yolk) were used in the tests. Organic matter inoculated with high numbers of stationary phase cultures was added to materials and dried for 24 h at different temperatures (6, 11, 20, or 30 degrees C), immersed in solutions for set time periods (5, 15, or 30 min), and dried again for 25 h (6, 11, or 30 degrees C). Then, traditional recovery procedures (using 10-fold dilutions until 10(-4), i.e., a most probable number method) were applied. For the 2 Salmonella isolates, the efficacy of the solutions was (in decreasing order): formaldehyde > glutaraldehyde/benzalkonium chloride > peroxygen compound > WHO hard water, except when feed chain links with fats were disinfected using 30 degrees C before and after disinfection, for which the peroxygen compound seemed more effective. Enterococcus faecalis was equally or less susceptible than S. enteritidis and S. senftenberg, indicating its suitability as an indicator bacterium. For the peroxygen compound, S. senftenberg was more susceptible than S. enteritidis in spite of higher minimum inhibitory concentrations to this disinfectant for the former.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of 2-nitropropanol against select food-borne pathogens in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: To test the inhibitory activity of 2-nitro-1-propanol (2NPOH) against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Enterococcus faecalis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific growth rates (h(-1)) of S. Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and Ent. faecalis were determined during culture in tryptic soya broth (TSB) supplemented with 0-10 mm 2NPOH. Growth rates were inhibited by 2NPOH, with nearly complete inhibition observed with 10 mm. Studies with S. Typhimurium revealed that its survivability during culture in TSB containing 5 or 10 mm 2NPOH was lower (P < 0.05) under aerobic than anaerobic conditions. The survivability of Salmonella during anaerobic culture in TSB containing 2.5 mm 2NPOH was less at pH 5.6 than at pH 7.0 and 8.0. No Salmonella survived anaerobic incubation in TSB supplemented with 10 mm 2NPOH regardless of pH. When incubated in suspensions of freshly collected populations of ruminal and faecal bacteria, Salmonella concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in suspensions containing 10 mm 2NPOH than in suspensions containing no 2NPOH. CONCLUSIONS: 2NPOH inhibited S. Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and Ent. faecalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest that 2NPOH may be a useful antimicrobial supplement to reduce carriage of certain food-borne pathogens in food animals.
TI  - The art of serendipity: killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by human pathogens as a model of bacterial and fungal pathogenesis.
AB  - The nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been used to develop a facile model system of host-pathogen interactions to identify basic evolutionarily conserved pathways associated with microbial pathogenesis. The model involves the killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by a variety of human pathogens. Several virulence-related genes in a variety of pathogens previously shown to be involved in mammalian infection have also been shown to play a role in Caenorhabditis elegans killing. Screening of large numbers of microbial mutants for attenuation in a mammalian model would require thousands of mice, rats or rabbits. In contrast, the Caenorhabditis elegans model allows rapid identification of mutants in microbial genes associated with pathogenesis and then these phenotypes can be confirmed in a relevant mammalian model.
TI  - Premature Salmonella Typhimurium growth inhibition in competition with other Gram-negative organisms is redox potential regulated via RpoS induction.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the role of oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in the premature growth inhibition and RpoS induction in Salmonella serotype Typhimurium in competitive growth experiments. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oxidation-reduction potential was measured throughout the growth of a minority population of Salm. Typhimurium in mixed cultures with other Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. A lux-based reporter was also used to evaluate RpoS activity in Salm. Typhimurium in competitor studies. In a mixed culture, the multiplication of a minority population of Salm. Typhimurium was inhibited when competing Gram-negative organisms entered the stationary phase. This was not seen when the competing flora was Gram-positive. The change in redox potential during growth in mixed cultures was closely linked to the inhibition of Salm. Typhimurium growth by Gram-negative competitors. An artificially induced drop in redox potential earlier during growth in mixed cultures with Gram-negative organisms reduced the time to RpoS induction in Salm. Typhimurium and thus inhibited its multiplication prematurely. In contrast, RpoS induction and growth inhibition were prevented under high redox potential conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that the inhibitory activity of competitive organisms can be mediated through their effect on redox potential-regulated RpoS induction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Redox potential is shown to be an important determinant of Salm. Typhimurium growth, an observation with practical implications both for its control and detection.
TI  - Detection of low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  - Biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. An antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. The principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture Listeria cells on the fiber. Capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, C11E9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by launching a 635-nm laser light from an Analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. This immunosensor was specific for L. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other Listeria species or other microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Lactobacillus plantarum, Carnobacterium gallinarum, Hafnia alvei, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. Fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. The sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) CFU/ml for a pure culture of L. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees C. When L. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees C with 3.5% NaCl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively. In less than 24 h, this method could detect L. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 CFU/g after enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth.
TI  - Relationship between antibacterial activity of chitosan and surface characteristics of cell wall.
AB  - AIM: Five representative waterborne pathogens were used to illustrate the relationship between chitosan's antibacterial activity and the surface characteristics of the bacterial cell wall. METHODS: Chitosan was prepared with averaged 75% or 95% deacetylated degree to examine its antibacterial activity against waterborne pathogens. Fresh microbial inoculants for the antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient agar at 37 degrees for 24 h. The evaluation items of antibacterial mechanism included hydrophilicity and negative charge analysis of cell surface, and adsorptive characteristics of chitosan to bacterial cell. All the experiments were applied in triplicate tests at least. RESULTS: Although cell wall hydrophilicity was similar among Gram-negative bacteria, the distribution of negative charge on their cell surfaces was quite different. More negatively charged cell surfaces had a greater interaction with chitosan, a phenomenon further confirmed by transmission electron micrography (TEM). CONCLUSION: Results showed the hydrophilicity in Gram-negative bacteria was much higher than in Gram-positive ones. The correlation coefficient 0.988 between the amount of absorbed chitosan and its inhibition efficiency indicated a close relationship.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries.
AB  - A total of 100 bacterial strains (25 Escherichia coli, 25 Salmonella enterica, 25 Staphylococcus aureus, and 25 Enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries using routine methodology. In addition, the 25 Enterococcus strains were identified to species level. A total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. When the reported results were categorized according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. For E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for Enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. Susceptibility testing of Salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of S. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. Ten laboratories identified the Enterococcus spp. to species level. All five Enterococcus faecium and 10 Enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the Danish Veterinary Institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. This study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella from animals in the Nordic countries are comparable. But it also showed that some aspects can be improved. In addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - The World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System Proficiency Testing Program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using NCCLS methods.
AB  - A total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the NCCLS testing procedures participated in the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EQAS-AST) from January 1998 through March 2001. Laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Ga. The results were compared to the results generated at the CDC with the NCCLS broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. Although there were few testing errors with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of Salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136 (91%) of 150 laboratories. In addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the Staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. For a vanB-containing Enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference MIC or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. Of the laboratories that tested Streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. While 110 laboratories (73%) tested the S. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no NCCLS interpretive criteria. Ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an MIC method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. Feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. The positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the EQAS program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. The 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.
TI  - Human beta-defensin-2 induction in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosal tissues: antimicrobial effect of overexpression.
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand more of the innate immune response  to Helicobacter pylori by determining the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) in various gastric mucosal tissues and MKN45 gastric cancer cells with or without H. pylori. Semi-quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out. The antimicrobial effects of a transfected hBD-2 gene against H. pylori were also evaluated. The results showed that hBD-2 was expressed in inflamed gastric mucosal tissues with H. pylori infection, but not in the absence of H. pylori infection. Expression was also detected in gastric cancers in patients with H. pylori infection. Expression was induced in the MKN45 gastric cancer cell line by H. pylori in a manner dependent on the abundance of bacteria. hBD-2-transfected 3T3J2-1 cells secreted hBD-2 protein into the culture medium and this protein inhibited growth of H. pylori completely. The results suggest that hBD-2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of H. pylori-induced gastritis.
TI  - Interactive inhibition of meat spoilage and pathogenic bacteria by lysozyme, nisin and EDTA in the presence of nitrite and sodium chloride at 24 degrees C.
AB  - To develop a nisin- and lysozyme-based antimicrobial treatment for use with processed ham and bologna, in vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether inhibition enhancing interactions occur between the antimicrobials lysozyme, chrisin (a commercial nisin preparation), EDTA, NaCl and NaNO(2). Inhibitory interactions were observed between a number of agents when used against specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. The observed interactions included lysozyme with EDTA (Enterococcus faecalis and Weissella viridescens), chrisin with EDTA (all Gram-positive organisms), EDTA with NaCl (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia grimesii), EDTA with nitrite (E. coli, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium), chrisin with nitrite (Lc. mesenteroides, L. monocytogenes), and NaCl with nitrite (S. Typhimurium, Shewanella putrefaciens). Previous reports have described interactions between nisin with EDTA that resulted in enhanced antimicrobial effect against Gram-negative bacteria, or lysozyme with nisin against Gram-positive bacteria. These interactions were not observed in these experiments. We observed that unlike previous studies, these experiments were conducted on growing cells in nutrient broth, rather than under conditions of nutrient limitation. We propose that screening of antimicrobials for use in food systems in nutrient-deficient systems is inappropriate and that new protocols should be developed.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Listeria innocua and Leuconostoc dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens and two strains of Escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 MPa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 MPa) was compared in this study. Within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. All gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. Within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. Further it appears that the mutant E. coli LMM1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure homogenisation than its parental strain MG1655. The preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. Further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus cell population by using low pH (5.5 7), NaCl (0 6%) or SDS (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. Finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus.
TI  - An in vitro assay to evaluate competitive exclusion products for poultry.
AB  - An in vitro assay was developed to measure the ability of competitive exclusion (CE) bacteria to protect Caco-2 and CRL-2117 epithelial cells from invasion by Salmonella Typhimurium. The proposed assay is needed to expedite the development of defined-flora CE products. The average significantly protective concentration of the commercial poultry-specific CE product Preempt was 4.05 log CFU/6.41 log human Caco-2 cells and 3.71 log CFU/6.89 log CFU chicken CRL-2117 cells, Enterococcus faecalis isolated from Preempt protected CRL-2117 cells, Escherichia coli isolates protected Caco-2 cells, Lactococcus lactis and Bacteroides distasonis isolates protected both cell lines, and three species of Lactobacillus isolates failed to protect either cell line. A defined mixture of 29 strains of bacteria similar to the constituents of Preempt protected both cell lines from Salmonella invasion at a concentration of 7.83 log CFU. The constituents of the defined CE culture were separated into mixtures of obligate (8.42 log CFU) and facultative (8.49 log CFU) anaerobes, which both protected the cell lines, suggesting that both types of bacteria were equally protective. Although not a substitute for in vivo testing, the in vitro CE assay is a rapid technique for the evaluation of bacterial mixtures for potential CE products.
TI  - Livestock issues. Overpowering manure.
AB  
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - The LuxS family of bacterial autoinducers: biosynthesis of a novel quorum-sensing signal molecule.
AB  - Many bacteria control gene expression in response to cell population density, and this phenomenon is called quorum sensing. In Gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing typically involves the production, release and detection of acylated homoserine lactone signalling molecules called autoinducers. Vibrio harveyi, a Gram-negative bioluminescent marine bacterium, regulates light production in response to two distinct autoinducers (AI-1 and AI-2). AI-1 is a homoserine lactone. The structure of AI-2 is not known. We have suggested previously that V. harveyi uses AI-1 for intraspecies communication and AI-2 for interspecies communication. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that many species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produce AI-2 and, in every case, production of AI-2 is dependent on the function encoded by the luxS gene. We show here that LuxS is the AI-2 synthase and that AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylmethionine in three enzymatic steps. The substrate for LuxS is S-ribosylhomocysteine, which is cleaved to form two products, one of which is homocysteine, and the other is AI-2. In this report, we also provide evidence that the biosynthetic pathway and biochemical intermediates in AI-2 biosynthesis are identical in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, V. harveyi, Vibrio cholerae and Enterococcus faecalis. This result suggests that, unlike quorum sensing via the family of related homoserine lactone autoinducers, AI-2 is a unique, 'universal' signal that could be used by a variety of bacteria for communication among and between species.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of food-borne pathogens to Caco-2 cells by Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - AIMS: To select adhesive strains among strains of Lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve Lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using Caco-2 cell cultures. The two most adhesive strains, Lactobacillus crispatus JCM 8779 and Lact. reuteri JCM 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Enterococcus faecalis strains. Adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both Lactobacillus strains. Adhesion of Ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by JCM 8779. Although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested JCM 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against Ent. faecalis. CONCLUSION: The strong antiadhesion activity of JCM 8779 against Ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report that Lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.
TI  - Aggregation substance promotes colonic mucosal invasion of Enterococcus faecalis  in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial translocation through the gastrointestinal tract is the crucial step in the pathogenesis of intraabdominal infections. We assessed whether aggregation substance (AS), a bacterial adhesin and virulence factor of Enterococcus faecalis, promotes bacterial translocation and colonic mucosal invasion in an ex vivo experiment. METHODS: Colonic mucosa of male Wistar rats was placed in a modified Ussing system. The mucosal side of the chamber was filled with a suspension of E. faecalis OG1X:pAM721 (AS-positive) or E. faecalis OG1X (AS-negative). The serosal side was filled with sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For assessment of colonic mucosal invasion the mucosal side was incubated for 2.5 h with a suspension of AS-positive or AS-negative enterococci. After being washed, a solution of gentamicin and penicillin G in tissue culture medium was added on both sides in order to kill extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, the mucosa was removed from the system, washed, lysed with Triton X-100, and homogenized. Viable intramural bacteria were quantified by plating serial dilutions of the homogenate on Todd-Hewitt broth agar plates. To quantify bacterial translocation samples which were taken at various time points from the serosal side were plated on Todd-Hewitt broth agar plates and colony forming units (CFU) were determined. RESULTS: Invasion of the AS-positive E. faecalis strain OG1X:pAM721 into the colonic mucosa was significantly higher than invasion rates of the AS-negative strain OG1X (2.88 log(10) CFU/ml vs 1.73 log(10) CFU/ml; P = 0.02). However, none of the tested strains was found to translocate from the mucosal to the serosal side within the incubation time of 4 h. CONCLUSIONS: The aggregation substance promotes invasion of E. faecalis into colonic mucosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. However, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. In the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia col, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. Lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). Six oils did not inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. Variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. Twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity against C. albicans, Staph. aureus and E. coli. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against C. albicans and E. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against Staph. aureus. These results support the notion that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - Decontamination of drinking water by direct heating in solar panels.
AB  - A device was developed for direct heating of water by solar radiation in a flow-through system of copper pipes. An adjustable thermostat valve prevents water below the chosen temperature from being withdrawn. The results show that it is possible to eliminate coliform and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from naturally contaminated river water by heating to temperatures of 65 degrees C or above. Artificial additions of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli to contaminated river water were also inactivated after heating to 65 degrees C and above. The total viable count could be reduced by a factor of 1000. The heat-resistant bacteria isolated from the Mlalakuva River (Tanzania) were spore-forming bacteria which exhibited greater heat resistance than commonly used test bacteria originating from countries with colder climates. To provide a good safety margin it is recommended that an outlet water temperature of 75 degrees C be used. At that temperature the daily production was about 501 of decontaminated water per m2 of solar panel, an amount that could be doubled by using a heat exchanger to recycle the heat.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - A standardized protocol for the rapid preparation of bacterial DNA for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - A rapid method for the preparation of bacterial DNA for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was developed for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This method was accomplished by reducing the time for the cell lysis reaction, restriction endonuclease digestion, and electrophoresis to 1, 1.5, and 18 h, respectively. The whole procedure from the initial bacterial culture plate to the final analysis of restriction fragments can be completed within 24 h. This rapid method was successfully achieved for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Novel application of 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole to identify cysteine sulfenic acid in the AhpC component of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase.
AB  - The trapping of a sulfenic acid within the fully active C165S mutant of the AhpC  peroxidase protein from Salmonella typhimurium was investigated. The electrophilic reagent employed in these studies, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl), has previously been used to modify thiol, amino, and tyrosine hydroxyl groups in proteins; at neutral pH only cysteinyl residues of AhpC proteins are modified. The peroxide-oxidized C165S mutant of AhpC incubated with NBD-Cl gave a product with an absorbance maximum at 347 nm, whereas the thiol-NBD conjugate formed from the reduced protein absorbed maximally at 420 nm. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the modified proteins allowed identification of the species absorbing at 347 nm as a Cys-S(O)-NBD derivative containing one additional oxygen relative to the Cys-S-NBD product. The C165S conjugates with Cys-S(O)-NBD and Cys-S-NBD had no peroxidase activity when compared to unreacted C165S and wild-type AhpC, but were both reactivated through removal of NBD by DTT. Oxidized C165S was also modified by dimedone, a common sulfenic acid reagent, to give the expected inactivated conjugate of higher mass. This reagent was not removed by DTT and blocked any further reaction of the protein with NBD-Cl. NBD modification of Enterococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase, a well-characterized flavoprotein with an active-site sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH), also yielded the spectrally-distinguishable NBD conjugates following incubation of NBD-Cl with oxidized and reduced forms of the denatured peroxidase, indicating a general utility for this reagent with other sulfenic acid-containing proteins. A significant advantage of NBD-Cl over previously-used sulfenic acid reagents such as dimedone is in the retention of the sulfenic acid oxygen in the modified product; differentiation between protein-associated thiols and sulfenic acids is therefore now possible by means of both visible absorbance properties and mass analyses of the NBD-modified proteins.
TI  - Intracellular survival of enteric bacteria in cultured human enterocytes.
AB  - Translocating enteric bacteria have been visualized within intact intestinal epithelial cells in animal models of bacterial translocation. Although the ability of the enterocyte to engulf bacteria has been well documented in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models, relatively little is known about the enterocyte's ability to degrade internalized bacteria. Intracellular survival of eight strains of enteric bacteria (two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, two strains of Escherichia coli, and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis) was quantified over a 20 h period using two different types of terminally differentiated polarized enterocytes considered relevant in vitro models of human small intestinal epithelium, namely Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Caco-2 enterocytes were generally more permissive for bacterial uptake when compared with HT-29 enterocytes. However, bacterial survival was similar within each type of enterocyte, and most strains of enteric bacteria remained viable within enterocytes for the 20 h duration of the assay. In addition, with the exception of one strain of L. monocytogenes in Caco-2 cells, intracellular enteric bacteria had no noticeable effect on host enterocyte viability for this 20 h duration. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize both intact and degraded bacteria within individual enterocytes, suggesting that prolonged bacterial survival might have resulted from simultaneous bacterial degradation and replication. Thus, although enterocytes internalize enteric bacteria, enterocytes might not kill internalized bacteria as efficiently as leukocytes. Observations of bacterial intracellular survival supported the hypothesis that the enterocyte might be a portal of entry for translocating microbes, and observations of intracellular bacterial degradation might have implications for the role of the enterocyte as an antigen-presenting cell.
TI  - [Bioantimutagenic effect of the culture fluid of Streptococcus faecalis on mutagenesis induced by 2-nitrofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA 1538 and TA 98].
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis growing in rich organic media or synthetic medium containing 0.1% trypton and 0.05% yeast extract was shown to form substances with a bioantimutagenic activity against the mutagenicity of 2-nitrofluorene and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, which induce frameshift and base-pair substitution mutations, respectively. The maximum accumulation of antimutagens in the medium was observed within 16-24 h of growth. The modified Ames test showed that the culture liquid of Str. faecalis possessed a higher antimutagenic activity for Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 1538 than for strain TA 98 with an enhanced SOS response. Fractionation of the culture liquid revealed that the bioantimutagenic activity is localized in the fraction of peptides with molecular masses of less than 12 kDa.
TI  - Evidence for direct-acting oxidative genotoxicity by reduction products of azo dyes.
AB  - The intestinal flora forms a complex ecosystem that metabolizes dietary and endogenous nutrients under primarily anaerobic conditions. The ingestion of azo dyes has been proposed as one source of potential genotoxic agents. Many intestinal bacteria are able to reduce the azo bond (termed azofission), which liberates the substituted naphthol compounds. The standard Ames test has not demonstrated mutagenicity either by various common food colorings or by their reduced end products in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. In contrast, genetic toxicity was demonstrated in the Escherichia coli differential kill assay and in S. typhimurium TA102 for the reduced dyes. The superoxide free radical was produced by the azo dyes only after reduction by the intestinal bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
TI  - Survival, physiological response and recovery of enteric bacteria exposed to a polar marine environment.
AB  - Survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus  faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees C; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (DVCs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. T90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica and 432 h for E. faecalis. Sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. DVCs, CTC reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. Forty-eight-day exposure of E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees C. The detection of responsive E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica by the DVC and CTC methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. Percentages of respiring E. coli and S. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. Large nutrient inputs to low-temperature marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.
TI  - Potential growth and control of Salmonella in Hispanic type soft cheese.
AB  - This study evaluated the growth and control of Salmonella serotypes in a soft Hispanic type cheese (Queso Fresco). Cheese was made in the laboratory using a commercial procedure and after inoculation it was stored under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 6 to 30 degrees C. The minimum temperature that allowed growth of Salmonella was 8 degrees C. Accumulated data from the growth studies were used for the development of models relating the square root of 1/LT (LT = lag time) and specific growth rate to temperature. The effect of selected antimicrobials (potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and sodium lactate) on the growth and survival of Salmonella in milk and in cheese at various storage temperatures was also examined. Addition of sodium benzoate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.6) or addition of potassium sorbate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.0) made from milk, which was acidified to pH 5.9 with propionic acid, had a significant impact on delaying or preventing growth of the pathogen.
TI  - Cloning and molecular analysis of genes affecting expression of binding substance, the recipient-encoded receptor(s) mediating mating aggregate formation in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Transfer of the conjugative plasmid pCF10 in Enterococcus faecalis strains involves production of a plasmid-encoded aggregation substance on the surface of donor cells in response to stimulation by a pheromone secreted by recipient cells. Aggregation substance then facilitates attachment to recipient cells via a chromosomally encoded receptor, termed binding substance (BS). A BS mutant, strain INY3000, generated by random Tn916 insertions, was previously found to carry copies of the transposon at four unique sites (K. M. Trotter and G. M. Dunny, Plasmid 24:57-67, 1990). In the present study, DNA flanking the Tn916 insertions was used to complement the BS mutation of INY3000 following Tn916 excision from cloned chromosomal fragments. Complementation results showed that three of the four regions mutated in INY3000 play some role in BS expression. Tn5 mutagenesis and DNA sequence analysis of the complementing fragment from one of these regions indicated the presence of three genes (ebsA, ebsB, and ebsC) that affect BS expression. The ebsA and ebsB genes encode peptides likely to function in cell wall metabolism, whereas ebsC may encode a product that suppresses the function or expression of EbsB.
TI  - Effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on Salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  - A defined bacterial culture protective against Salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (CF) culture apparatus. Chicks receiving the CF culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by S. typhimurium. The culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus avium, two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (designated A and B), Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus animalis, a Lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain CMS), Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, E. fergusonii, Bifidobacterium animals, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici. Results indicated that CF cultures can be used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to S. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
TI  - Effect of LPS on epithelial integrity and bacterial uptake in the polarized human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been speculated to facilitate bacterial translocation by a mechanism involving physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. Polarized, cultured intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 cells) were used to study the effect of LPS on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. Varying concentrations of biologically active LPS were incubated with enterocytes for 1 and 16 hr. LPS had no noticeable effect on enterocyte viability or morphology, as measured by uptake of vital dyes, by distribution of cytoskeletal filamentous actin, and by visualization of subcellular ultrastructure. Transepithelial electrical resistance was similar in enterocyte cultures incubated with LPS for 1 hr, but there was a noticeable decrease after 16 hr, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity after prolonged exposure to LPS. The effect of LPS on bacterial uptake was studied using six strains of enteric bacteria with varying abilities to invade Caco-2 cells: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli (2 strains), and Enterococcus faecalis. Electron microscopy showed enteric bacteria in intimate association with enterocyte apical microvilli, and internalized bacteria were consistently observed within cytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles. Following a 1-hr incubation of individual strains of enteric bacteria with Caco-2 cells, numbers of viable intracellular bacteria varied significantly between individual bacterial strains, but numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for each strain incubated with enterocytes exposed to 0, 10, and 100 micrograms LPS for 1 and 16 hr. Thus, although prolonged exposure to LPS might have some effect on enterocyte culture integrity (as measured by decreased electrical resistance), LPS had no discernible effect on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. These results suggested that LPS-induced bacterial translocation might not involve loss of epithelial viability, or facilitated entry of bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. The blood was inoculated with one of five species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per mL. The growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees C storage period of the platelet concentrates. One species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, failed to grow in any of the components. The remaining species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by Day 3. Although the concentration of bacteria immediately after inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. Data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.
TI  - Oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. Ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (two strains), Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and a Bacteroides sp. The phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. The three Listeria strains were the most susceptible to phagocytic uptake and the Salmonella strain was relatively resistant. The intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. The strains with the best intracellular survival were Ent. faecalis and two of the three Listeria strains. The ability of S. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two E. coli strains. Oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.
TI  - Flavin-linked peroxide reductases: protein-sulfenic acids and the oxidative stress response.
AB  - Sequence analyses of the Streptococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase and the flavoprotein component of the Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase indicate clear evolutionary links with members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. However, chemical and spectroscopic evidence demonstrate that the non-flavin redox center in NADH peroxidase is an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) derivative, and not a cystine disulfide as found in the disulfide reductases. This redox-active element, when appropriately stabilized by the respective protein environment, appears to play key roles in both the catalytic and regulatory aspects of the bacterial response to oxidative stress.
TI  - The influence of temperature on the behaviour of mixed bacterial contamination of the shell membrane of the hen's egg.
AB  - The inner membrane of the air cell of hens' eggs was inoculated with Pseudomonas  putida, Staphylococcus xylosus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. The first mentioned eventually dominated the contamination of the albumen of eggs stored at 4, 15, and 20 degrees C. The last mentioned did so in eggs stored at 37 degrees C. The interval between inoculation of the membrane and gross contamination of the albumen was markedly influenced by site of contamination relative to yolk movement.
TI  - Selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of Salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - As few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus and Fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on Salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. In a single culture, the population of S. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. Antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. Optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. These carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly E. coli and B. ovatus. However, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population of S. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.
TI  - An investigation of indirect conductimetry for detection of some food-borne bacteria.
AB  - Indirect conductimetry using a rapid automated bacterial impedance technique was  investigated. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Salmonella spp. grown in Whitley Impedance broth all elicited indirect conductimetric changes. These indirect conductance responses were improved by the addition of 2 g/l glucose to the medium and resulted in maximum changes of 2340-4300 microS with associated maximum rates of change of 520-1210 microS/h. Furthermore, the indirect conductimetric assay detected growth of staphylococci, listeria and salmonella in media containing high concentrations of salts used as selective agents in culture media for the isolation of these organisms.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - Partial nucleotide sequence of the pts operon in Salmonella typhimurium: comparative analyses in five bacterial genera.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a Salmonella typhimurium DNA segment of 549 base pairs which encompasses the operator-promoter of the pts operon, the entirety of the ptsH gene, encoding HPr of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), the first 29 nucleotides of the ptsI gene, encoding Enzyme I of the PTS, and the intercistronic region between the ptsH and ptsI genes was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence from Escherichia coli (De Reuse et al., 1985). The two sequences showed 91% overall identity, with some regions showing sequence conservation and others exhibiting relative divergence. Two open reading frames were identified in both species: one encoded HPr on the 'sense' strand (255 nucleotides; 12 nucleotide differences, no amino acid differences); the other, on the anti-sense strand, consisted of 291 nucleotides (13 nucleotide differences, 13 amino acid differences). While HPr bears a net negative charge, the putative protein encoded by the open reading frame on the anti-sense strand is strongly basic. Computer analyses of HPr proteins from five different bacterial genera revealed four regions which show strong sequence identity and therefore are presumed to be critical for maintenance of biological activity. Two of these regions were specific to Gram-positive bacteria. Proposed functions for each of these regions are discussed. Relative evolutionary distances between the HPr proteins were also computed.

AB  - HR 810 or cefpirome is a new amino thiazole cephalosporin whose specific characteristic is a cyclopentenopyridinium group in position 3 of the cephem nucleus. This structure is responsible for a broad spectrum of activity, covering Enterobacteriaceae, including cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D Streptococci.

TI  - Bacterial survival and association with sludge flocs during aerobic and anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge under laboratory conditions.
AB  - The fate of indicator bacteria, a bacterial pathogen, and total aerobic bacteria  during aerobic and anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge under laboratory conditions was determined. Correlation coefficients were calculated between physical and chemical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, total solids, and volatile solids) and either the daily change in bacterial numbers or the percentage of bacteria in the supernatant. The major factor influencing survival of Salmonella typhimurium and indicator bacteria during aerobic digestion was the temperature of sludge digestion. At 28 degrees C with greater than 4 mg of dissolved oxygen per liter, the daily change in numbers of these bacteria was approximately -1.0 log10/ml. At 6 degrees C, the daily change was less than -0.3 log10/ml. Most of the bacteria were associated with the sludge flocs during aerobic digestion of sludge at 28 degrees C with greater than 2.4 mg of dissolved oxygen per liter. Lowering the temperature or the amount of dissolved oxygen decreased the fraction of bacteria associated with the flocs and increased the fraction found in the supernatant.
TI  - Effects of moisture content on long-term survival and regrowth of bacteria in wastewater sludge.
AB  - The effects of moisture content on the survival and regrowth of seeded and indigenous enteric bacteria in raw sludge were determined. Cultures of six strains of fecally associated bacteria grown in sterilized, liquid sludge (5% solids) were all quite stable at this moisture level for over 90 days at 21 degrees C. When the moisture content of the sludge containing these organisms was reduced by evaporation and the samples were stored at 21 degrees C for extended periods, bacterial inactivation rates were generally proportional to the moisture losses of the samples. A dramatic reversal in this effect was observed in samples containing more than 90% solids. In this dried sludge, every bacterial species studied except Proteus mirabilis was found to be extremely stable. Bacteria indigenous to sludge were also found to survive for long periods in dried sludge. Regrowth of bacterial isolates in sterilized raw sludge was found to occur readily at 37 degrees C in samples containing less than or equal to 75% solids, but no growth was observed in samples with greater than or equal to 85% solids. Some growth, but to less than saturation densities, occurred with 80% solids. Growth of seeded Salmonella typhimurium was also found to occur in the presence of indigenous organisms in both liquid and dewatered raw sludges. However, the population density attained was well below that found in sterilized samples of the same sludges. In addition, the number of salmonellae dropped below detectable limits within a few days in sludges containing viable indigenous organisms, whereas little decrease occurred during this time with salmonellae grown in previously sterilized sludges.

TI  - [Inactivation of viruses and bacteria in sewage sludge by gamma radiation (author's transl)].
AB  - The kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. All these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. The reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. Considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. The radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.
TI  - Biological properties of L-forms and their parent bacteria.

AB  - A high correlation of the salmonellae and enterococci indices with the distance from the sources of contamination (effluents) at calm weather and reduced correlation at storm was revealed in examination of coastal waters of Baltic sea for salmonellae and indicator microbes in the biotypes of two populated localities. Monotypical character of the isolated salmonellae served as the peculiarity of the results obtained: S. typhimurium prevailed (96.3%): S. give were isolated in 3.7% of the cases. The latter were isolated chiefly in the biotypes of one of the populated localities (B); their relative content showed a sharp elevation during storm.
TI  - [Preliminary tests of the influence of wastewaters from sugar-factories upon the  numbers of intestinal bacteria in water (author's transl)].
AB  - This work presents the results of experiments dealing with the influence of wastewaters from 2 sugar factories in the Czechoslovakia upon some representatives of intestinal bacteria: E. coli, C. feundii, E. aerogenes, S. anatum, S. schottmuelleri, S. typhi-murium, Sh. sonnei and Str. faecalis. The experiments were carried out at 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. The experiments have shown that the presterilized waste-water from sugar factory (in Bohemia and in Slovakia) caused rapid multiplication of the test-organisms: E. coli, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, S. anatum, S. schottmuelleri, S. typhi-murium, less by Sh. sonnei and Str. faecalis, at 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. The intensity of multiplication was direct proportional to the concentration of waste water and was effective to dilution 1:1000 (diluted with presterilized surface waters Vltava, Danube).

TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - On the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
AB  - Cell division by strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-DU). Division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. Recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-DU and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline pH. Growth with 5-DU caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of S. typhimurium. The agent caused chaining in Streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of S. typhimurium. These effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. The most marked effect of 5-DU on S. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of DNA synthesis. Since 5-DU did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of DNA replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-DU than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-DU acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on DNA replication.
TI  - The effect of cooling and warming rates on the survival of a variety of bacteria.
AB  - Cooling and warming rates affect bacterial survival profoundly with all bacteria  tested (Azotobacter chroococcum, Klebsiella aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis) behaving similarly. Most bacteria were sensitive to salt on freezing and thawing. Viabilities of population frozen and thawed in saline were always less (by at least 20%) than comparable ones frozen in water alone. Under these conditions, S. faecalis was resistant to the presence of sodium chloride; viabilities of populations frozen in the presence or absence of sodium chloride were always less than 5% different. The implications of these results in light of the organisms' shape, Gram stain, and respiration are discussed.

TI  - Hydrophobic grid-membrane filters: new approach to microbiological enumeration.
AB  - A square grid pattern, printed in hydrophobic material on conventional membrane filters, subdivided the surface into a plurality of areas. This separated colonies from one another and prevented lateral growth, spreading, and confluence. Very high colony-packing densities were achieved (2,500/in(2); ca. 1.61 x 10(5)/cm(2)) reducing the need to dilute samples. Recovery of organisms was better than on conventional filters, particularly at high inoculum levels. At the same time, visibility of normally pale or diffuse colonies was improved, since colonies grew upwards instead of sideways, and counting was facilitated because colonies grew in orderly arrays.

AB  - Studies have been conducted over a 2-year period to determine the extent to which a poultry processing plant served as a reservoir of salmonellae reaching the external environment, to examine the question of the importance of salmonellae in the environment, and to consider how best to control the spread of the organisms. The studies have been undertaken at a chicken processing plant handling between 75,000 and 80,000 birds per day. Populations of salmonellae and indicator bacteria were estimated in the raw wastes, through the waste treatment plant, and in the receiving stream waters. The results demonstrate that salmonellae are present in poultry processing wastes in a surprisingly constant relation to fecal coliforms (in excess of 1 Salmonella per 500 fecal coliforms), that serotypes in the environment are constantly changing, and that they may reflect unusual conditions in the processing plant, or a possible source of infection among human and animal residents of the environment. Disinfection of poultry processing wastes is recommended.

TI  - An enzyme-based theory of obligate anaerobiosis: the physiological function of superoxide dismutase.
AB  - The distribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase has been examined in various micro-organisms. Strict anaerobes exhibited no superoxide dismutase and, generally, no catalase activity. All aerobic organisms containing cytochrome systems were found to contain both superoxide dismutase and catalase. Aerotolerant anaerobes, which survive exposure to air and metabolize oxygen to a limited extent but do not contain cytochrome systems, were found to be devoid of catalase activity but did exhibit superoxide dismutase activity. This distribution is consistent with the proposal that the prime physiological function of superoxide dismutase is protection of oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the potentially detrimental effects of the superoxide free radical, a biologically produced intermediate resulting from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen.
TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

Isolation of this compound was accomplished by use of ion-exchange chromatography and countercurrent distribution. It crystallized from methyl isobutyl ketone in colorless acicular plates which melted at 127 to 130 C. The empirical formula was C(42)H(75)NO(14) with a molecular weight of 820. Electrometric titration in 66% dimethylformamide showed an apparent pKa of 8.4. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet absorption indicated a close resemblance of the compound to known erythromycins, although its chromatographic behavior and solubility differed from those of the known erythromycins. Its antimicrobial spectrum was similar to erythromycin A, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations were much higher.
