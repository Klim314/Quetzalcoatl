TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == understanding how commensal obligate anaerobic bacteria regulate immune functions in the large intestine.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract is colonised by trillions of commensal bacteria, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the large intestine. appropriate bacterial colonisation is generally known to be critical for human health. in particular, the development and function of the immune system depends on microbial colonisation, and a regulated cross-talk between commensal bacteria, intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells is required to maintain mucosal immune homeostasis. this homeostasis is disturbed in various inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. several in vitro and in vivo studies indicate a role for faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, akkermansia muciniphila and segmented filamentous bacteria in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. these obligate anaerobes are abundant in the healthy intestine but reduced in several inflammatory diseases, suggesting an association with protective effects on human health. however, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the effects of obligate anaerobic intestinal bacteria remains limited, in part due to the difficulty of co-culturing obligate anaerobes together with oxygen-requiring human epithelial cells. by using novel dual-environment co-culture models, it will be possible to  investigate the effects of the unstudied majority of intestinal microorganisms on the human epithelia. this knowledge will provide opportunities for improving human health and reducing the risk of inflammatory diseases.

TI  == altered microbiota associated with abnormal humoral immune responses to commensal organisms in enthesitis-related arthritis.
AB  == introduction: prior studies have established altered microbiota and immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (spa), we hypothesized that spa patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.  methods: stool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (era) and non-inflammatory controls. dna purified from stool was subject to pcr amplification and sequencing of the variable iv region from the 16s rdna gene. iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects. results:  twenty-five children with era and 13 controls were included. the era patients had less faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, p = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, p = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, p = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in bacteroides (21% versus 11%, p = 0.150). akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (>2%) in 7/27 era patients but none of the controls (p = 0.072.) cluster analysis revealed two clusters of era patients: cluster one (n =  8) was characterized by high levels of bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls. seven of 17 (41%) of the era subjects in cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in cluster 1 had abundant akkermansia muciniphila (p = 0.057). serum iga and igg antibody levels against f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides were compared individually against iga antibody levels recognizing f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: the  abundance of f. prausnitzii in the stool among patients with era is reduced compared to controls, and bacteroides and a. muciniphila are identified as associative agents in subsets of era patients. differences in the humoral responses to these bacteria may contribute to disease.

TI  == the microbiota of the gut in preschool children with normal and excessive body weight.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the gut microbiota in preschool children with and without overweight and obesity. twenty overweight or obese children and  twenty children with bmi within the normal range (age: 4-5 years) were recruited  from the south of sweden. the gut microbiota was accessed by quantitative pcr (qpcr) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and calprotectin was measured in feces. liver enzymes were quantified in obese/overweight children. the concentration of the gram-negative family enterobacteriaceae was significantly higher in the obese/overweight children (p = 0.036), whereas levels of desulfovibrio and akkermansia muciniphila-like bacteria were significantly lower in the obese/overweight children (p = 0.027 and p = 0.030, respectively). no significant differences were found in content of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium or the bacteroides fragilis group. the diversity of the dominating bacterial community tended to be less diverse in the obese/overweight  group, but the difference was not statistically significant. concentration of bifidobacterium was inversely correlated to alanine aminotransferase (alt) in obese/overweight children. the fecal levels of calprotectin did not differ between the study groups. these findings indicate that the gut microbiota differed among preschool children with obesity/overweight compared with children  with bmi within the normal range.
