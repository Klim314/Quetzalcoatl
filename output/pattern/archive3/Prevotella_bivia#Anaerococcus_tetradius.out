comparative in vitro activity of ph-027 versus linezolid and other anti-anaerobic antimicrobials against clinical isolates of clostridium difficile and other anaerobic bacteria.
ph-027 is a new 5-triazole oxazolidinone synthesized in our laboratories, which shows strong activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including clinical isolates. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of this compound in comparison with linezolid and other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. the in vitro activity of ph-027 in comparison with those of linezolid and other antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 201 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by agar dilution and etest methods. ph-027 showed excellent activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) in the range of 0.12-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates; mic90s being 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against clostridium difficile, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, prevotella bivia and fusobacterium spp. respectively. in comparison, linezolid had mic in the range of 0.5-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates, with mic90s of 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against the same set of bacteria respectively. ph-027 demonstrated excellent in vitro activity that is superior to linezolid against peptostreptococcus spp., b. fragilis and p. bivia. however, against c. difficile and fusobacterium spp, ph-027 and linezolid showed comparable in vitro activity. against all anaerobes, metronidazole, ph-027 and, to a lesser extent, linezolid had the most potent activity. from the results of in vitro susceptibility testing, both linezolid and ph-027 show promise in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
[the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.
synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 gram-positive or gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 bacteroides fragilis group, 36 prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. mic50/mic90 values (mg/l) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. synergy (fic indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. all other combinations were additive (fic indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (fic indices >4.0) was seen. in addition, synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 gram-positive or gram-negative strains. results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/ml at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the mic and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the mic in one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium varium, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and clostridium bifermentans. synergy between trovafloxacin (</=mic) and metronidazole alone was seen in one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium mortiferum, p. asaccharolyticus and c. bifermentans. in many cases of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin mic, regrowth after 48 h, which was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
am-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the antibacterial activity of am-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. the in vivo efficacy of am-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (e. coli and b. fragilis) model of rats. the accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in the am-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent am-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
