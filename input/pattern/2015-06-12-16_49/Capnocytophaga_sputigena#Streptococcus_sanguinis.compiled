TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. There are three myeloperoxidase isoforms: MPO I, MPO II and MPO III. We examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Streptococcus sanguis. Isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-A-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. Most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in MPO I and diminished in MPO III. Exceptionally, serum-opsonized A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. Because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests based upon myeloperoxidase.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - The effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (IgG) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  - The influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD). The immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were determined by the microELISA technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). Considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. Significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to A. viscosus, S. sanguis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, B. melaninogenicus, T. vincentii, and T. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. There was no consistent response to Capnocytophaga. When individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. Antibody levels to bacteria such as S. sanguis were modified during therapy. This would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. The subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. Using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. Active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. The control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. Bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. Similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. The proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of Bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. sputigena and Eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of B. intermedius and E. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species had increased. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. The proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis II and Campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. Humoral antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena significantly increased in a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. Antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. Crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
