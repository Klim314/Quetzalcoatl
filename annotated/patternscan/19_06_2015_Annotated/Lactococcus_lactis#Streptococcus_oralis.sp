TI  == effect of acidic ph on expression of surface-associated proteins of streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis, a member of the mitis group of oral streptococci, is implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and is the predominant aciduric non-mutans-group streptococcus in dental plaque. we undertook to identify the most abundant surface-associated proteins of s. oralis and to investigate changes in protein expression when the organism was grown under acidic culture conditions. surface-associated proteins were extracted from cells  grown in batch culture, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption  ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. putative functions were assigned by homology to a translated genomic database of streptococcus pneumoniae. a total of 27 proteins were identified; these included a lipoprotein, a ribosome recycling factor, and the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enolase. the most abundant protein, phosphocarrier protein hpr, was present as three isoforms. neither lactate dehydrogenase nor pyruvate oxidase, dominant intracellular proteins, were present among the proteins on the gels, demonstrating that proteins in the surface-associated pool did not arise as a result of cell lysis. eleven of the proteins identified were differentially expressed when cells were grown at ph 5.2 versus ph 7.0, and these included superoxide dismutase, a homologue of dipeptidase v from lactococcus lactis, and the protein translation elongation factors g, tu, and ts. this study has extended the range of streptococcal proteins known to be expressed at the cell surface. further investigations are required to ascertain their functions at this extracellular location and determine how their expression is influenced by other environmental conditions.

TI  == selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. we examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two streptococcus thermophilus and two lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as streptococcus sobrinus omz176. two of them, strep. thermophilus ncc1561 and lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis ncc2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five  strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. in this system, lactoc. lactis ncc2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of streptococcus oralis  omz607, veillonella dispar omz493, actinomyces naeslundii omz745 and of the cariogenic strep. sobrinus omz176. these findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
