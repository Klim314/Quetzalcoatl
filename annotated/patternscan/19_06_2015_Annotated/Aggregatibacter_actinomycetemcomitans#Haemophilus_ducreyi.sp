TI  == [cytolethal distending toxins].
AB  == cytolethal distending toxins (cdt) are intracellularly acting proteins which interfere with the eukaryotic cell cycle. they are produced by gram-negative bacteria with affinity to mucocutaneous surfaces and could play a role in the pathogenesis of various mammalian diseases. the functional toxin is composed of three proteins: cdtb entering the nucleus and by its nuclease activity inducing nuclear fragmentation and chromatin disintegration, cdta, and cdtc, the two latter being responsible for toxin attachment to the surface of the target cell.  cytotoxic effect of cdt leads to the cell cycle arrest before the cell enters mitosis and to further changes (cell distension and death, apoptosis) depending on the cell type. thus, cdt may function as a virulence factor in pathogenic bacteria that produce it and thus may contribute to the initiation of certain diseases. most important are inflammatory bowel diseases caused by intestinal bacteria, periodontitis with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as the aetiologic agent and ulcus molle where haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent.

TI  == inflammatory and bone remodeling responses to the cytolethal distending toxins.
AB  == the cytolethal distending toxins (cdts) are a family of exotoxins produced by a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. they are known for causing genotoxic stress to the cell, resulting in growth arrest and eventually apoptotic cell death. nevertheless, there is evidence that cdts can also perturb the innate immune responses, by regulating inflammatory cytokine production and molecular mediators of bone remodeling in various cell types. these cellular and molecular events may in turn have an effect in enhancing local inflammation in diseases where cdt-producing bacteria are involved, such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus ducreyi, campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter hepaticus. one special example is the induction of pathological bone destruction  in periodontitis. the opportunistic oral pathogen aggregatibatcer actinoycemetemcomitans, which is involved in the aggressive form of the disease,  can regulate the molecular mechanisms of bone remodeling in a manner that favors  bone resorption, with the potential involvement of its cdt. the present review provides an overview of all known to-date inflammatory or bone remodeling responses of cdts produced by various bacterial species, and discusses their potential contribution to the pathogenesis of the associated diseases.

TI  == cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxins (cdts) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by  a diverse group of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. based on their ability to induce dna damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, cdts are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. despite the widespread distribution of cdts  among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. here we demonstrate that cdts from haemophilus ducreyi, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in cdt binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. the absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four cdts tested. surprisingly,  fucosylated n-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in cdt-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the cdts tested. finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in cdt binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of cdts tested. the findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of cdt-host  interactions.

TI  == cytolethal distending toxin upregulates rankl expression in jurkat t-cells.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin, a bacterial exotoxin produced by a number of gram-negative species, causes growth arrest and morphological alterations in host cells. among these species are haemophilus ducreyi, the etiological agent of chancroid, and the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, highly implicated in localized aggressive periodontitis. cdt induces receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl) expression in periodontal fibroblasts, the  key bone-resorbing cytokine. t-cells are actively involved in localized inflammation-induced bone destruction, including periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of purified cdt on the expression of rankl and its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (opg), in the jurkat t-cell line. quantitative real-time pcr indicated that 100 pg/ml of purified h. ducreyi cdt upregulated rankl mrna expression by 2.2-fold, after 24 h of exposure. this increase was corroborated by a 2.0-fold increase in rankl protein release, as determined by elisa. opg was not detected in this experimental system. in conclusion, cdt enhances rankl expression in t-cells, denoting that these cells are a potential target for the toxin and strengthening the potential link between this virulence factor and mechanisms associated with localized bone resorption.

TI  == molecular phylogenetic analysis of tryptophanyl-trna synthetase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == aminoacyl-trna synthetase family enzymes are of particular interest for creating  universal phylogenetic trees and understanding the gene flow as these enzymes perform the basic and analogous biochemical function of protein synthesis in all  extant organisms. among them, tryptophanyl-trna synthetase (trp-rs) plays a foremost role in phylogeny owing to the close relationship with tyrosine-trna synthetase. in this study, the sequence of the gene trp-rs was amplified using degenerated adenylation domain primers in the periodontal bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the sequence of the cloned pcr amplicon confirmed the adenylation domain sequence with glutamic acid residue, which is absent in five other oral bacteria used in this study as well as in a number of other bacteria described in the database. the trp-rs sequence analysis prevailed  the identify elements such as rossmann-fold sequence and trna(trp) binding domains including acceptor stem and anticodon. a theoretical model of trp-rs of a. actinomycetemcomitans was generated. guided docking of the ligand tryptophanyl-5'-amp revealed a highly identical active site in comparison with the bacterial template. the phylogenetic positioning of trp-rs among a group of oral bacterial species revealed that a. actinomycetemcomitans is closely related  to haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == evidence that the cytolethal distending toxin locus was once part of a genomic island in the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans strain y4.
AB  == the authors have previously shown that the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans y4 contains an operon for a genotoxin known as the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). the cdt locus in strain y4 is flanked by remnants of heterologous plasmid and integrase sequences. in this study, the dna sequence immediately downstream from the cdt locus on the y4  chromosome was examined. the extended sequence contained a region that had all the characteristics of a typical bacterial pathogenicity or genomic island. the genomic island (giy4-1) was approximately 22 kb long, was flanked by a bacteriophage attachment (att) sequence and contained a full-length integrase/resolvase gene (xerd). a total of 22 complete and partial orfs represented putative dna replication/dna binding/conjugation proteins as well as  hypothetical proteins. giy4-1 was most closely related to putative genomic islands in haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp and haemophilus influenzae 86-028np and to a chromosomal region in haemophilus somnus 129pt. giy4-1 was not present in hk1651, which was used as the prototype strain for genomic sequencing of a. actinomycetemcomitans. several sequences in giy4-1 were homologous to orfs found  on the a. actinomycetemcomitans plasmid pvt745. none of the identified orfs in giy4-1 appeared to encode potential virulence genes. however, several unique observations supported the possibility that the cdt locus of a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 was originally contained within the genomic island.

TI  == variation of loop sequence alters stability of cytolethal distending toxin (cdt): crystal structure of cdt from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) secreted by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans induces cell cycle arrest of cultured cells in the g2 phase. the crystal structure of the natural form of a. actinomycetemcomitans dct  (acdt) has been determined at 2.4 a resolution. acdt is a heterotrimer consisting of the three subunits, acdta, acdtb, and acdtc. two crystallographically independent acdts form a dimer through interactions of the acdtb subunits. the primary structure of acdt has 94.3% identity with that of haemophilus ducreyi cdt (hcdt), and the structure of acdt is quite similar to that of hcdt reconstituted  from the three subunits determined recently. however, the molecular packings in the crystal structures of acdt and hcdt are quite different. a careful analysis of molecular packing suggests that variation of the amino acid residues in a nonconserved loop (181tsspssperrgy192 of acdtb and 181nsssspperrvy192 of hcdtb) is responsible for the different oligomerization of very similar cdts. the loop of acdtb has a conformation to form a dimer, while the loop conformation of hcdtb prevents hcdt from forming a dimer. although dimerization of acdt does not affect toxic activity, it changes the stability of protein. acdt rapidly aggregates and  loses toxic activity in the absence of sucrose in a buffered solution, while hcdt is stable and retains toxic activity. another analysis of crystal structures of acdt and hcdt suggests that the receptor contact area is in the deep groove between cdta and cdtc, and the characteristic "aromatic patch" on cdta.

TI  == characterization of point mutations in the cdta gene of the cytolethal distending toxin of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the cdt is a family of gram-negative bacterial toxins that typically arrest eukaryotic cells in the g0/g1 or g2/m phase of the cell cycle. the toxin is a heterotrimer composed of the cdta, cdtb and cdtc gene products. although it has been shown that the cdta protein subunit binds to cells in culture and in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (celisa) the precise mechanisms by which cdta interacts with cdtb and cdtc has not yet been clarified. in this study we employed a random mutagenesis strategy to construct a library of point mutations  in cdta to assess the contribution of individual amino acids to binding activity  and to the ability of the subunit to form biologically active holotoxin. single unique amino acid substitutions in seven cdta mutants resulted in reduced binding of the purified recombinant protein to chinese hamster ovary cells and loss of binding to the fucose-containing glycoprotein, thyroglobulin. these mutations clustered at the 5'- and 3'-ends of the cdta gene resulting in amino acid substitutions that resided outside of the aromatic patch region and a conserved region in cdta homologues. three of the amino acid substitutions, at positions s165n (muta81), t41a (muta121) and c178w (muta221) resulted in gene products that formed holotoxin complexes that exhibited a 60% reduction (muta81) or loss (muta121, muta221) of proliferation inhibition. a similar pattern was observed when these mutant holotoxins were tested for their ability to induce cell cycle arrest and to convert supercoiled dna to relaxed and linear forms in vitro. the mutations in muta81 and muta221 disrupted holotoxin formation. the positions of the amino acid substitutions were mapped in the haemophilus ducreyi cdt crystal structure providing some insight into structure and function.

TI  == the cytolethal distending toxin induces receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand expression in human gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis, a disease characterized by rapid loss of the alveolar bone surrounding the teeth. receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl) and osteoprotegerin (opg) are two molecules that regulate osteoclast formation and bone resorption. rankl induces osteoclast differentiation and activation, whereas opg blocks this process by acting as a decoy receptor for rankl. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a. actinomycetemcomitans on the expression of rankl and opg in human gingival fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells. rankl mrna expression was induced in both cell types challenged by a. actinomycetemcomitans extract, whereas opg mrna expression remained unaffected. cell surface rankl protein was also induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans, whereas there was no change in opg protein secretion. a cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) gene-knockout strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not induce rankl expression, in contrast to its wild-type strain. purified cdt from haemophilus ducreyi alone, or in combination  with extract from the a. actinomycetemcomitans cdt mutant strain, induced rankl expression. pretreatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans wild-type extract with cdt antiserum abolished rankl expression. in conclusion, a. actinomycetemcomitans induces rankl expression in periodontal connective tissue cells. cdt is crucial for this induction and may therefore be involved in the pathological bone resorption during the process of localized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == specificity of antibodies directed against the cytolethal distending toxin of haemophilus ducreyi in patients with chancroid.
AB  == antibodies specific for the cytolethal-distending toxin of haemophilus ducreyi (hdcdt) complex and for the cdta, cdtb, and cdtc components were measured by elisa in the sera of 50 patients with culture and/or pcr proven chancroid, 42 patients with periodontitis, 50 blood donors from tanzania, 50 blood donors from  sweden. in addition, the biological activity e.g. neutralization capacity of the  sera were tested. our results demonstrate that majority of chancroid patients and healthy individuals had detectable levels of serum antibodies to hdcdt complex and to separate toxin components. however, high levels (> or =100 units) of antibodies to hdcdt complex were significantly more prevalent in the sera of patients with both chancroid and periodontitis than in the sera of the corresponding controls (p=0.001 and p=0.04, respectively). in the sera of the 50  patients with chancroid, antibodies to cdta, cdtb, and cdtc were detected in 50,  35, and 34 individuals, respectively. antibodies to cdtc, being less frequently detected than the antibodies to other components, show a good correlation with the neutralizing capacity of sera. high levels of neutralizing antibodies (> or =160) were detected in only 22 and 2% of the patients with chancroid and periodontitis, respectively. the data suggest that the low levels of anti-hdcdt antibodies, which include neutralizing antibodies, may contribute to limited protection in chancroid and since anti-hdcdt antibodies, may be detected in healthy individuals and in patients with certain disease conditions (e.g. periodontitis), they may not be specific markers for chancroid infection.

TI  == prevalence of cdtabc genes encoding cytolethal distending toxin among haemophilus ducreyi and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the three cdtabc genes responsible for production of cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) in haemophilus ducreyi and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains. of 100 h. ducreyi strains from the culture collection of the university of goteborg (ccug), 27 strains with low or intermediate cytotoxic titre (< 1 in 10(4)) and 23 of the remaining isolates with a high cytotoxic titre (> or = 1 in 10(4)) were selected. twenty-nine strains of h. ducreyi were isolated recently from patients with chancroid and 50 a. actinomycetemcomitans strains from patients with periodontitis. the cytotoxic activity on hep-2 cells and the presence of cdtabc genes were studied by cytotoxicity assay of bacterial sonicates and pcr with primers specific for individual cdta, b, and c genes of h. ducreyi in bacterial dna preparations, respectively. all strains that manifested a cytotoxic titre in  sonicate > or = 1 in 100 possessed all the three cdt genes. eighteen of the 50 strains selected from the culture collection were negative and 32 positive for cdt genes. as all strains with a high cytotoxic titre gave positive pcr results,  it can be assumed that the remaining 50 strains, which have high cytotoxic titre, would have been positive as well. thus, it can be estimated that 82% of the culture collection strains had cdtabc genes. similarly, 24 (83%) of 29 recent h.  ducreyi isolates expressed the cdt activity and displayed all cdtabc genes. forty-three (86%) of 50 strains of the closely related a. actinomycetemcomitans,  expressing a cytotoxic activity > or = 1 in 100, also possessed all three genes.  furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the cdtabc genes was highly conserved among h. ducreyi strains from different geographic areas. these results indicate  that the majority of pathogenic h. ducreyi and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains express a cdt activity encoded by all three cdtabc.

TI  == expression of the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) operon in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: evidence that the cdtb protein is responsible for g2 arrest of the cell cycle in human t cells.
AB  == we have previously shown that actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtb gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (cdt) expressed by several gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we report that the cdt locus in a. actinomycetemcomitans is composed of five open reading frames, designated orf1, orf2, cdta, cdtb, and cdtc. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five open reading frames are highly conserved among a. actinomycetemcomitans strains 652, y4, 29522, and hk1651. there is also strong homology with the cdt proteins of haemophilus ducreyi (87-91%), but only partial homology with that of campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (29-48%). analysis of a. actinomycetemcomitans mrna by rt-pcr suggests that the two small open reading frames upstream of cdta are coexpressed  with cdta, cdtb, and cdtc. we next utilized a series of plasmids that express various combinations of the cdt genes to determine their requirement for expression of immunoinhibitory activity. cell extracts of e. coli transformed with each of the plasmids were tested for their capacity to induce g2 arrest in the cell cycle of pha-activated human t cells. these experiments suggest that expression of cdtb alone is sufficient to induce g2 arrest in human t cells, but  do not exclude the possibility that cdtc also contributes to cell cycle arrest. the implications of our results with respect to the function of the individual cdt proteins are discussed.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans immunosuppressive protein is a member of the family of cytolethal distending toxins capable of causing a g2 arrest in human t  cells.
AB  == we have previously shown that actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor (isf) capable of impairing human lymphocyte function by  perturbing cell cycle progression. we now report that isf is the product of the cdtb gene, one of three genes encoding the family of cytolethal distending toxins (cdt). the isf polypeptide exhibits >/=95% identity with hemophilus ducreyi cdtb  protein and </=60% homology with escherichia coli or campylobacter jejuni cdtb. pretreatment of pha-activated lymphocytes with 5-25 ng isf results in g2 arrest of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. similarly, treatment of hela cells results in g2 arrest and cell elongation and distension. however, lymphocytes are at least 5 times more sensitive to isf than hela cells and do not undergo the elongation and distension that characterizes interactions of cdts with cell lines. isf-treated lymphocytes express normal cyclin a and b1 levels, but contain reduced levels of  cell cycle-dependent kinase-1 (cdk1). additionally, the majority of cdk1 is in the hyperphosphorylated, inactive, form. in contrast, pha-induced g2 cells contain elevated levels of the hypophosphorylated, active cdk1. failure of isf-treated cells to dephosphorylate cdk1 is not associated with decreased availability of cdc25. these studies suggest that the cdtb protein alone is capable of inducing g2 arrest in lymphocytes and cell cycle arrest, elongation, and distension of hela cells. our studies also suggest that lymphocytes may be primary targets for a. actinomycetemcomitans cdtb (isf) and possibly for other cdt family members as well. thus, cdts may function to impair host immunity and contribute to the pathogenesis of disease associated with cdt-producing organisms.

TI  == identification of a cytolethal distending toxin gene locus and features of a virulence-associated region in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == a genetic locus for a cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) was identified in a polymorphic region of the chromosome of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a predominant oral pathogen. the locus was comprised of three open reading frames (orfs) that had significant amino acid sequence similarity and more than 90% sequence identity to the cdtabc genes of some pathogenic escherichia coli strains and haemophilus ducreyi, respectively. sonic extracts from recombinant e. coli, containing the a. actinomycetemcomitans orfs, caused the distension and killing of chinese hamster ovary cells characteristic of a cdt. monoclonal antibodies made reactive with the cdta, cdtb, and cdtc proteins of h. ducreyi recognized the corresponding gene products from the recombinant strain. cdt-like activities were no longer expressed by the recombinant strain when an omegakan-2 interposon was inserted into the cdta and cdtb genes. expression of the cdt-like activities in a. actinomycetemcomitans was strain specific. naturally occurring expression-negative strains had large deletions within the region of the cdt locus. the cdtabc genes were flanked by an orf (virulence plasmid protein), a partial orf (integrase), and dna sequences (bacteriophage integration site) characteristic of virulence-associated regions. these results provide evidence for a functional cdt in a human oral pathogen.

TI  == rapid identification and speciation of haemophilus bacteria by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == several species of the genus haemophilus are well known etiological agents of pneumonia, meningitis, conjunctivitis, epiglottitis and chancroid. however, identification and speciation of haemophilus is both time consuming and labor intensive. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi/tof-ms) has been used by several investigators to profile proteins from intact and disrupted bacteria; consequently, maldi/tof-ms has emerged as a powerful tool in diagnostic bacteriology. this paper reports the use of maldi/tof-ms as a technique for the rapid identification and speciation of haemophilus. this technique was used to not only identify the pathogen, h. ducreyi, but also to determine strain differences from different isolates. mass spectral 'fingerprints' were obtained which permitted the rapid speciation of not only pathogenic forms of haemophilus, but also those bacteria which are normally  regarded as non-pathogenic and members of the normal flora. maldi/tof mass spectra can be acquired in 10 min, allowing the identification of haemophilus spp. within 24 h rather than the 48 h or more needed for traditional bacteriological methods. in addition, these are the first mass spectral fingerprints available in the literature for many of these organisms.

TI  == the cell cycle-specific growth-inhibitory factor produced by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been shown to produce a soluble cytotoxic factor(s) distinct from leukotoxin. we have identified in a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 a cluster of genes encoding a cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). this new member of the cdt family is similar to the cdt produced by  haemophilus ducreyi. the cdt from a. actinomycetemcomitans was produced in escherichia coli and was able to induce cell distension, growth arrest in g2/m phase, nucleus swelling, and chromatin fragmentation in hela cells. the three proteins, cdta, -b and -c, encoded by the cdt locus were all required for toxin activity. antiserum raised against recombinant cdtc completely inhibited the cytotoxic activity of culture supernatant and cell homogenate fractions of a. actinomycetemcomitans y4. these results strongly suggest that the cdt is responsible for the cytotoxic activity present in the culture supernatant and cell homogenate fractions of a. actinomycetemcomitans y4. this cdt is a new putative virulence factor of a. actinomycetemcomitans and may play a role in the  pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
