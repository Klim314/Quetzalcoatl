TI  == non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis caused by non-hacek (species other than haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, or kingella species) gram-negative bacilli is rare, is poorly characterized, and is commonly considered to be primarily a disease of  injection drug users. objective: to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis in a large, international, contemporary cohort of patients. design: observations from  the international collaboration on infective endocarditis prospective cohort study (ice-pcs) database. setting: 61 hospitals in 28 countries. patients: hospitalized patients with definite endocarditis. measurements: characteristics of non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis cases were described and compared with those due to other pathogens. results: among the 2761 case-patients with definite endocarditis enrolled in ice-pcs, 49 (1.8%) had endocarditis (20 native valve, 29 prosthetic valve or device) due to non-hacek, gram-negative bacilli. escherichia coli (14 patients [29%]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 patients [22%]) were the most common pathogens. most patients (57%) with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis had health care-associated infection, whereas injection drug use was rare (4%). implanted endovascular devices were frequently associated with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis compared with other causes of endocarditis (29% vs. 11%; p < 0.001). the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with endocarditis due to non-hacek gram-negative bacilli was high (24%) despite high rates of cardiac surgery (51%). limitations: because of the small number of patients with non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis in each treatment group and the lack of long-term follow-up, strong treatment recommendations are difficult to make. conclusion: in this large, prospective, multinational cohort, more than one half of all cases of non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis were associated with health care contact. non-hacek gram-negative bacillus endocarditis is not primarily a disease of injection drug users.

TI  == the use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  == despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus aprophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, listeria monocytogenes. oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating s. aureus endocarditis. carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. the cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. there have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. they have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
