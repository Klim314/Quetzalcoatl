TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.
