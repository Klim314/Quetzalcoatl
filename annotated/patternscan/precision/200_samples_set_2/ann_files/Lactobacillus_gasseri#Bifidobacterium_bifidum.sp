TI  == lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm-2 ingestion induces a less inflammatory cytokine profile and a potentially beneficial shift in gut microbiota in older adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
AB  == objective: this study determined whether older adults who consumed a probiotic mixture would have a greater proportion of circulating cd4+ lymphocytes, altered  cytokine production, and a shift in intestinal microbiota toward a healthier microbial community. methods: participants (70 +/- 1 years [mean +/- sem]; n = 32) consumed a probiotic (lactobacillus gasseri ks-13, bifidobacterium bifidum g9-1, and bifidobacterium longum mm2) or a placebo twice daily for 3 weeks with a 5-week washout period between intervention periods. blood and stools were collected before and after each intervention. the percentage of circulating cd4+  lymphocytes and ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cytokine production were measured. in stools, specific bacterial targets were quantified via quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and community composition was determined via pyrosequencing. results: during the first period of the crossover the percentage  of cd4+ cells decreased with the placebo (48% +/- 3% to 31% +/- 3%, p < 0.01) but did not change with the probiotic (44% +/- 3% to 42% +/- 3%) and log-transformed  concentrations of interleukin-10 increased with the probiotic (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.0001) but not the placebo (1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2). with the probiotic versus the placebo a higher percentage of participants had an increase  in fecal bifidobacteria (48% versus 30%, p < 0.05) and lactic acid bacteria (55%  versus 43%, p < 0.05) and a decrease in escherichia coli (52% versus 27%, p < 0.05). several bacterial groups matching faeacalibactierium prausnitzii were more prevalent in stool samples with the probiotic versus placebo. conclusions: the probiotic maintained cd4+ lymphocytes and produced a less inflammatory cytokine profile possibly due to the changes in the microbial communities, which more closely resembled those reported in healthy younger populations.

TI  == interactions of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium with  gut bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the gut microbiota on the growth and survival of s. typhimurium. this was tested in two-species co-cultures and in mixed cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota. subsequently, interactions between s. typhimurium and human faecal bacteria were quantified in  both batch and continuous culture systems simulating the human colon. the exponential growth of s. typhimurium was halted when the population of escherichia coli reached the maximum population density in a two-compartment co-culture system where the two species were separated by a 0.45 mum pore membrane. furthermore, the growth of some gut bacteria such as lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium bifidum was inhibited by the presence of s. typhimurium in the other compartment. the survival of s. typhimurium was severely affected in mixed batch cultures with human faecal samples; a reduction of 10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml in the concentration of s. typhimurium was observed in these cultures. however, no effect on s. typhimurium survival was observed in mixed batch cultures with a simplified gut model microbiota under the same conditions.  the effect of human faecal samples on s. typhimurium in a three-stage continuous  culture was different to that obtained in batch cultures; its growth rather than  survival was affected under these conditions. s. typhimurium growth was inhibited, and the bacterium was therefore eliminated by the continuous flow of the medium. depending upon culturing conditions, the gut microbiota caused either growth inhibition, inactivation or did not affect s. typhimurium.

TI  == new screening methods for probiotics with adhesion properties to sialic acid and  sulphate residues in human colonic mucin using the biacore assay.
AB  == aims: to determine the relationship between adhesive ability of probiotics and acidic residues in human colonic mucin, we developed a new screening method using biacore to evaluate adherence of bacteria before and after sialic acid or sulphate residues were blocked or removed from mucin. methods and results: ten strains of lactobacilli and three strains of bifidobacteria isolated from human faeces were evaluated for their adhesive properties to soluble human colonic mucin (shcm) using the biacore binding assay. three strains (lactobacillus strain me-522, lact. gasseri me-527 and bifidobacterium bifidum mcc1092) showing significant adherence were selected. decreased binding activities were observed after removing sialic acid of shcm using sialidase. however, after removing the sulphate residue using sulphatase, the adhesion of me-527 decreased; whereas the  remaining two strains had increased adhesion. the adhesion of three probiotics significantly decreased after the sulphate residue was blocked by elution with barium chloride. conclusions: a new evaluation method using the biacore assay was developed to observe binding properties to the acidic residues of shcm. results indicated that there was a strong relationship between probiotic adhesion and acidic residues of shcm. significance and impact of the study: this is the first  report showing a screening method that quantitatively measures the binding between bacteria and acidic residues in shcm using the biacore binding assay; and provides a new method for the selection of probiotics in the future.

TI  == galacto-oligosaccharides have prebiotic activity in a dynamic in vitro colon model using a (13)c-labeling technique.
AB  == galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) are considered to be prebiotic, although the contribution of specific members of the microbiota to gos fermentation and the exact microbial metabolites that are produced upon gos fermentation are largely unknown. we aimed to determine this using uniformly (13)c-labeled gos. the normal (control) medium and unlabeled or (13)c-labeled gos was added to a dynamic, validated, in vitro model of the large-intestine containing an adult-type microbiota. liquid-chromatography ms was used to measure the incorporation of (13)c label into metabolites. 16s-rrna stable isotope probing coupled to a phylogenetic micro-array was used to determine label incorporation in microbial biomass. the primary members within the complex microbiota that were directly involved in gos fermentation were shown to be bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, lactobacillus gasseri, and l. salivarius, in line with the prebiotic effect of gos, although some other species incorporated (13)c label also. gos fermentation led to an increase in acetate (+49%) and lactate (+23%) compared with the control. total organic acid production was 8.50 and 7.52 mmol/g of carbohydrate fed for the gos and control experiments, respectively. at the same time, the cumulative production of putrefactive metabolites (branched-chain  fatty acids and ammonia) was reduced by 55%. cross-feeding of metabolites from primary gos fermenters to other members of the microbiota was observed. our findings support a prebiotic role for gos and its potential to act as a synbiotic in combination with certain probiotic strains.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == microencapsulation of a probiotic and prebiotic in alginate-chitosan capsules improves survival in simulated gastro-intestinal conditions.
AB  == chitosan was used as a coating material to improve encapsulation of a probiotic and prebiotic in calcium alginate beads. chitosan-coated alginate microspheres were produced to encapsulate lactobacillus gasseri (l) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b) as probiotics and the prebiotic quercetin (q) with the objective of enhancing survival of the probiotic bacteria and keeping intact the prebiotic during exposure to the adverse conditions of the gastro-intestinal tract. the encapsulation yield for viable cells for chitosan-coated alginate microspheres with quercetin (l+q and b+q) was very low. these results, together with the study about the survival of microspheres with quercetin during storage at 4 degrees c,  demonstrated that probiotic bacteria microencapsulated with quercetin did not survive. owing to this, quercetin and l. gasseri or b. bifidum were microencapsulated separately. microencapsulated l. gasseri and microencapsulated  b. bifidum were resistant to simulated gastric conditions (ph 2.0, 2h) and bile solution (3%, 2h), resulting in significantly (p<0.05) improved survival when compared with free bacteria. this work showed that the microencapsulation of l. gasseri and b. bifidum with alginate and a chitosan coating offers an effective means of delivery of viable bacterial cells to the colon and maintaining their survival during simulated gastric and intestinal juice.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == a differential medium for lactic acid-producing bacteria in a mixed culture.
AB  == aims: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue (mmrs-bpb) was tested as a medium for counting and differentiation of each lactic acid-producing bacterium (lab), especially in a mixed culture. methods and results: type strains of 10 lab species (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis, l. bulgaricus, l. gasseri, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. reuteri, weissella confusa, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. infantis) and five commercial yogurts were inoculated on plate count agar with bromocresol purple, mmrs, and mmrs-bpb.  each type strain showed more clearly formed colonies on the three media under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. especially each type strain produced colonies with specific characteristics of each species on mmrs-bpb. commercial yogurts produced the largest number of colonies with various shapes and colours on mmrs-bpb. conclusions: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue under anaerobic conditions is appropriate for counting and differentiating each lab in a mixed culture. significance and impact of the study: modified deman-rogosa sharpe agar containing bromophenol blue will  be useful in isolation and enumeration of each lab from fermented foods as well as intestinal microflora.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus gasseri pa 16/8, bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3, b. bifidum mf 20/5 on common cold episodes: a double blind, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  == background & aims: the aim of this study was to investigate whether the consumption of lactobacillus gasseri pa 16/8, bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3, b.  bifidum mf 20/5 (5 x 10(7) cfu/tablet) during at least 3 months influences the severity of symptoms and the incidence and duration of the common cold. methods:  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study was performed over at least 3 months during two winter/spring periods. four hundred and seventy nine healthy adults (aged 18-67) were supplemented daily with vitamins and minerals with or without the probiotic bacteria. cellular immune parameters were  evaluated in a randomly drawn subgroup of 122 volunteers before and after 14 days of supplementation. during common cold episodes, the participants recorded symptoms daily. stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of probiotic supplementation to quantify fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria using qrt-pcr. results: the total symptom score, the duration of common cold episodes,  and days with fever during an episode were lower in the probiotic-treated group than in the control group: 79.3+/-7.4 vs. 102.5+/-12.2 points (p = 0.056), 7.0+/-0.5 vs. 8.9+/-1.0 days (p = 0.045), 0.24+/-0.1 vs. 1.0+/-0.3 days (p = 0.017). a significantly higher enhancement of cytotoxic plus t suppressor cells (cd8+) and a higher enhancement of t helper cells (cd4+) was observed in the probiotic-treated group. fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly after probiotic supplementation. conclusions: the intake of probiotic bacteria during at least 3 months significantly shortened common cold episodes by almost 2 days and reduced the severity of symptoms.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
