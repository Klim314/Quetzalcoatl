TI  == structural basis for the inhibition of helicobacter pylori alpha-carbonic anhydrase by sulfonamides.
AB  == periplasmic alpha-carbonic anhydrase of helicobacter pylori (hpalphaca), an oncogenic bacterium in the human stomach, is essential for its acclimation to low ph. it catalyses the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate using zn(ii) as  the cofactor. in h. pylori, neisseria spp., brucella suis and streptococcus pneumoniae this enzyme is the target for sulfonamide antibacterial agents. we present structural analysis correlated with inhibition data, on the complexes of  hpalphaca with two pharmacological inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrases, acetazolamide and methazolamide. this analysis reveals that two sulfonamide oxygen atoms of the inhibitors are positioned proximal to the putative location of the oxygens of the co2 substrate in the michaelis complex, whilst the zinc-coordinating sulfonamide nitrogen occupies the position of the catalytic water molecule. the structures are consistent with acetazolamide acting as site-directed, nanomolar inhibitors of the enzyme by mimicking its reaction transition state. additionally, inhibitor binding provides insights into the channel for substrate entry and product exit. this analysis has implications for  the structure-based design of inhibitors of bacterial carbonic anhydrases.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == orientia, rickettsia, and leptospira pathogens as causes of cns infections in laos: a prospective study.
AB  == background: scrub typhus (caused by orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (caused by rickettsia typhi), and leptospirosis are common causes of febrile illness in asia; meningitis and meningoencephalitis are severe complications. however, scarce data exist for the burden of these pathogens in patients with cns disease in endemic countries. laos is representative of vast economically poor rural areas in asia with little medical information to guide public health policy. we assessed whether these pathogens are important causes of cns infections in laos. methods: between jan 10, 2003, and nov 25, 2011, we enrolled  1112 consecutive patients of all ages admitted with cns symptoms or signs requiring a lumbar puncture at mahosot hospital, vientiane, laos. microbiological examinations (culture, pcr, and serology) targeted so-called conventional bacterial infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, s suis) and o tsutsugamushi, rickettsia typhi/rickettsia  spp, and leptospira spp infections in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (csf). we analysed and compared causes and clinical and csf characteristics between patient groups. findings: 1051 (95%) of 1112 patients who presented had csf available for analysis, of whom 254 (24%) had a cns infection attributable to a bacterial or fungal pathogen. 90 (35%) of these 254 infections were caused by o tsutsugamushi, r typhi/rickettsia spp, or leptospira spp. these pathogens were significantly more frequent than conventional bacterial infections (90/1051 [9%] vs 42/1051 [4%]; p<0.0001) by use of conservative diagnostic definitions. cns infections had a high mortality (236/876 [27%]), with 18% (13/71) for r typhi/rickettsia spp, o  tsutsugamushi, and leptospira spp combined, and 33% (13/39) for conventional bacterial infections (p=0.076). interpretation: our data suggest that r typhi/rickettsia spp, o tsutsugamushi, and leptospira spp infections are important causes of cns infections in laos. antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, needed for the treatment of murine typhus and scrub typhus, are not routinely advised for empirical treatment of cns infections. these severely neglected infections represent a potentially large proportion of treatable cns disease burden across vast endemic areas and need more attention. funding: wellcome trust uk.

TI  == heat incubation inactivates streptococcal exotoxins and recombinant cholesterol-dependent cytolysins: suilysin, pneumolysin and streptolysin o.
AB  == streptococcus species release cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs), which are  a main toxin, and their heat susceptibility is poorly understood. the aim of this study was to clarify the heat susceptibility of streptococcal exotoxins and cdcs. streptococcal exotoxins were treated with heat incubation at 60 degrees c for 10  or 30 min. the streptococcus suis exotoxin of serotypes 1 and 2 exhibited more than 50 % haemolytic activity, and all streptococcus pneumoniae exotoxins exhibited more than 60 % haemolytic activity. during the thermolabile assay, the  virulent streptococcal haemolytic activity remarkably decreased after being heated at 60 degrees c for 10 m. then, streptococcal recombinant cdcs were produced and put through a thermolabile assay. the haemolytic activity of suilysin (sly), pneumolysin (ply) and streptolysin o (slo) decreased more than 80 % after heat incubation. we also conducted a ter assay to evaluate the cell monolayer. the cell monolayer of all cdcs broke down, and the fitc-dextran translocated at 1 h post addition, while the cdcs treated with heating did not induce cell disruption. moreover, the microscopy analysis demonstrated that cdcs  treated with heating lost their activity. in conclusion, heat incubation induced  the inactivation of streptococcal exotoxins and cdcs. heat incubation plays a role in the degradation of the streptococcal exotoxin, and this result applies to the inhibition of streptococcal infection.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == the beta-galactosidase (bgac) of the zoonotic pathogen streptococcus suis is a surface protein without the involvement of bacterial virulence.
AB  == streptococcal pathogens have evolved to express exoglycosidases, one of which is  bgac beta-galactosidase, to deglycosidate host surface glycolconjucates with exposure of the polysaccharide receptor for bacterial adherence. the paradigm bgac protein is the bgac product of streptococcus, a bacterial surface-exposed beta-galactosidase. here we report the functional definition of the bgac homologue from an epidemic chinese strain 05zyh33 of the zoonotic pathogen streptococcus suis. bioinformatics analyses revealed that s. suis bgac shared the conserved active sites (w240, w243 and y454). the recombinant bgac protein of s.  suis was purified to homogeneity. enzymatic assays confirmed its activity of beta-galactosidase. also, the hydrolysis activity was found to be region-specific and sugar-specific for the gal beta-1,3-glcnac moiety of oligosaccharides. flow cytometry analyses combined with immune electron microscopy demonstrated that s.  suis bgac is an atypical surface-anchored protein in that it lacks the "lpxtg" motif for typical surface proteins. integrative evidence from cell lines and mice-based experiments showed that an inactivation of bgac does not significantly impair the ability of neither adherence nor anti-phagocytosis, and consequently failed to attenuate bacterial virulence, which is somewhat similar to the scenario seen with s. pneumoniae. therefore we concluded that s. suis bgac is an  atypical surface-exposed protein without the involvement of bacterial virulence.

TI  == the use of dried cerebrospinal fluid filter paper spots as a substrate for pcr diagnosis of the aetiology of bacterial meningitis in the lao pdr.
AB  == we investigated whether dried cerebrospinal fluid (csf) conserved on filter paper can be used as a substrate for accurate pcr diagnosis of important causes of bacterial meningitis in the lao pdr. using mock csf, we investigated and optimized filter paper varieties, paper punch sizes, elution volumes and quantities of dna template to achieve sensitive and reliable detection of bacterial dna from filter paper specimens. fta elute micro card (whatman, maidstone, uk) was the most sensitive, consistent and practical variety of filter paper. following optimization, the lower limit of detection for streptococcus pneumoniae from dried mock csf spots was 14 genomic equivalents (ge)/mul (interquartile range 5.5 ge/mul) or 230 (iqr 65) colony forming units/ml. a prospective clinical evaluation for s. pneumoniae, s. suis and neisseria meningitidis was performed. culture and pcr performed on fresh liquid csf from patients admitted with a clinical diagnosis of meningitis (n = 73) were compared  with results derived from dried csf spots. four of five fresh pcr-positive csf samples also tested pcr positive from dried csf spots, with one patient under the limit of detection. in a retrospective study of s. pneumoniae samples (n = 20), the median (iqr; range) csf s. pneumoniae bacterial load was 1.1 x 10(4) ge/mul (1.2 x 10(5) ; 1 to 6.1 x 10(6) dna ge/mul). utilizing the optimized methodology, we estimate an extrapolated sensitivity of 90%, based on the range of csf genome  counts found in laos. dried csf filter paper spots could potentially help us to better understand the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in resource-poor settings and guide empirical treatments and vaccination policies.

TI  == identification and characterization of a new cell surface protein possessing factor h-binding activity in the swine pathogen and zoonotic agent streptococcus  suis.
AB  == streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. the  ability of pathogenic bacteria to bind the complement regulator factor h on their cell surface may allow them to avoid complement attack and phagocytosis. the aim  of this study was to characterize a new cell surface protein possessing factor h-binding activity in s. suis serotype 2. the capacity of s. suis to bind the complement regulator factor h on its surface was demonstrated by elisa. using a factor i-cofactor assay, it was found that the functional activity of factor h bound to s. suis was kept. since the product of gene ssu0186 in s. suis p1/7 shared similarity with a streptococcus pneumoniae protein (named pspc) possessing factor h-binding activity, it was proposed as a putative factor h receptor in s.  suis. ssu0186 has a 1686 bp open reading frame encoding a 561 amino acid protein  containing the gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (lpxtg) at the carboxy-terminal, an amino-terminal signal sequence, an alpha-helix domain, a proline-rich region and a g5 domain. the ssu0186 gene was cloned in escherichia coli and the purified recombinant factor h-binding protein showed a molecular mass of 95 kda, as determined by sds-page. the protein possessed the functional property of binding factor h. sera from s. suis-infected pigs reacted with the recombinant factor h receptor, suggesting that it is produced during the course of infections. in conclusion, we identified a novel s. suis cell surface protein  that binds the complement factor h. this cell surface protein may help s. suis to resist complement attack and phagocytosis and contribute to pathogenesis.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  == streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. among them, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis are discussed here. an environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (tcs), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding rnas are the topic  of this chapter. the regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.

TI  == an octamer of enolase from streptococcus suis.
AB  == enolase is a conserved cytoplasmic metalloenzyme existing universally in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. the enzyme can also locate on the cell surface  and bind to plasminogen, via which contributing to the mucosal surface localization of the bacterial pathogens and assisting the invasion into the host  cells. the functions of the eukaryotic enzymes on the cell surface expression (including t cells, b cells, neutrophils, monocytoes, neuronal cells and epithelial cells) are not known. streptococcus suis serotype 2 (s. suis 2, ss2) is an important zoonotic pathogen which has recently caused two large-scale outbreaks in southern china with severe streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss) never seen before in human sufferers. we recently identified the ss2 enolase as an important protective antigen which could protect mice from fatal s.suis 2 infection. in this study, a 2.4-angstrom structure of the ss2 enolase is solved,  revealing an octameric arrangement in the crystal. we further demonstrated that the enzyme exists exclusively as an octamer in solution via a sedimentation assay. these results indicate that the octamer is the biological unit of ss2 enolase at least in vitro and most likely in vivo as well. this is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive characterization of the ss2 enolase octamer both structurally and biophysically, and the second octamer enolase structure in  addition to that of streptococcus pneumoniae. we also investigated the plasminogen binding property of the ss2 enzyme.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == the spectrum of central nervous system infections in an adult referral hospital in hanoi, vietnam.
AB  == objectives: to determine prospectively the causative pathogens of central nervous system (cns) infections in patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in hanoi, vietnam. methods: from may 2007 to december 2008, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples from 352 adults with suspected meningitis or encephalitis underwent routine testing, staining (gram, ziehl-nielsen, india ink), bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction targeting neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis, haemophilus influenzae type b, herpes simplex virus (hsv), varicella zoster virus (vzv), enterovirus, and 16s ribosomal rna. blood cultures  and clinically indicated radiology were also performed. patients were classified  as having confirmed or suspected bacterial (bm), tuberculous (tbm), cryptococcal  (crm), eosinophilic (eom) meningitis, aseptic encephalitis/meningitis (aem), neurocysticercosis and others. results: 352 (male: 66%) patients were recruited:  median age 34 years (range 13-85). 95/352 (27.3%) diagnoses were laboratory confirmed and one by cranial radiology: bm (n = 62), tbm (n = 9), aem (n = 19), crm (n = 5), and neurocysticercosis (n = 1, cranial radiology). s. suis predominated as the cause of bm [48/62 (77.4%)]; listeria monocytogenese (n = 1), s. pasteurianus (n = 1) and n. meningitidis (n = 2) were infrequent. aem viruses  were: hsv (n = 12), vzv (n = 5) and enterovirus (n = 2). 5 patients had eom. of 262/352 (74.4%) patients with full clinical data, 209 (79.8%) were hospital referrals and 186 (71%) had been on antimicrobials. 21 (8%) patients died: tbm (15.2%), aem (10%), and bm (2.8%). conclusions: most infections lacked microbiological confirmation. s. suis was the most common cause of bm in this setting. improved diagnostics are needed for meningoencephalitic syndromes to inform treatment and prevention strategies.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcus suis tet(o/w/32/o)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. they may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. in the genus streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(o/w/32/o)] was first discovered in streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. in this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(o/w/32/o) gene-carrying mobile element from an s. suis isolate. tet(o/w/32/o) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% g+c; 17 open reading frames [orfs] identified). the novel element, which we designated 15k, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(b) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aade (streptomycin) and  apha (kanamycin). 15k appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. in the integrated form, 15k was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ice) (50.5% g+c; 55 orfs), which we designated icessu32457. an approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15k element was identified. the novel ice was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic streptococcus species (s. suis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15k element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.

TI  == future challenges in the elimination of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == despite the widespread implementation of several effective vaccines over the past few decades, bacterial meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and group b streptococcus (gbs) still results  in unacceptably high levels of human mortality and morbidity. a residual disease  burden due to bacterial meningitis is also apparent due to a number of persistent or emerging pathogens, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp. and streptococcus suis. here, we review the current status of bacterial meningitis caused by these pathogens, highlighting how past and present vaccination programs have attempted to counter  these pathogens. we discuss how improved pathogen surveillance, implementation of current vaccines, and development of novel vaccines may be expected to further reduce bacterial meningitis and related diseases in the future.

TI  == streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant animal and human pathogen.
AB  == streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the s.  suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. the available information strongly suggests that s. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. s. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.

AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  == carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria  encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in  the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of  these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and  s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == real-time pcr for detection of streptococcus suis serotype 2 in cerebrospinal fluid of human patients with meningitis.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an emerging zoonotic pathogen and is the main cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adult patients in vietnam. we developed an internally controlled real-time pcr for detection of s. suis serotype 2 in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples targeted at the cps2j gene. sensitivity and specificity in culture-confirmed clinical samples were 100%. the pcr detected s.  suis serotype 2 infection in 101 of 238 (42.4%) prospectively collected csf samples, of which 55 (23%) were culture positive. culture-negative but pcr-positive csf samples were significantly associated with the use of antimicrobial agents before admission. s. suis serotype 2 infection was more common than infections with streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria meningitidis combined. our results strikingly illustrate the additional diagnostic value of pcr in patients who are pretreated with antimicrobial agents and demonstrate the  extremely high prevalence of s. suis infections among vietnamese adult patients with bacterial meningitis.

TI  == expression of plectasin in pichia pastoris and its characterization as a new antimicrobial peptide against staphyloccocus and streptococcus.
AB  == recombinant plectasin, the first fungus defensin, was expressed in pichia pastoris and purified, and its physical, chemical and antimicrobial characteristics were studied. following a 120 h induction of recombinant yeast, the amount of total secreted protein reached 748.63 mug/ml. the percentage of recombinant plectasin was estimated to be 71.79% of the total protein. after purification with a sephadex g-25 column and rp-hplc, the identity of plectasin was verified by maldi-tof ms. plectasin exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria staphyloccocusaureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis. at a concentration of 2560 mug/ml, this peptide showed approximately equal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. suis, and s. pneumoniae, when compared to 320 mug/ml vancomycin, 640 mug/ml penicillin, 320 mug/ml vancomycin and 160 mug/ml vancomycin, respectively. in addition, plectasin showed anti-s. aureus activity over a wide ph range of 2.0 and 10.0, a high thermal stability at 100 degrees c for 1h and remarkable resistance to papain and pepsin. the expression and characterization of recombinant plectasin in p. pastoris has potential to treat streptococcus and staphyloccocus infections when most traditional antibiotics show no effect on them. our results indicate that plectasin can be produced in large quantities, and that it has pharmaceutical importance for the prevention and clinical treatment of staphyloccocus and streptococcus infections.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == identification, variation and transcription of pneumococcal repeat sequences.
AB  == background: small interspersed repeats are commonly found in many bacterial chromosomes. two families of repeats (box and rup) have previously been identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae, a nasopharyngeal commensal  and respiratory pathogen of humans. however, little is known about the role they  play in pneumococcal genetics. results: analysis of the genome of s. pneumoniae atcc 700669 revealed the presence of a third repeat family, which we have named sprite. all three repeats are present at a reduced density in the genome of the closely related species s. mitis. however, they are almost entirely absent from all other streptococci, although a set of elements related to the pneumococcal box repeat was identified in the zoonotic pathogen s. suis. in conjunction with information regarding their distribution within the pneumococcal chromosome, this suggests that it is unlikely that these repeats are specialised sequences performing a particular role for the host, but rather that they constitute parasitic elements. however, comparing insertion sites between pneumococcal sequences indicates that they appear to transpose at a much lower rate than is elements. some large box elements in s. pneumoniae were found to encode open reading frames on both strands of the genome, whilst another was found to form a  composite rna structure with two t box riboswitches. in multiple cases, such box  elements were demonstrated as being expressed using directional rna-seq and rt-pcr. conclusions: box, rup and sprite repeats appear to have proliferated extensively throughout the pneumococcal chromosome during the species' past, but  novel insertions are currently occurring at a relatively slow rate. through their extensive secondary structures, they seem likely to affect the expression of genes with which they are co-transcribed. software for annotation of these repeats is freely available from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/strep_repeats/.

TI  == htps, a novel immunogenic cell surface-exposed protein of streptococcus suis, confers protection in mice.
AB  == streptococcal histidine triad protein was identified recently as a cell surface-associated protein family. five members of this family (phta, phtb, phtd, phte and htpa), derived from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, have been shown as antigens that confer protection to the host on infection. in this report, a gene sequence highly homologous to htpa and phtd (designated htps, the histidine triad protein of streptococcus suis) was identified from s. suis 2  chinese strain 05zyh33. our data revealed that htps is extremely conserved in s.  suis 2 and widely distributed in 83% (29/35) of 35 s. suis serotypes. it was also demonstrated by western blot and flow cytometry that htps is a cell surface-associated protein that was expressed during s. suis 2 infection. an antibody against htps could increase the deposition of human complement 3 on s. suis 2 and also enhance the clearance of s. suis 2 in whole blood. in addition, mice could be immunized against s. suis 2 infection and were well protected after immunization with recombinant htps.

TI  == carbonic anhydrase inhibition/activation: trip of a scientist around the world in the search of novel chemotypes and drug targets.
AB  == carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze co(2) hydration to bicarbonate and protons. five genetically distinct classes are known, which represent an excellent example of convergent evolution. inhibition of alpha-cas from vertebrates, including humans, with sulfonamides was exploited  clinically for decades for various classes of diuretics and systemically acting antiglaucoma agents, whereas newer inhibitors are used as topically acting antiglaucoma drugs, anticonvulsants, antiobesity, antipain and antitumor agents/diagnostic tools. recently, novel interesting chemotypes, in addition to the sulfonamides and sulfamates were discovered, such as the phenols, coumarins/thiocoumarins/lacosamide, fullerenes, boronic acids and some protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. furthermore, their detailed mechanism of inhibition has been explained and can be used for the rational drug design of other agents.  such new classes of enzyme inhibitors show promise for designing interesting pharmacological agents and understanding in detail protein-drug interactions at molecular level. cas belonging to the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta- and zeta-families found in many organisms all over the phylogenetic tree and their inhibition were studied ultimately in nematodes, corals, some pathogenic protozoa (plasmodium falciparum), fungi/yeasts (cryptococcus neoformans, candida albicans, c. glabrata, saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria (helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella suis, streptococcus pneumoniae), being demonstrated that anti-infectives based on their inhibitors might be obtained. possible applications for these new chemotypes are envisaged and discussed in detail, based on a chemo-geographical approach which took the author around the world and the chemical space.

TI  == structure determination of streptococcus suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  == the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of streptococcus suis serotype 2 was isolated,  purified, chemically modified, and characterized. sugar and absolute configuration analyses of the cps gave the following composition: d-gal, 3; d-glc, 1; d-glcnac, 1; d-neu5ac, 1; l-rha, 1. sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the cps was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. the cps was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and smith degradation. sugar and methylation analysis, 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native cps or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence:  [4)[neu5ac(alpha2-6)gal(beta1-4)glcnac(beta1-3)]gal(beta1-4)[gal(alpha1-3)]rha(be ta1-4)glc(beta1-]n. the backbone sequence was found to be identical to that of streptococcus agalactiae or group b streptococcus (gbs) type viii and streptococcus pneumoniae type 23f. the s. suis cps shares the sequence neu5ac-gal-glcnac-gal in common with gbs types ia, ib, ii, iii, and iv cpss but differs from them by the presence of rhamnose and the fact that sialic acid is 2,6- rather than 2,3-linked to the following gal. a correlation between the s. suis cps sequence and genes of the serotype 2 cps locus encoding putative enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == identification and characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis type 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases. although many virulent factors have been identified and studied, relatively little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2. the aim of the study was to identify and understand the characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh). a 957-bp gene, impdh, was identified in the virulent s. suis serotype 2 (ss2), and analysis of the predicted impdh sequence revealed imp  dehydrogenase/gmp reductase domain. the gene encoding for the impdh of s. suis was cloned and sequenced. the dna sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 318 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 23% sequence identity with the impdh from streptococcus pyogenes (yp281355) and streptococcus pneumoniae (zp00404150). using the pet(32) expression plasmid, the impdh gene was inducibly  overexpressed in escherichia coli to produce impdh with a hexahistidyl n-terminus to permit its purification. the (his)6 impdh protein was found to possess functional impdh enzymatic activity after the purification. the impdh-knockout ss2 mutant ( delta impdh) constructed in this study was slower in growth and one  ph unit higher than ss2-h after 6 h of culturing, and found to be attenuated in mouse models of infection for 2.5 times and not be capable of causing death in porcine models of infection in contrast with the parent ss2-h.

AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 (s. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that  can cause severe disease and even death in both humans and swine. no effective vaccine is clinically available. in this study, a reverse vaccinology method was  first applied to identify protective antigens against s. suis 2. as a consequence, 153 genes encoding vaccine candidates were selected from the whole genome sequence by means of bioinformatics analysis, from which 10 genes were selected based on experimental evidences arising from the study of related bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, group b streptococcus, s. suis and so  on. of 10 target genes, 8 were successfully expressed in escherichia coli rosetta, and expressed proteins were purified and used as the immunogens for evaluating vaccine efficacy in a mouse infection model. the results have confirmed that rtx family exoprotein a (rfea), epidermal surface antigen (esa), immunoglobulin g (igg)-binding protein (ibp), and suilysin (sly) can induce a protective response of the vaccinated animals against s. suis 2, whereas rfea, esa, and ibp mainly induce humoral-mediated immunity, and sly elicits a combined  pattern of both humoral- and cellular-mediated immunity. although immunoprotection of sly against s. suis 2 was reported previously, rfea, esa, and ibp were explored first in this study.

TI  == structural basis of the zinc- and terbium-mediated inhibition of ferroxidase activity in dps ferritin-like proteins.
AB  == streptococcus suis dpr is an iron-binding protein involved in oxidative stress resistance. it belongs to the bacterial dps protein family whose members form dodecameric assemblies. previous studies have shown that zinc and terbium inhibit iron incorporation in listeria innocua dps protein. in order to gain structural insights into the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium, the crystal structures of streptococcus suis dpr complexes with these ions were determined at 1.8 a and  2.1 a, respectively. both ions were found to bind at the ferroxidase center and in the same location as iron. in addition, a novel zinc-binding site formed by his40 and his44 was identified. both his residues were found to be present within all known streptococcus suis dpr variants and in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus sanguinis dpr proteins. amino acid sequence alignment of dpr with other dps family members revealed that his44 is highly conserved, in contrast to his40. the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium on iron oxidation in dpr was studied in vitro, and it was found that both ions at concentrations >0.2 mm almost completely abolish iron binding. these results provide a structural basis for the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium in the dps family of proteins, and suggest a potential role of the dps proteins in zinc  detoxification mechanisms involving the second zinc-binding site.

TI  == streptococcus suis meningitis in adults in vietnam.
AB  == background: streptococcus suis infection is an emerging zoonosis in asia. we determined the detailed epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of s. suis meningitis in adults. methods: we prospectively studied 450 patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. four hundred thirty-five (96.7%) of the patients participated in a trial to determine the effect of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment. for patients with s. suis infection, bacterial dna load at hospital admission and during treatment was analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid specimens using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. s. suis strains were characterized using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. putative virulence factors, including extracellular protein factor, suilysin, and muramidase released protein, were detected using polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay. predictors of outcome were identified using logistic regression analysis. results: s. suis was the most common pathogen and was detected in 151 (33.6%) of  the patients. fifty (33.1%) of these 151 patients reported exposure to pigs or pork. mortality was low (2.6%; 4 of 151 patients died), but mild to severe hearing loss occurred in 93 (66.4%) of 140 patients. severe deafness at hospital  discharge was associated with age >50 years (odds ratio, 3.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-11.6), a strain carrying the epf gene (odds ratio, 3.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-11.4), and dexamethasone therapy (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.78) but was not associated with cerebrospinal fluid bacterial dna load. bacterial dna was still detectable in 58 (63%) of 92 cerebrospinal fluid samples after 6-10 days of antimicrobial treatment. ninety-one of 92 s. suis strains had serotype 2. thirty-three (36%) of these epidemiologically unrelated strains belonged to 1 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis cluster of multilocus sequence type 1, indicating clonal spread.  conclusion: s. suis serotype 2 is the most frequent cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in southern vietnam and is associated with substantial morbidity attributable to hearing loss.

TI  == structure, regulation, and putative function of the arginine deiminase system of  streptococcus suis.
AB  == streptococcus suis is an important cause of infectious diseases in young pigs. little is known about the virulence factors or protective antigens of s. suis. recently, we have identified two proteins of the arginine deiminase system (ads)  of s. suis, which were temperature induced and expressed on the streptococcal surface (n. winterhoff, r. goethe, p. gruening, m. rohde, h. kalisz, h. e. smith, and p. valentin-weigand, j. bacteriol. 184:6768-6776, 2002). in the present study, we analyzed the complete ads of s. suis. due to their homologies to the recently published s. gordonii ads genes, the genes for arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyl-transferase, and carbamate kinase, which were previously designated adis, octs, and cks, respectively, were renamed arca, arcb, and arcc,  respectively. our data revealed that arca, arcb, and arcc of the s. suis ads are  transcribed from an operon (arcabc operon). additionally, putative ads-associated genes were cloned and sequenced which, however, did not belong to the arcabc operon. these were the flps gene upstream of the arcabc operon with homology to the flp transcription regulator of s. gordonii and the arcd, arct, arch, and argr genes downstream of the arcabc operon with high homologies to a putative arginine-ornithine antiporter, a putative dipeptidase of s. gordonii, a putative  beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase of s. pneumoniae, and a putative arginine repressor of s. gordonii, respectively. the transcriptional start point of the arcabc operon was determined, and promoter analysis provided evidence that multiple factors contribute to the regulation of the ads. thus, a putative binding site for a transcription regulator of the crp/fnr family, an argr-binding site, and two cis-acting catabolite response elements were identified in the promoter-operator region of the operon. consistent with this, we could demonstrate that the ads of s. suis is inducible by arginine and reduced o2 tension and subject to carbon catabolite repression. furthermore, comparing an arca knockout mutant in which expression of the three operon-encoded proteins was abolished with the parental wild-type strain showed that the arcabc operon of s.  suis contributes to survival under acidic conditions.

AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.

TI  == streptococcus suis infection: clinical features and diagnostic pitfalls.
AB  == eight cases of streptococcus suis (s. suis) infection between 1993-1999 were retrospectively studied. there were 6 cases of meningitis and 2 cases of endocarditis. acute meningitis with early sensorineural hearing loss was the characteristic feature and the most common presentation of s. suis infection. s.  suis endocarditis is a rare presentation in thailand. this organism was often mistaken for streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus viridans. in this study, this was true in five cases in whom s. suis was identified later. however, the rapid diagnosis of s. suis meningitis may rely on gram stain of the csf in the setting of acute meningitis with hearing loss. these cases were treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin with a mean duration of 4 weeks. this treatment was very effective and there was no relapse among these patients.

TI  == adult community acquired bacterial meningitis in a singaporean teaching hospital. a seven-year overview (1993-2000).
AB  == background: the objective of this study is to describe the bacteriological, clinical and laboratory features of community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults admitted to a singapore tertiary-care hospital. methods: two hundred sixty-nine cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis admitted between 1993 and 2000 were identified by their discharge diagnosis codes. all case records except  for 57 which could not be retrieved were retrospectively reviewed. patients less  than 14 years or with skull fractures, post-neurosurgery or with indwelling intracranial devices were excluded. inclusion criteria was a clinical picture compatible with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with either (1) positive cerebral-spinal fluid (csf) cultures or latex coagglutination or csf neutrophilic pleocytosis accompanied by positive blood cultures or (2) in the absence of positive blood cultures, csf cultures and latex agglutination, presence of csf pleocytosis of at least 100 neutrophils per microl. results: fifteen "culture-positive" and 11 "culture negative" cases were identified. six (55%) of  the "culture-negative" cases received antibiotics prior to admission. cultures grew streptococcus pneumoniae in four cases, three cases each of group b streptococci and neisseria meningitides. listeria monocytogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae were each seen twice and streptococcus suis once. all cases of group b streptococci occurred in the year 1998. mortality was 19% (n = 5), six developed  infections in other sites, three epileptic seizures, three developed hydrocephalus, and two hearing loss. conclusions: pathogens are similar to those  reported in other studies but for an outbreak of group b streptococcus in 1998. there were a high number of "culture-negative" cases which may be due to preceding antibiotic intervention.

TI  == distribution of environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis serotype 2  among s. suis serotypes and other organisms.
AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (cps) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. in the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. the capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the cp of streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. a more complex situation has been found in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. on the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of  worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. this concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus c-terminal motif, leu-pro-x-thr-gly (lpxtg). this sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. using the type strain of streptococcus suis, nctc 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. one gene, designated  srta, was linked to gyra, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. three genes, designated srtb, srtc, and srtd, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. the remaining gene, designated srte, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus, except that srta of s. suis had 65% identity with that of s. gordonii. isogenic mutants deficient for srta, srtbcd, or srte were generated by allelic exchanges. the protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with n-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. more than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srta mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srta cloned from s. suis. four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. the deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the lpxtg motif in their c-terminal regions. on the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srta mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtbcd and srte mutants. these results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srta is also present in s. suis.

TI  == prevalence and mechanism of resistance against macrolides and lincosamides in streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  == eighty-seven streptococcus suis isolates recovered in 1999-2000 from diseased pigs, all from different farms, were screened for resistance against macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics by the disk diffusion and agar dilution test and a pcr assay, amplifying the ermb gene and the mefa/e gene. seventy-one percent of the isolates showed constitutive resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics (mls(b)-phenotype). all these isolates were positive for the ermb gene in the pcr, but negative for the mefa/e gene. for all strains minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against five other antimicrobial agents were determined. all strains were susceptible to penicillin. ninety-nine percent of the isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin and tiamulin. eighty-five percent of the strains were resistant to doxycycline. a 540bp fragment of the ermb genes  of eight s. suis strains was sequenced and compared with ermb genes of five s. pneumoniae and five s. pyogenes strains of human origin. a 100% homology was found between these fragments in seven s. suis, one s. pneumoniae and three of the s. pyogenes isolates. this study demonstrates that resistance against macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b is widespread in s. suis and mediated by ribosome methylation, encoded by the ermb gene.

TI  == a case-control study of respiratory disease in thoroughbred racehorses in sydney, australia.
AB  == in order to investigate the role of infectious agents in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract disease in thoroughbred racehorses, a matched case-control study was conducted. cases were identified by the presence of coughing, and were  compared to a control population matched on time of sample collection and location within the same training establishment. tracheal wash samples were collected from 100 cases and 148 controls. case horses were more likely than controls to have endoscopic and cytological evidence of airway inflammation. there was no significant association between serological evidence of infection by commonly implicated respiratory viruses and coughing. similarly, mycoplasma were  rarely isolated and were not associated with disease. in contrast, there was a strong association between isolation of greater than a total of 10(3) colony-forming units/ml of tracheal wash and coughing. individual bacterial species associated with disease included streptococcus zooepidemicus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus suis, streptococcus sanguis, pasteurella  spp and bordetella bronchiseptica. this study provides evidence of the role of bacterial infection in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract inflammation in racehorses. however, in 58% of cases, few or no bacteria were isolated. hence, at the time of identification of disease, there was no evidence of viral, bacterial  or mycoplasmal infection in the majority of coughing horses. the aetiology of the signs observed in these horses requires further investigation.

TI  == construction and characterization of streptococcus suis-escherichia coli shuttle  cloning vectors.
AB  == pssu1, a native plasmid of streptococcus suis dat1, was used to construct pset-series shuttle vectors. in addition to the replication function of pssu1, these vectors contain the multiple cloning sites and lacz' gene from puc19, which means that x-gal screening can be used to select recombinants in escherichia coli. pset1, pset2, and pset3 carry cat, spc, and both of these genes, respectively, as selectable markers. these vectors could be introduced into s. suis, e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, s. pneumoniae, and s. equi ssp. equi by electrotransformation. the reca gene was cloned from s. suis and sequenced, and this information was used in the construction of a reca mutant of s. suis. transformation frequencies and/or plasmid stability of all pset vectors tested were decreased in both s. suis and e. coli reca mutants compared with the parental strains. these results suggested that functional reca protein improved the maintenance of pset vectors in both s. suis and e. coli. moreover, cloning of the functional s. suis reca gene into pset2 and complementation analysis of the reca mutant were successful in s. suis but not in e. coli. these results showed that pset vectors are useful tools for cloning and analyzing s. suis genes in s.  suis strains directly.

TI  == evidence for horizontal transfer of ssudat1i restriction-modification genes to the streptococcus suis genome.
AB  == different strains of streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (r-m) system or lacked it. the r-m system was an isoschizomer of streptococcus pneumoniae dpnii, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-gatc-3'. the nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the r-m system in s. suis dat1, designated ssudat1i, showed that the ssudat1i gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuma and ssumb, as does the dpnii system. the deduced amino acid sequences of m. ssuma and m.ssumb showed 70 and 90% identity to m.dpnii and m.dpna, respectively. however, the ssudat1i system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssura and ssurb. the deduced amino acid sequence of r.ssura was 49% identical to that of r.dpnii, and r.ssurb was 72% identical to r.lladchi of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris dch-4. the four ssudat1i genes overlapped and  were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purf-purm-purn-purh-ssuma-ssumb-ssura++ +-ssurb-purd-pure. the g+c content of the ssudat1i gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the ssudat1i system. no transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. the ssudat1i genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in escherichia coli. comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the r-m system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuma to 5 bp downstream of ssurb was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purh and purd and that the  insertion target site was not the recognition site of ssudat1i. no notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. these results suggest that the ssudat1i system could have  been integrated into the s. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.

TI  == characterisation of the gene encoding suilysin from streptococcus suis and expression in field strains.
AB  == the gene encoding suilysin was cloned from streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain p1/7. analysis of the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence confirmed suilysin to be a member of the thiol activated cytolysin group (tacy). the pneumolysin from streptococcus pneumoniae is the most closely related orthologous gene known. suilysin was overexpressed in e. coli in an active haemolytic form. a strong correlation between the presence of the sly gene and haemolytic activity in the supernatant of s. suis field strains was found. of 158 strains tested, 63% contained the gene. within the (most prevalent) serotype 2, the sly gene was demonstrated in 95% of the strains isolated in eurasia, but only in 7% of the strains from north america.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
