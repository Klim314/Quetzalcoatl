TI  == in vitro activities of a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone, garenoxacin, against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of garenoxacin and eight other antibiotics against 641 anaerobic isolates were evaluated with the nccls agar dilution method. overall, the mics of garenoxacin for 50 and 90% of the strains tested (in micrograms per milliliter) were as follows: bacteroides fragilis group, 0.5 and 2; prevotella spp., 0.25 and 2; fusobacterium spp., 0.25 and 0.5; porphyromonas spp., 0.125 and 0.25; bilophila wadsworthia, 0.5 and 1; veillonella spp., 0.25 and 0.5; clostridium spp., 0.25 and 1; clostridium difficile, 2 and >64; bifidobacterium spp., 1 and 2; eggerthella lenta, 0.25 and 1; propionibacterium spp., 0.5 and 0.5; gram-positive cocci, 0.125 and 0.25.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == in vitro activity of telithromycin (hmr 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in a previous study, we compared hmr 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using nccls-approved procedures. this report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (hmr 3647) against these strains. telithromycin inhibited 10% of bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other b. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other bacteroides spp. telithromycin inhibited all porphyromonas spp.  and 98% of prevotella spp. activity against bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. telithromycin was not active against the fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. telithromycin inhibited 100% of clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of clostridium difficile and clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of  non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activity of du-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of a new quinolone agent, du-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of du-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin,  metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. du-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every  group of organisms. mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis (57), other b. fragilis group species (84), bilophila wadsworthia (15), clostridium species (27) (including c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum), fusobacterium nucleatum (16), fusobacterium mortiferum-f. varium group species (10), peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and prevotella species (25).
