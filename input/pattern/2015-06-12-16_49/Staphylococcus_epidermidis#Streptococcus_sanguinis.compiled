TI  - Platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  - Platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. Platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, FcgammaRII, Toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as GPIIb-IIIa or GPIb. Bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement C1q, the von Willebrand Factor, etc. The fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. Several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. Are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? Indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on S. aureus. Besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for Streptococcus sanguinis, S. epidermidis, or C. pneumoniae. On the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. We, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. Moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. Indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. In conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  - Abstract Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. Materials and methods. The growth of selected bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. The content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with HPLC-ESI-MS. Results. The spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. Sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. Total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with pH varying between 4.1-5.4. Conclusions. The present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice pH explains bacterial in vitro growth. This may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.
TI  - Introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  - Peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. They are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. New implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. The aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-N-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (VP:DMMEP 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. With a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. In contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. These data confirm the hypothesis that VP:DMMEP 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Collagen barrier membranes may accelerate bacterial growth in vitro: a potential  clinical risk to regenerative procedures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the antibacterial properties of three commercial collagen membranes for guided bone regeneration (GBR). METHOD AND MATERIALS: BioGide(R), OsseoGuard(R), and CopiOs(R) membranes were tested for antibacterial properties against Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a direct contact test (DCT). Samples of each membrane, sized 5 x 2 mm, were fixed to the side wall of 6 wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. Bacterial suspension was placed on each sample. The plate was incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 hour to allow suspension fluid evaporation. Fresh medium was added to each well and the plate was mixed. Non-contaminated membrane samples served as negative control. Bacterial growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 650 nm for 24 hours. ANOVA and Tukey's comparison tests were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The presence of the membrane samples did not disrupt bacterial growth. However, the presence of OsseoGuard membrane accelerated bacterial growth rate of S sanguinis and S epidermidis as compared to the other two membranes and control samples (P < .001), and of S aureus as compared to the control alone (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The tested collagen membranes have no antibacterial properties. However, OsseoGuard presents a significant bacterial growth enhancement effect with possible significant clinical implications on the success of regenerative procedures around teeth and implants.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - The bacterial adhesion on and the cytotoxicity of various dental cements used for implant-supported fixed restorations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial adhesion on and cytotoxicity of eight luting agents used for implant-supported restorations were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Surface roughness (Ra), surface free energy (SFE) values and three-dimensional images by atomic-force microscopy of circular specimens were determined. Bacterial suspensions of Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus epidermidis were incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 h. Adhering bacteria were examined with fluorescence dye CytoX-Violet, stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and visualized by fluorescence-microscopy. Cytotoxicity-testing was done with WST-1-tests (water soluble tetrazolium). No significant differences, neither with regard to Ra nor regarding SFE were determined. RESULTS: Adherence of S. sanguinis was less on titanium, TempBondNE and TempBond. TempBond, TempBondNE, RelyX Unicem and Implantlink Semi Classic presented low amounts of S. epidermidis. WST-testing showed high cytotoxic potential of Harvard, Aqualox, TempBondNE and TempBond. No combination of low adherent bacteria with low cytotoxicity was found. CONCLUSION: From a biological in-vitro perspective, none of the cements may be recommended for implant-supported restorations.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Streptococcus sanguinis isolate displaying a phenotype with cross-resistance to several rRNA-targeting agents.
AB  - This study describes a clinical case of a 71-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and a rare linezolid-resistant Streptococcus sanguinis strain (MIC, 32 mug/ml). The patient received courses of several antimicrobial agents, including linezolid for 79 days. The S. sanguinis strain had mutations in the 23S rRNA (T2211C, T2406C, G2576T, C2610T) and an amino acid substitution (N56D) in L22 and exhibited cross-resistance to ribosome-targeting agents.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - The effect of various topical peri-implantitis antiseptics on Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although peri-implantitis has presented an ever increasing problem in  modern dentistry, satisfying therapeutic strategies or scientifically based treatment recommendations are still not available. The main object of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of six different topical antiseptics on three test microorganisms attached to titanium implant specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For biofilm formation, plane titan specimens were incubated either in Candida albicans, Streptococcus sanguinis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis for 2h. The specimens were then treated with different topical antiseptics for 60s (sodium hypochlorite 1.0%, hydrogen peroxide 3.0%, chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2%, citric acid 40.0%, Plax, or Listerine) and with sterile saline as control. Remaining vital fungi were quantified by means of a bioluminometric assay and the bacterial load and the viability of adhering S. epidermidis and S. sanguinis by live or dead cell labelling in combination with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Sodium hypochlorite was effective against all three species, whereas hydrogen peroxide was solely effective against C. albicans. CHX and Listerine showed antimicrobial activity against S. sanguinis and C. albicans and citric acid and Plax against both tested bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: None of the tested antimicrobial agents, except for sodium hypochlorite, showed a significant in vitro effect on all three test microbes. Considering the possible toxicity of sodium hypochlorite, none of the tested - and so far widely used - antiseptics showed any broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect and could therefore not be recommended for the topical disinfection and detoxification of infected implant surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Fibrin- and collagen-based matrices attenuate inflammatory and procoagulant responses in human endothelial cell cultures exposed to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Infective endocarditis (IE) remains a serious complication after heart valve replacement. Autologous valves constructed by matrix-based tissue engineering are under investigation to increase biocompatibility. The impact of the underlying matrix on the risk to develop IE is not known. The IE is characterized by bacterial adhesion and subsequent interactions of disseminating bacteria with endothelial cells (ECs) and monocytes, evoking endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant activity, leading to heart valve destruction. In the current study, we, therefore, have seeded human ECs on a fibrin versus collagen gel matrix and, at confluence, infected them with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Especially Sta. aureus infected ECs grown on fibrin (4.2% of the inoculum) and collagen (3.7%) matrices, more than on ECs grown on noncoated plates (1.2%; p<0.01). This was associated with higher monocyte adhesion (61%; p<0.01 on fibrin and 43%; p<0.05 on collagen) versus control cultures (30%), even at comparable EC surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. The collagen matrix attenuated the Sta. aureus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression 2.0-fold, compared with the noncoated control ECs. This reduction coincided with a 4.2-5.0-fold reduction of the procoagulant activity, triggered in ECs grown on noncoated wells, as a consequence of tissue factor (TF) expression by ECs, further stimulated by EC-bound monocytes. Overall, moderate responses were seen on infection with Str. sanguis and Sta. epidermidis for both gel matrices. Thus, even when fibrin and collagen gel matrices equally increase bacterial adhesion, and subsequent monocyte adhesion to infected ECs, these matrices modulate EC responses to these stimuli, thus resulting in attenuated cytokine production and attenuated adherent monocyte-dependent TF production by the ECs. Further investigations will need to confirm whether also in vivo, EC-matrix interactions can attenuate EC responses to bacteria and inflammatory cells to reduce IE at infected endovascular sites.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - Stimulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. Eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. METHODS: Microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. Growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by P. gingivalis. It was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with P. gingivalis. Enhancement of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxS. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by F. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.
TI  - Review. Leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in inflammation focusing on inflammatory heart disease.
AB  - In multicellular organisms the development of adhesion bonds, either among cells  or among cells and components of the extracellular matrix, is a crucial process. These interactions are mediated by molecules which are named adhesion molecules and play a main role both at the early stages of the development of tissue integrity and later. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have a key role in several pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. Selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily of adhesion receptors mediate different steps of leukocyte migration from the bloodstream towards the inflammatory foci. Leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium are highly orchestrated processes that include the capture of free-flowing leukocytes from the blood with subsequent leukocyte rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and ensuing diapedesis. These interactions occur under high shear stresses within venules and depend on multiple families of adhesion molecules. As a response to infection mediators, leukocyte gathering is considered to be crucial for the adequate defence of the organism to any kind of injury or infection. Endothelial activation contributes significantly to the systemic inflammatory response to bacteraemia and increased expression. Release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of CAMs and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. It has been proposed that infection of endothelial cells with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis induces surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and monocyte adhesion. In general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion can no longer be viewed as occurring in discrete steps mediated by individual families of adhesion molecules but rather as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. These cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses.
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (Vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the Infectious Diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. Among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. Antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: Eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. The median age of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. Solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. Six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including 2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group G streptococci (n = 2 patients), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). All isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. Rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). None of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to Vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.
TI  - Repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  - Repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. We used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. The agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10 [77%] of 13 cases).
TI  - Increased killing of staphylococci and streptococci by daptomycin compared with cefazolin and vancomycin in an in vitro peritoneal dialysate model.
AB  - Peritoneal dialysate fluid (PDF) is a bacteriostatic medium that compromises the  antibacterial activity of cell wall-active agents. By use of an in vitro static model, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), and Streptococcus sanguis were exposed to daptomycin at concentrations of 10, 30, and 100 mg/liter, cefazolin at 125 mg/liter, and vancomycin at 25 mg/liter in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth or Todd Hewitt Broth (for S. sanguis) and PDF at pHs of 5.5 and 7.4. The pH had no effect on antibacterial activity. Neither cefazolin nor vancomycin produced a bactericidal or a bacteriostatic effect versus MRSA, MSSA, MSSE, or S. sanguis in PDF, while all concentrations of daptomycin were bactericidal against all organisms in PDF. Daptomycin did not exhibit concentration-dependent activity in PDF. Daptomycin appears to be a promising agent for use in peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, producing bacterial kill to a greater extent and at a higher rate than cefazolin or vancomycin in PDF.
TI  - Echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of Valsalva in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. We sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. METHODS: We reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from May 1994 to January 2002. The patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. RESULTS: Of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. Of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. The remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. There were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. We identified rupture of a sinus of Valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two, and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. The mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of Valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a Blalock-Taussig shunt in one patient each. Organisms isolated included Streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, Streptococcus sanguis in 1, Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and Enteroccocus in 2. Cultures proved negative in 7 patients. Surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). Only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. Both patients infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of Valsalva. CONCLUSION: Involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of Valsalva, in which case infection with Streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.
TI  - [The disinfection efficiency comparison of different treatments on dental impression and gypsum casts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, the disinfecting efficiency of five disinfecting methods to three bacterial: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis and Bacillus subtilis were evaluated. METHODS: Germ free impressions and gypsum casts were divided into three teams contained 16 impressions and 5 gypsum casts for each one. Each team was smeared with each one of the three bacterial solutions. Then four disinfecting methods were administrated on these impressions separately, 2% glutaraldehyde immersion, 2% glutaraldehyde spray, 5% Eric immersion, 5% Eric spray. And ozone treatment was administrated on gypsum casts. Control teams were set up. After the treatment the impressions and gypsum casts were sampled at standard sites. The colonies were counted after culture and were used to deduce the germicidal ratio as the standard of disinfecting efficiency. RESULTS: There was no difference between the efficiencies of five disinfecting methods for Streptococcus sanguis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. But for B. subtilis, the immersion methods have the highest efficiency among the methods and the ozone treatment has the least efficiency. CONCLUSION: 2% glutaraldehyde immersion, spray, 5% Eric immersion, spray are all effective disinfecting methods for impressions and ozone treatment is an effective method in disinfecting the gypsum casts.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Monocytes maintain tissue factor activity after cytolysis of bacteria-infected endothelial cells in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Intravascular infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Streptococcus sanguis can initiate fibrin formation on endocardial tissue, causing bacterial endocarditis. The ability of these bacteria to injure intact endothelial cells (ECs) and to aggravate tissue factor (TF)-dependent coagulation in the presence of blood leukocytes was investigated. Cytolysis of ECs occurred after infection with S. aureus and, with membrane-bound monocytes or granulocytes present, also after infection with S. sanguis or S. epidermidis. Monocytes that subsequently bound to the resultant bacteria-infected subcellular EC matrix (ECM) elicited TF mRNA, TF antigen, and TF activity (TFA). This was most pronounced in ECM prepared after the cytolysis of ECs by infection with S. aureus or S. epidermidis. We demonstrate that monocytes continue and intensify fibrin formation after lysis of bacteria-infected ECs, which suggests that, during the course of intravascular infection, early fibrin formation shifts from being mediated by EC-derived TFA to being mediated by TFA of monocytes bound to bacteria-infected ECM.
TI  - Monocytes augment bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor activity in bacterium-infected human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  - In bacterial endocarditis (BE), intravascular infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis can lead to formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart and cause heart dysfunction. The events that start the coagulation in the early stage of the disease are largely unknown. We have recently shown that human endothelial cells (EC) upon binding and internalization of S. aureus, but not S. sanguis or S. epidermidis, express tissue factor (TF)-dependent procoagulant activity (TFA). The present study shows that infection of EC with these three pathogens induces surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte adhesion. Subsequent coculture of these cells synergistically enhanced TFA, which was exclusively dependent on TF molecules that were expressed on EC during coculture. TFA induction required direct contact between monocytes and bacterium-infected EC, but the signals for this response were not generated by the binding of monocytes through their beta(2)- or alpha(4)-integrins to ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, respectively, on infected EC. The mechanism by which monocytes induce TFA in bacterium-infected EC was partly mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 produced by the cells during coculture. Endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha was not involved. This modulating effect of monocytes on species- and strain-dependent TFA of bacterium-infected EC supports our hypothesis that in an early stage in the pathogenesis of BE, as well as other intravascular infections that lead to detrimental fibrin formation, the coagulation cascade can be activated on the surfaces of EC as a consequence of specific interactions between pathogenic bacteria, EC, and monocytes.
TI  - Role of monocytes in experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
AB  - In the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis (BE), the clotting system plays a cardinal role in the formation and maintenance of the endocardial vegetations. The extrinsic pathway is involved in the activation of the coagulation pathway with tissue factor (TF) as the key protein. Staphylococcus aureus is a frequently isolated bacterium from patients with BE. We therefore investigated whether S. aureus can induce TF activity (TFA) on fibrin-adherent monocytes, used as an in vitro model of BE. We also assessed in vivo in rabbits with catheter induced vegetations, the effect of S. aureus infection on vegetational TFA. In vitro experiments showed that adherent S. aureus induced TFA on fibrin-adherent monocytes which was optimal at a bacterium/monocyte ratio of 1 to 1. Monocyte damage occurred when this ratio exceeded 4 to 1 (visually) or 6 to 1 (propidium iodide influx) Consequently, TFA decreased. In vivo S. aureus led to very high bacterial numbers in the vegetations and a significant increase of their weight. However, TFA of infected vegetations was the same as of sterile ones. This may be due to the high bacteria to monocyte ratio as well as bacterium-induced monocyte damage. Teicoplanin treatment of infected rabbits reduced bacterial numbers in the blood and in the vegetations. Two-day treatment resulted in an increase of vegetational TFA, but after four-day treatment vegetational TFA dropped, most probably due to a suboptimal bacterium/monocyte ratio. S. aureus endocarditis in etoposide (Vepesid)-treated rabbits, leading to a selective monocytopenia, caused a rapid death of the animals. In these rabbits no vegetations were found at all. We conclude that, like Streptococcus sanguis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus is able to induce TFA in fibrin-adherent blood monocytes. In addition, monocytes have a protective effect during the course of S. aureus endocarditis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor in human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  - A cardinal process in bacterial endocarditis (BE) is the activation of the clotting system and the formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart, the so-called endocardial vegetation. The processes that lead to the activation of the clotting system on endothelial surfaces upon exposure to bacteria are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated in an in vitro model whether infection of human endothelial cells (EC) with bacteria that are relevant to BE, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, leads to induction of tissue factor (TF)-dependent procoagulant activity (TFA) and whether this process is influenced by host factors, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), that are produced in response to the bacteremia in vivo. The results show that S. aureus binds to and is internalized by EC, resulting in expression of TF mRNA and TF surface protein as well as generation of TFA within 4 to 8 h after infection. No TFA was found when EC were exposed to UV-irradiated S. aureus or bacterial cell wall fragments. S. sanguis and S. epidermidis, although also binding to EC, did not induce endothelial TFA. This indicates a species and strain dependency. EC also expressed TFA after exposure to IL-1. The enhanced TFA of EC after exposure to S. aureus was not prevented by IL-1 receptor antagonist, arguing against an auto- or paracrine contribution of endogenous IL-1. When IL-1 was applied together with bacteria, this had a synergistic effect on the induction of EC TFA. This was found in particular with S. aureus but also, although to a lesser degree, with S. sanguis and S. epidermidis. This influence of IL-1 on the species- and strain-dependent induction of EC TFA suggests that bacterial factors as well as host factors orchestrate the induction of coagulation in an early stage in the pathogenesis of endovascular disease, such as BE.
TI  - beta-Hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. Samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% CO2 in air. A total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. Eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. All were identified as belonging to the Streptococcus sanguis group. No beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in apical periodontitis samples. Twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. Isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actionomyces odontolyticus and Peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces meyeri. Of 19 staphylococci and micrococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. However, less commonly known organisms such as Staphylococcus cohnii and Micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. The isolation of Bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.
TI  - Cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  - The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
TI  - Removal of infected pacemaker leads with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and  open surgical exploration of the superior vena cava and innominate veins.
AB  - Despite the use of transvenous methods for extraction of infected leads, failed attempts may result in retained lead fragments. Retained lead fragments may be a focus of continued infection leading to sepsis. We present two patients in which conversion from cardiopulmonary bypass to hypothermic circulatory arrest allowed direct visualization, using venotomies in the superior vena cava and innominate vein to achieve complete removal of retained pacemaker lead fragments. Use of venotomies in the extracardiac venous system is a technical addition to prior descriptions of lead extraction using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.
TI  - Increased levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor in patients on CAPD: a study during non-infected steady state and peritonitis.
AB  - Long-term influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the peritoneal effluent, and the effect of peritonitis on these cytokines were investigated. TGF-beta1 and bFGF were assayed in effluent samples from dialysate bags collected during the initial week of treatment with CAPD and at 5 months. To determine the effect of peritonitis, dialysate bags were collected on admission to the hospital and on days 3 and 10 and also during non-infected steady state. Serum was drawn prior to infection and on days 1 and 10. TGF-beta1 increased more than threefold during the longitudinal follow-up period, median concentrations of 35 pg/ml to 106 pg/ml (P<0.05). No change in bFGF was seen during this initial 5 months. TGF-beta1 was increased on the first day of peritonitis (median concentration 169 pg/ml) and reached its maximum on day 3 of infection, (median concentration 216 pg/ml) (P<0.05 vs non-infected state, median concentration 39 pg/ml). Basic FGF reached a maximum on day three of infection (median concentration 7.7 pg/ml; P=0.01 vs non-infected state) and then slowly declined. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 is influenced by CAPD treatment per se, and together with bFGF is increased during peritonitis, indicating its importance in the peritoneum and its potential involvement in the development of tissue fibrosis and eventually ultrafiltration failure.
TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis. Report of 7 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We report on 7 patients with pacemaker endocarditis diagnosed during the workup of long-standing fever. Persistent positive blood cultures and echocardiography led to the diagnosis in 6 patients whereas autopsy was diagnostic in another. Causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Streptococcus bovis (1), and Streptococcus mitis-Streptococcus sanguis (1). Pulmonary embolism was present in nearly 50% of the cases, a figure clearly higher than previously reported. In all but 1 case the initial medical approach was not successful, and thus the pacing system was finally removed. None of the cases relapsed after the removal. We have reviewed the literature regarding pacemaker endocarditis, particularly with respect to treatment.
TI  - Purification and properties of a bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. Its molecular mass was 3500 Da and pI was 10.5. This bacteriocin inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis, but Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. The mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
TI  - Detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16S rRNA gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. The use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. One hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), Streptococcus mitis (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). Eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected bacterial DNA in nine of 11 blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for PCR; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the conventional identification of the cultured isolates. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures, 18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. The species presumptively identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing were as follows: Pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), Acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); Escherichia spp. (n = 3); Moraxella spp. (n = 3); Staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); Neisseria spp. (n = 1); and Bacillus spp. (n = 1). The results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.
TI  - Role of monocytes and bacteria in Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis.
AB  - The endocardial vegetation which is formed in the course of bacterial endocarditis (BE) contains tissue factor (TF)-dependent procoagulant activity. Earlier studies showed that monocytes are the main source of TF in the vegetations. The TF activity (TFA) of vegetations isolated from Streptococcus sanguis-infected rabbits depended on the numbers of bacteria as well as monocytes in the vegetation. In this study, we investigated whether for Staphylococcus epidermidis, a frequent pathogen in BE, an effect similar to that found for S. sanguis could be shown. In vitro, S. epidermidis was found to stimulate TFA of fibrin adherent monocytes significantly. This stimulation was maximal at a bacterium-to-monocyte ratio of 7. In vivo, TFA was found to be significantly higher in S. epidermidis-infected than in sterile catheter-induced vegetations. Reduction of vegetational bacterial numbers by teicoplanin treatment lead to a small but significant decrease of TFA. Reduction of monocyte numbers by etoposide did not affect vegetational TFA. Comparison of data for S. epidermidis and S. sanguis revealed that at equivalent bacterial numbers, vegetational TFAs were approximately the same for both microorganisms. Combining the results of the present study with those of a previous study using S. sanguis, we conclude that the main factor determining monocyte-dependent vegetational TFA is the number of vegetation-associated bacteria. The lower TFA found for S. epidermidis-infected than for S. sanguis-infected vegetations can be explained by the significantly lower bacterial numbers in the infected vegetations and consequently a lower stimulation of vegetation-associated monocytes.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151 consecutive CSF bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. Treatment decisions associated with individual CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. Treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial therapy based on the reporting of CSF culture isolates. Thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. Three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from 34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (Candida tropicalis, Proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second CSF specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. Thus, only a single isolate (3%; Staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. In contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; Cryptococcus neoformans, 10; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; Streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). We conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from CSF specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of CSF broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.
TI  - The interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  - Liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (SA), dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (DCchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. Targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems DPPC-chol-SA, DPPC-DPPG and DPPC-PI liposomes to S. epidermidis. The effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for S. epidermidis biofilms. It was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. The delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide Triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. Superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for DPPC-chol-SA liposomes and for Triclosan delivery by DPPC-DPPG and DPPC-PI liposomes targeted to S. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. DPPC-chol-SA liposomes were also effective for delivery of Triclosan to S. sanguis biofilms. Double labelling experiments using [14C]-chlorhexidine and [3H]-DPPC suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.
TI  - Treatment of endocarditis with teicoplanin: a retrospective analysis of 104 cases.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease but retains a high mortality. Glycopeptides are used for patients with resistant pathogens, those allergic to penicillins or for those outside the hospital. The once daily administration of teicoplanin and its low toxicity suggest that it would be suitable for use in the long courses required for endocarditis. However, the dosage and combinations to be used require further study. A retrospective review has been made of 104 episodes of endocarditis treated with teicoplanin in 101 patients seen over 7 years. Most patients had been referred to major London hospitals following failure of medical treatment. After three loading doses of 400 mg, teicoplanin was given at a dose of 400 mg/day in combination with other antibiotics such as gentamicin. Follow up was for one year. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus sanguis (15 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (13 cases) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10 cases). Of 80 patients febrile at the start of treatment with teicoplanin, 63 (79%) lost their fever within a median of 2 days (1-35 days). Cure without surgery was effected in 50 (48%) and 75% of patients survived. Other antibiotics, usually gentamicin or rifampicin, were used in 92 (90%) of patients. Two strains of Streptococcus spp. were said to be resistant but there was no relationship between MIC of teicoplanin and outcome. Pathogens with a high MBC tended to be more likely to resist treatment. Adverse effects resulted in the withdrawal of teicoplanin in 20 cases (19%) but most events were mild and renal deterioration occurred in only five patients. Teicoplanin was effective in the treatment of endocarditis and appeared to be safe given the severity of disease in the patients treated.
TI  - Bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. The absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. To identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. Peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mM) for 4 h and with the pH kept at 7.0 by a pH-stat. Removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or 294.4 mM [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. Hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, Streptococcus sanguis I and II (sanguis and oralis), and Strep. mitior (mitis biotype I); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mM were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mM when grown anaerobically. Earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. The amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. None of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, Neisseria sicca, Haemophilus segnis, H. parainfluenzae, Actinomyces viscosus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. The ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mM. This almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mM. In the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The targeting of phospholipid liposomes to bacteria.
AB  - Phospholipid liposomes have been prepared from phospholipid mixtures including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (DPPC/PI) and DPPC/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPC/DPPG) mixtures and targeted to adsorbed biofilms of the skin-associated bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus vulgaris and the oral bacterium Streptococcus sanguis. The effects of time, liposome concentration and density of bacteria in the biofilm have been studied in detail for Staphylococcus epidermidis. The targeting (as assessed by the apparent monolayer coverage of the biofilms by liposomes) to the biofilms was found to be sensitive to the mol% of PI and DPPG in the liposomes and optimum levels of PI were found for targeting to each bacterium. The use of PI and DPPG-containing liposomes for the delivery of the bactericide, Triclosan, to biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis was studied as a function of the amount of Triclosan carried by the liposomes. All the liposome systems tested inhibited the growth of bacteria from the biofilms after brief (2 min) exposure to Triclosan-carrying liposomes. At low Triclosan levels bacterial growth inhibition by Triclosan-carrying liposomes exceeded that by an equivalent level of free Triclosan. After short periods (min) of exposure of biofilms to Triclosan-carrying liposomes the bactericide was shown to preferentially concentrate in the biofilms relative to its liposomal lipid carrier. The results suggest that phospholipid liposomes with appropriately chosen lipid composition have potential for the targeting and delivery of bactericide to bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  - Microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  - The microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of Goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. Non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. Streptococci, predominantly S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). Beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. Haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. H. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and H. influenzae being identified in only one sample. Anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. Staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, S. epidermidis dominating. Fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. Thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cytotoxic drugs may influence isolation of bacteria and fungi from blood cultures.
AB  - The potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against Gram positive and negative bacteria and Candida albicans was examined. The time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. Doxorubicin retarded the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. An inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.
TI  - Bacteria reactive to plaque-toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are related  to the severity of gingivitis at the sampled site.
AB  - Certain monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) neutralize the inhibition of HL60 cell growth by bacterial plaque extracts. The aim of this study was to enumerate and identify the bacteria reactive to these Mabs at sites where periodontal disease was measured by gingival index, pocket depth and attachment loss. The bacterial colonies were grown on blood agar and the colonies counted directly and after immunoblotting. Sites that bled on probing (n = 15) had a mean of 3.35% Mab-positive colonies (SEM = 0.52%) and sites that did not bleed (n = 9) had a mean of 1.61% (SEM = 0.41%). The percentage of Mab-positive colonies also correlated with gingival index but not with the total number of colonies sampled, attachment loss or pocket depth. Antigen was expressed by 4 genera: strains of Streptococcus sanguis and/or Eikenella corrodens (8 sites), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4 sites) and Corynebacterium minutissimus (1 site). The results suggest that the antigens detected on these bacteria by the Mabs may be processed to form toxins and maintain gingivitis by irritating the surrounding cells.
TI  - [Etiology of bacterial endocarditis in materials from Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Clinics of the Lodz Academy].
AB  - In the years 1986-1991, 72 cases of bacterial endocarditis (BE) were investigated. The bacteria were isolated from blood in 24 cases, from native and artificial valves obtained during surgery in 24 cases, and from both blood and valves in 6 cases. Following microorganisms were isolated: S. epidermidis, S. xylosus, S. hominis, S. aureus, Micrococcus sp., S. mitis, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, M. lacunata, E. adecarboxylata, P. maltophila, Corynebacterium sp., A. calcoaceticus var. lwoffii, and Aspergillus sp. Gram-positive bacteria were prevailing among isolated strains. Staphylococci were present in 55.7% (29 cases) and among them coagulase-negative staphylococci occurred in 89.7% (26 cases). Streptococci were isolated from 9 patients (17.3%) and Gram-negative rods from 5 patients (9.65%). Coryneform bacteria were detected in 7 cases (13.5%). There was no relation between type of removed valve and colonizing it bacteria. From native and artificial valves coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated, respectively, in 48.3% and 52.2%. Susceptibility of isolated bacteria to 27 antibiotics was determined. Multiple resistant strains were present most frequently among staphylococci.
TI  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to exocellular  proteins of Staphylococcus aureus in bone infection.
AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for measurement of the antibody response to exocellular protein antigens of Staphylococcus aureus. The wells of a microtitre plate were coated with the exocellular proteins present in the tryptic soya broth growth medium from a stationary phase culture of a bone infection strain of S. aureus. The wells were then reacted sequentially with patient sera, protein A-peroxidase conjugate and chromogenic substrate. Serum from patients with S. aureus bone infection gave a significantly higher IgG titre than sera from patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Streptococcus sanguis bone infection or healthy uninfected individuals. The assay therefore appears to have potential in the serodiagnosis of S. aureus bone infection.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by oral streptococci against human carrier strains of staphylococci.
AB  - All strains of oral streptococci tested and specially those of Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sanguis and Strep. mitior produced more than one distinct bacteriocin-like substance with variable inhibitory activity on 20 indicator staphylococci. Inhibitory activity was comparatively higher on nasal strains of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis than on strains of both species isolated from the mouth. Nineteen of 20 staphylococcal indicators were inhibited by 1-12 of the 12 effector streptococci. Sensitivity of nasal staphylococci to bacteriocins (frequency of positive inhibitory tests and total inhibition zone diameters) was significantly higher (P less than 0.001, chi 2 test and P less than 0.05, t test respectively) than that of oral ones. The sensitivity of nasal over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) and of oral Staph. epidermidis over oral Staph. aureus (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05) was also significantly higher. The evaluation of variability of inhibitory patterns of bacteriocins produced by streptococci (p-typing), of sensitivity patterns of staphylococci to bacteriocins (s-typing) and of the significantly higher sensitivity of nasal over oral staphylococci to bacteriocins from the epidemiological and ecological viewpoints are discussed.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Antistaphylococcal activity of pentamidine.
AB  - Pentamidine isethionate was bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Candida albicans. S. aureus was inhibited by concentrations of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml and killed by 64 to greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcal killing was consistently greater in the presence of cations and was unaffected by methicillin resistance.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - Daptomycin (LY146032) for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of daptomycin (LY146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. A single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of S. aureus and S. sanguis. Daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of S. epidermidis. A single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. For treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. Daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single daily dose of 600,000 U of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of S. sanguis.
TI  - In vitro adherence of bacteria to sutures in cardiac surgery.
AB  - The adherence of bacteria to sutures used in cardiac surgery was studied by in vitro quantitative determination with [3H]-leucine-labeled Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguis. The adherence per unit area for staphylococci was least for monofilament polypropylene (Prolene), 3 times higher (p less than 0.05) for braided polyester (Mersiline) and greatest (10 times, p less than 0.005) for braided polyester sutures coated with polybutylate (Ethibond). Mean values for the adherence of streptococci were low for all the sutures. Sutures pretreated with human plasma showed a 12-37% increase in bacterial adherence. The cell surface hydrophobicity, surface charge and the haemagglutinating property of bacteria did not correlate with their adherence property. In view of these observations, it is suggested that: (a) the preferential adherence of staphylococci to intra-cardiac sutures may be one of the explanations for its being the commonest cause of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, (b) there is a need for a careful selection of sutures used in cardiac surgery and (c) the described in vitro assay for bacterial adherence may be used for monitoring the development of better designed sutures and the effect of incorporation of antibiotics in the sutures.
TI  - [A clinical evaluation of sultamicillin fine granules in the treatment of meibomianitis].
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. A dose of 375 mg SBTPC granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. The results obtained are summarized as follows. Efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. No side effects were observed throughout the study. The organisms isolated were Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Streptococcus sanguis, and Gram-negative bacteria such as Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. xylosoxidans, Xanthomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter lwoffii. A bacteriological study showed lower MICs of SBTPC than those of ampicillin (ABPC), suggesting that SBTPC has more potent antibacterial activity than ABPC. Such bacteriological activity of SBTPC was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to ABPC or cefaclor.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. In this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of NBTE (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. The adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. Microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, S. sanguis) bound significantly better (P less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (Escherichia coli, C. krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. Microbial adhesion to fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., ID50) with preexistent NBTE. A similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. The results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of NBTE, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - A-16686, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes. II. Biological properties.
AB  - A-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic obtained from fermentation of an Actinoplanes strain, is active against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; MIC values ranged from 0.016 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. A-16686 is bactericidal for growing cells of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. mutans, S. mitis and S. sanguis. There is no cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics. A-16686, administered subcutaneously, is very effective in experimental S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae septicemias in the mouse.
TI  - Characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for lipoteichoic acid from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A hybrid cell line, 3G6, producing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the polyglycerophosphate (PGP) backbone of lipoteichoic acids has been derived by the polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified glucosyltransferase from culture supernatant of Streptococcus mutans strain 6715. Immunodiffusion tests and ELISA revealed that the antibody reacted with purified PGP from group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain Sv as well as crude phenol-water and saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria except for a few species such as biotype B S. sanguis, Micrococcus sp., and Actinomyces viscosus. Whole cells of serotype b S. mutans and Staphylococcus epidermidis were agglutinated upon addition of 3G6 mAb, while those of most other species were not significantly affected by this procedure. A hapten inhibition study showed that glycerophosphate was only a potent inhibitor of passive hemagglutination reactions between LTA coated sheep erythrocytes and 3G6 mAb.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. Sampling was by syringe aspiration. Strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. Randomly selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. Seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. One abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, Streptococcus milleri. Streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. The common oral streptococcus, Streptococcus sanguis, constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, other Bacteroides including B. oralis and B. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Enhancement of generation of monocyte tissue thromboplastin by bacterial phagocytosis: possible pathway for fibrin formation on infected vegetations in bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - The deposition of fibrin on infected vegetations and the presence of mononuclear  phagocytes that have phagocytized bacteria are remarkabe features in experimental bacterial endocarditis. In a study in vitro, we show that phagocytosis of bacteria by human monocytes enhances thromboplastin generation by these cells. Maximal enhancement of the generation of thromboplastin by monocytes was about six times compared with that in the control experiment without bacteria, and it was obtained by preincubation of the monocytes with 5 to 10 bacteria per monocyte. No quantitative difference was observed between Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sanguis as to the enhancement of the monocyte thromboplastin generation. An enhancement of the procoagulant activity generation was also observed after addition of bacteria to human or rabbit whole blood. Probably, this generation was also due to synthesis of thromboplastin by monocytes. It is conceivable that fibrin deposition on infected vegetations during bacterial endocarditis is mediated by thromboplastin synthesis by monocytes.
TI  - Secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  - Inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis. Lipid secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. This novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: S. sanguis (group H), S. pyogenes (group A), And S. pneumoniae. The secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating with resumption of culture growth. All cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. It is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.
