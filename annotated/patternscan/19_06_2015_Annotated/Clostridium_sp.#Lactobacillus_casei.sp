TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == changes in gut microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis administered the bacteria lactobacillus casei dn--114001.
AB  == gut microbiota was analyzed in children, aged 6-18 months and suffering from atopic dermatitis before and after 3 month supplementation of their diet with lactobacillus casei dn--114001 in a dose of 109 cells daily. on completion of this period the total number of fecal lactobacillus sp. cells decreased from 7.86 log10 cfu/g to 6.40 log10 cfu/g. after the next 5 months (without dietary supplementation with the probiotic bacteria) the level of lactobacillus sp. cells was maintained at the latter value. during the dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain, the level of bifidobacterium cells was maintained at 6.15-6.89  log10 cfu/g while after 5 months it decreased to 5.57 log10 cfu/g. the population of clostridium sp. was reduced after 3 months of dietary supplementation from 6.49 to 5.83 log10 cfu/g and was maintained at the latter level during the next 5 months. the dietary supplementation had no effect on populations of bacteroides sp., enterococcus sp. and enterobacteriaceae. supplementation of children who developed atopic dermatitis with the preparation of lactobacillus casei dn - 114001 positively affected their gut microbiota in terms of bifidobacteria and clostridia populations.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == [influence of selected lactobacillus sp. on clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  == this study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of lactobacillus spp. (l. plantarum 2017405, l. rhamnosus gg, l. acidophilus dsm 21007 and l. fernmentumn 353) on clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. forty strains c. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (aad) were used. among c.  difficile strains 13 produced toxin a and b (a+b+cdt-), 14 produced only toxin b  (ab'cdt), 9 produced toxins a and b and possessing of binary toxin genes (a+b+cdt-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (a-b-cdt-). we did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of c. difficile strains.

TI  == lactic acid bacterial diversity in the traditional mexican fermented dough pozol  as determined by 16s rdna sequence analysis.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria diversity of pozol, a mexican fermented maize dough, was studied using a total dna extraction and purification procedure and pcr amplification of 16s rdna for gram-positive and related bacterial groups. thirty-six clones were obtained and sequenced to 650 nucleotides. these partial sequences were identified by submission to the non-redundant nucleotide database  of ncbi. the identified sequences were aligned with reference sequences of the closest related organisms. this analysis indicated that only 14 sequences were unique clones and these were identified as lactococcus lactis, streptococcus suis, lactobacillus plantarum, lact. casei, lact. alimentarium, and lact. delbruekii and clostridium sp. two non-ribosomal sequences were also detected. unlike other environments analyzed with this molecular approach where many unidentified microorganisms are found, the identity of most sequences could be established as lactic acid bacteria, indicating that this is the main group among the gram-positive bacteria in pozol. use of this molecular method permitted detection of lactic acid bacteria different from those previously isolated and identified by culture techniques

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.
