TI  == microbial hydrogen production from sweet potato starch residue.
AB  == clostridium butyricum could produce hydrogen from a sweet potato starch residue upon supplementation of nitrogen sources. a repeated batch culture using a mixed  culture of c. butyricum and enterobacter aerogenes produced hydrogen with a yield of 2.4 mol h2/mol glucose under a controlled culture ph of 5.25 in a medium consisting of the sweet potato starch residue and 0.1% polypepton without addition of any reducing agents. rhodobacter sp. m-19 produced hydrogen from the  supernatant of the culture broth obtained in the repeated batch culture containing c. butyricum and e. aerogenes when 50 microg/l na2moo4.2h2o and 20 mg/l edta were added to the supernatant and it was cultured under a controlled culture ph of 7.5. a high yield of hydrogen of 7.0 mol h2/mol glucose from the starch remaining in the starch residue was attained in two-step repeated batch cultures containing c. butyricum and e. aerogenes, and by rhodobacter sp. m-19.
