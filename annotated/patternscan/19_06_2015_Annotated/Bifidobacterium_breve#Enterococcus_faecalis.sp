TI  == rna of enterococcus faecalis strain ec-12 is a major component inducing interleukin-12 production from human monocytic cells.
AB  == interleukin-12 (il-12) is an important cytokine for the immunomodulatory effects  of lactic acid bacteria (lab). using murine immune cells, we previously reported  that the rna of enterococcus faecalis ec-12, a lab strain exerting probiotic-like beneficial effects, is the major il-12-inducing immunogenic component. however, it was recently revealed that bacterial rna can be a ligand for toll-like receptor (tlr) 13, which is only expressed in mice. because tlr13 is not expressed in humans, the immuno-stimulatory and -modulatory effects of lab rna in human cells should be augmented excluding tlr13 contribution. in experiment 1 of  this study, the role of lab rna in il-12 induction in human immune cells was studied using three lab strains, e.faecalis ec-12, lactobacillus gasseri jcm5344, and bifidobacterium breve jcm1192. rnase a treatment of heat-killed lab significantly decreased the il-12 production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells on stimulation, while rnase iii treatment revealed virtually no effects. further, il-12 production against heat-killed e. faecalis ec-12 was abolished by depleting monocytes. these results demonstrated that single stranded rna (ssrna) of lab is a strong inducer of il-12 production from human monocytes.  in experiment 2, major receptor for ssrna of e. faecalis ec-12 was identified using thp-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. the type of rna molecules of e. faecalis ec-12 responsible for il-12 induction was also identified. il-12 production induced by the total rna of e. faecalis ec-12 was significantly reduced by the treatment of sirna for tlr8 but not for tlr7. furthermore, both 23s and 16s rrna, but not mrna, of e. faecalis ec-12 markedly induced il-12 production from thp-1 cells. these results suggested that the recognition of ssrna of e. faecalis ec-12 was mediated by tlr8 and that rrna was the rna molecule that exhibited il-12-inducing ability in human cells.

TI  == bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  == purpose of review: in the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. recent findings: studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. there is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of  the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. however, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. there are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, escherichia coli plus enterococcus faecalis in prosymbioflor and heat-killed bifidobacterium  breve and streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not  be reduced by these interventions. summary: during the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. there was only an effect on eczema in the prosymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using b. breve and s. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. however, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.

TI  == effect of functional yogurt ny-yp901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  == background/objectives: this study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt ny-yp901 (namyang dairy product co. ltd and nutra r&bt inc., seoul, korea) supplemented with mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing bifidobacterium breve (cbg-c2), enterococcus faecalis fk-23, fibersol-2 and so on. subjects/methods: this study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt ny-yp901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. body weight and body mass  index (bmi), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with hba1c and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. results: during the period august 2009 to december 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. in the treatment group consuming ny-yp901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, p<0.05), bmi (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), p<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, p<0.05) after 8 weeks. the change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. conclusions: the functional yogurt ny-yp901 reduced ldl-cholesterol, body weight and bmi in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. from these findings, regular intake of functional  yogurt ny-yp901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.

TI  == anti-inflammatory effects of the genus bifidobacterium on macrophages by modification of phospho-i kappab and socs gene expression.
AB  == although beneficial roles of probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases have been reported, their direct action on immune cells has not been elucidated. in this study, we investigated how three species of bifidobacterium and enterococcus faecalis differentially modulate production of cytokines from lipopolysaccharide  (lps)-stimulated macrophages in vitro using raw264.7 cells. the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased after exposure to lps, e. faecalis alone and lps combined with e. faecalis. in contrast, il-10 mrna levels  were significantly decreased after exposure to e. faecalis compared with exposure to bifidobacterium species. when cells were exposed to bifidobacterium species combined with lps, mrna levels of il12p40 were decreased by co-culture with b. breve and b. longum, il-1 beta mrna levels were decreased by b. breve and b. adorescentis and tnf-alpha mrna levels were decreased by b. adolescentis compared with lps alone. the three species of bifidobacterium significantly inhibited phosphorylation of i kappab-alpha induced by lps. the mrna levels of socs1 and socs3 were increased by exposure to lps alone; however, the mrna levels of socs1  or socs3 were increased more by exposure to bifidobacterium species combined with lps. conversely, e. faecalis combined with lps induced significantly lower levels of socs mrna than those induced by bifidobacterium species combined with lps. these results indicated that certain species of genus bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced from lps-stimulated raw264.7 cells, which is possibly related to inhibition of i kappab-alpha phosphorylation and stimulation of socs signalling.

TI  == glucose but not polypeptone reduces the effect of probiotic preparations to stimulate carbohydrate breakdown and reduce net ammonia production by pig cecal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == probiotic preparations are used to prevent or treat diarrhea. probiotic preparations increase the in vitro breakdown of carbohydrates and decrease that of protein by mixed cecal bacteria in the absence of readily fermentable materials. diarrhea can increase the influx of readily digestible materials into  the large intestine. therefore, we compared production of organic acids and ammonia in batch cultures using pig cecal contents with or without probiotic preparations (clostridium butyricum, lactobacillus casei plus bifidobacterium breve, or l. casei plus enterococcus faecalis) and with or without readily fermentable substrates (glucose or polypeptone). effects of additional substrates appeared earlier than those of probiotic preparations. both probiotic preparations and glucose increased the production of most short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid but decreased those of ammonia and isovaleric acid. effects of probiotic preparations and glucose were not additive. effects of different preparations were alike. polypeptone increased the production of ammonia and isovaleric acid independent of probiotic preparations. effects of probiotics and  glucose may be to provide either energy or carbon to the microbial ecosystem. effects of glucose were probably mediated through their direct utilization by indigenous bacteria.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.

TI  == specific species of intestinal bacteria influence the induction of aberrant crypt foci by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.
AB  == to shed light on the association of intestinal microflora with the development of colon cancer, we studied the modifying effects of intestinal microflora on the occurrence of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (acf) in germfree (gf), gnotobiotic (gb) and conventionalized (cvd) rats. in the  first part of this study, 10 week old germfree fischer-344 rats were randomly assigned to three groups and two groups of rats were orally inoculated with mixtures of pure culture of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, and several strains of bacteroides and clostridium species (gb), or feces from conventional rats (cvd). inoculated rats were given two weekly i.p. injections of dmh (20 mg/kg body wt) at 13 and 14 weeks of age. rats were sacrificed 11 or 34 weeks after the last dmh injection for acf scoring. the total number of acf, acf with four or more crypts/focus, and mean number of aberrant crypts per focus (crypt multiplicity) in gb rats sacrificed at week 34 were 168% (p < 0.001), 442% (p < 0.001) and 138% (p < 0.001) of those in gf rats, respectively. on the other hand, the same values in cvd rats were 42% (p < 0.001), 147% (p = 0.246) and 159% (p <  0.001) of those in gf rats, respectively. similar results were observed in rats that were sacrificed at week 11. in the second part of this study, the effect of  colonization of bifidobacterium breve on the acf profiles was examined in gb rats. the number of acf with four or more crypts/focus and crypt multiplicity in  gb plus b. breve rats at week 11 were significantly lower than those of gb rats (p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively), although the former was not statistically significant at week 34. these findings suggest that some intestinal bacteria might behave as promoters and some as anti-promoters in colon carcinogenesis.

TI  == [effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == [influence of s-1108 on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the effect of s-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and pediatric patients. s-1108 in a fine granular form was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. the viable fecal bacterial cell count of each of these 4 species of bacteria was slightly reduced in 5 days after the start of  the drug administration. five boys (weighing 12.0 to 42.0 kg) with bacterial infections were entered into this pediatric study. their ages ranged from 2 years 4 months to 9 years 3 months. s-1108 (fine granules) was administered at a dose of 2.3 to 6.0 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 5 to 11 days. cell counts of primary aerobes, anaerobes and total anaerobic cells decreased markedly in three patients, but in the remaining two patients the total number of aerobic and anaerobic cells did not change appreciably. glucose-nonfermentating gram-negative rods did not become predominant during the period of s-1108 administration. candida became predominant in the three patients in whom the other bacteria had markedly decreased. counts of predominant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased markedly during the regimen in 3 out of 5 cases. s-1006 was detected in stools of the 3 cases at concentrations ranging from 235 to 516 micrograms/g during the administration of s-1108. intestinal bacteria that produce beta-lactamase were not present in the feces of any of the patients. based on these results, s-1108 (fine granules) appears to have relatively little effect on intestinal bacterial flora similarly to other new oral cephems. because of individual differences, however, the drug may be excreted in the feces at high concentrations, and this would result in changes in intestinal bacterial flora. therefore, attention must be given to fecal drug concentrations.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies were carried out on sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained  are summarized as follows: 1. a total of 248 clinical isolates were employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of sbt/abpc against various bacterial species. sbt/abpc showed stronger antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms than against gram-negative rods. 2. the peak serum level  of abpc was about twice as high as that of sbt, and serum levels of abpc and sbt  declined with time. both drugs showed almost the same trend of changes in concentrations. the half-lives of both drugs were about 1 hour. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 52-80% for abpc and 70-73%  for sbt. 4. the effect of sbt/abpc on coagulation system was examined. no case showed changes in pt, aptt, tt and hpt before and after administration of sbt/abpc. platelet aggregation during administration of sbt/abpc was slightly faster than that before administration, suggesting that sbt/abpc had no effect on platelet aggregation. generally speaking, it seemed that sbt/abpc was a safe antibiotic for bleeding. 5. the effect of sbt/abpc on the intestinal bacterial flora in experimental animals was examined. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve were reduced after administration of sbt/abpc, suggesting that the intestinal bacterial flora was affected by the administration of sbt/abpc more greatly than by the administration of abpc alone. in a similar investigation being made with clinical cases, both aerobes and anaerobes showed great changes. concentrations of the drugs in feces increased with increasing dosage, resulting in greater changes of  the intestinal bacterial flora. thus, the total number of aerobes and anaerobes was reduced. no diarrhea was observed in any subjects examined. from the above results, it appeared that sbt/abpc was a safe and useful antibiotic for various bacterial infections in the field of pediatrics.
