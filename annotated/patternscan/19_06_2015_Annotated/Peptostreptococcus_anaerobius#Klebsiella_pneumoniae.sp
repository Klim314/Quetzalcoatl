TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == the relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == during the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (lc/ms). of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, klebsiella pneumoniae, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.

TI  == [a clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  == ceftazidime (caz) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying  respiratory diseases. the clinical efficacy and side effects of caz were investigated. the mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and  48.0 kg, respectively. caz was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. in the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of peptococcus sp., fusobacterium necrophorum and serratia marcescens. side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated got, gpt and al-p values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after caz treatment was discontinued.

TI  == [clinical studies on cefuzonam in obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  == to evaluate the usefulness and the safety of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) against obstetric and gynecological infections, we conducted clinical trials and obtained the results summarized as follows. 1. thirteen patients with obstetric and gynecological infections (intrauterine infection 2 cases, adnexitis 7, 1 case each of abscess of adnexa uteri, abscess of the vaginal wall, pyelonephritis, and mammitis) were treated with czon. the czon was administered by intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion, 1 g twice daily for 4 to 7 days (8 g to 14 g in total). the clinical effect was good in 12 and poor in 1. 2. four cases,  on which other antimicrobial agents were ineffective, responded well to czon. 3.  the czon displayed excellent effects on anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis) and gram negative rods (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae). 4. no side effects or laboratory abnormalities were observed. 5. from the above results, czon appeared to be an effective and useful  drug for obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
