TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and eperezolid, two novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid (formerly u-100766) and eperezolid (formerly u-100592) are novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents that are active against multi-drug-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, corynebacteria, and mycobacteria. preliminary studies also demonstrated that the compounds inhibited some test strains of anaerobic bacteria. therefore, we extended the in vitro evaluation of  these agents to include a total of 54 different anaerobic species. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined using a standard agar dilution method for 143 anaerobic bacterial isolates. eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated potent activity against the anaerobic gram-positive organisms with most mic values in the range of 0.25-4 microg/ml. viridans streptococci demonstrated mics of 1-2 microg/ml; peptostreptococcus species and propionibacterium species were inhibited by </=0.25-1 microg/ml. clostridial species were generally susceptible to the oxazolidinones (mics of </=0.25-8 microg/ml); however, seven strains of clostridium difficile with linezolid mics of 16 microg/ml or greater were detected. against the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, linezolid was more potent than eperezolid, especially for bacteroides  species. linezolid inhibited most bacteroides in the range of 2-8 microg/ml, while eperezolid was generally two- to eight-fold less active. linezolid and eperezolid both demonstrated potent activity against fusobacterium species,mobiluncus species,prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas asaccharolytica (mics of </=0.25-0.5 microg/ml). overall, the oxazolidinones demonstrated a significant level of activity against a number of clinically-important anaerobic bacterial species. linezolid may potentially provide a broader spectrum of anaerobic coverage than eperezolid due to its greater activity against bacteroides species.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with nasal polyposis.
AB  == aspirates from 48 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses from patients who had nasal polyposis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was present in 46 (96%) specimens. aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in 6 (13%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria alone in 18 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 22 (48%). there were 110 bacterial isolates (2.4 per specimen). thirty-nine of the isolates were aerobic or facultative organisms (0.85 per specimen). the predominant aerobic or facultative organisms were: staphylococcus aureus, microaerophilic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. seventy-one anaerobes were isolated (1.5 per specimen), peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas asaccharolytica and fusobacterium spp. being predominant. these findings illustrate for the first time the presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis who had nasal polyposis.

TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == a study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), bacteroides vulgatus  (5 strains), bacteroides spp. (15 strains), prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), peptococcus niger (3 strains), peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), peptococcus spp (30 strains), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in wilkins-chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in  an atmosphere of 10% h2, 10% co2, 80% n2. all the drugs tested exert their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic isolates. in particular, trospectomycin is quite active against gram-positive cocci (mic 90 =  4 - 8 mg/l), gram-negative rods (mic 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), gram-positive rods (mic 90 = 4 mg/l) and mobiluncus spp. (mic 90 = 0.5 mg/l).

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  == the vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. bv, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and  characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (p < 0.01). the condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. bv was associated with low birth weight. of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with bv were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (p < 0.0005). the presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and bv. bv-associated microorganisms, i.e., mobiluncus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, fusobacterium nucleatum, mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with bv (p = 0.0001 for each comparison). mobiluncus curtisii and fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. our study clearly indicates that bv and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.

TI  == [cytotoxicity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected root canal].
AB  == bacteria in the infected root canal play an important role in the progression of  the periapical lesion. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of bacteria isolated from an infected root canal on the periapical lesion. four obligately anaerobic bacteria were isolated and their sonic extracts (se) were prepared. the cytotoxic assay of each se for mc3t3-e1 cell was used with respect to the morphological cell changes and [3h]-thymidine uptake. the following results were obtained: 1. four obligately anaerobic bacteria were identified as follows: porphyromonas asaccharolytica (p. a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. n.), eubacterium lentum (e. l.), and peptostreptococcus micros (p. m.). 2. the protein concentrations which induced the morphological cell changes differed in each se. the se from p. m. caused cell abnormalities at 10 micrograms protein/ml, f. n. and e. l., at 30 micrograms protein/ml, and p. a., at 100 micrograms protein/ml. 3. the inhibition of the incorporation of [3h]-thymidine into dna was concentration-dependent. the se of p. a. showed less cytotoxicity than the others at lower concentrations; 3, 10, 30 micrograms protein/ml. the se from f. n. had more cytotoxicity at higher concentrations; 100, 300 micrograms protein/ml. these results suggest that these  bacterial sonic extracts have a potential to cause morphological cell changes and inhibit the cell proliferation in different concentrations.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
