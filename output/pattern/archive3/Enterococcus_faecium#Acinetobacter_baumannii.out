bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against eskape bacteria.
more information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (phmg) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. the bactericidal properties of phmg and chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant eskape pathogens. results showed that phmg exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp. than chg. a slight bactericidal advantage over chg was obtained against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in previous reports, phmg had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested gram-negative bacteria and several gram-positive bacteria than chg using mic test. these studies support the further development of covalently bound phmg in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of phmg in novel disinfectant formulas.
could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates collected from the middle east and africa between 2004 and 2011.
the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. in this study, susceptibility among gram-positive and gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the middle east and africa was examined. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution methods. us food and drug administration (fda)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. in total, 2967 gram-positive and 6322 gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. all staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. all enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of escherichia coli and 32.9% of klebsiella pneumoniae. more than 95% of e. coli and enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. the most active agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the mic90 (mic required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against a. baumannii was low at 2mg/l. tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most gram-negative pathogens. tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most gram-positive pathogens from the middle east and africa.
antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 1,141), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in taiwan. mics of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast-2011). among drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, all of the prsp isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (mic(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one mrsa isolate (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three vre isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. among the gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for esbl-producing e. coli (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae (mic(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by fda criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by eucast-2011 criteria. the susceptibility rate for a. baumannii (mic(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. a bimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible a. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible a. baumannii isolates. in taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of a. baumannii.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
in vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against resistant gram-negative bacilli and enterococci by time-kill assay.
this time-kill study was performed with 65 genetically unique clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and enterococci to further define the antibacterial activity of tigecycline. to our knowledge, this is the largest published time-kill study evaluating tigecycline activity to date. isolates evaluated were 10 meropenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii; 15 escherichia coli, including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers; 15 klebsiella pneumoniae, including 10 esbl producers; 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), including 10 that were linezolid resistant; and 5 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis. time-kill testing was performed using tigecycline concentrations of 1x, 2x, and 4x mic with colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. tigecycline mics (microg/ml) were < or =1 for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, regardless of the isolates' esbl production; a. baumannii, 0.06 to 4; 9/10 (90%) were < or =2; e. faecalis < or =0.12; and vre < or =0.25, regardless of linezolid susceptibility. in the time-kill assay, tigecycline significantly inhibited bacterial growth when compared with the growth control. the reduction in growth was <3 log(10) cfu/ml for all isolates, indicative of a bacteriostatic effect.
tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.
update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the united states: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) 2005 to 2007.
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (ttest) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. objective: the aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the united states in 2005, 2006, and 2007. methods: isolates were collected from 172 centers across the united states.in vitro activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines and clsi or us food and drug administration interpretive criteria. results: overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. for the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. one exception was acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for esbl-pproducing escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/l against non-esbl-producing k pneumoniae, k oxytoca, e coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and a baumannii. against methicillin susceptible and -resistant s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline mic(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/l. conclusions: this report of 3 years of data from the test study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for a baumannii. tigecycline continued to have good activity against enterobacteriaceae, a baumannii, s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and s agalactiae.
inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
a comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
this article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for mrsa and csssi. while not available in the u.s., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) infections but inhibits cytochrome p450 a3p4, and has only modest activity against mrsa pneumonia. daptomycin effectively treats csssi but not pneumonia caused by mrsa, and is effective against all strains of staphylococcus. linezolid, available orally and intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, csssi, and infections caused by mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and vree tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the fda to treat csssi and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. dalbavancin, effective against mrsa and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action and is effective against mrsa and gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against mrsa, has few side effects. oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus and enterococci. ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat clostridium difficile colitis.
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
