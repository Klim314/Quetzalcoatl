TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity of head and neck space infections of odontogenic origin.
AB  == this paper aim to assess the anatomical spaces of head and neck region and causative microorganisms responsible for infections, evaluate the resistance of antibiotics used in treatment and compare the findings with previously reported microbial flora in the orofacial infection. forty-two patients were recorded. all underwent surgical incision and drainage, received antibiotics cover, and had culture and sensitivity test performed for gram positive and gram negative aerobes. there were 33 male (78.57 %) and 9 female (21.42 %). out of the 42 patients 28 (66.66 %) presented with single space involvement. the submandibular  space was the most frequent location for single space abscess (28.12 %). fourteen patients presented with multiple space involvement, with a total of 64 spaces being involved. forty microorganisms were isolated. there were 28 aerobes and 10  anaerobes. two fungi were also identified. the most common bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus. the key  issue here, which needs to be remembered, is that antibiotics alone cannot resolve odontogenic infection satisfactorily. quick recovery of patients results  with proper basic management comprising of early drainage/decompression which is  equally important.

TI  == diagnosis of gas gangrene: does a discrepancy exist between the published data and practice.
AB  == the infectious disease society of america has defined gas gangrene as an infection caused by clostridium species. however, in many clinical settings, soft tissue infections that produce subcutaneous gas have been diagnosed as gas gangrene without identification of the presence of clostridium species. instead,  the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic findings. a chart review was performed of 25 consecutive patients treated at the atlantic health system for infections of the lower extremity that were diagnosed as gas gangrene. wound cultures from the 25 patients grew 31 different species of bacteria. the most prevalent organism was staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 17 of 31 (54.84%) different organisms identified and 19.77% of 86 separate aerobic or anaerobic cultures. the most prevalent genus was streptococcus, which accounted for 20 (64.52%) of the organisms identified and 23.26% of the cultures. the most  prevalent anaerobic genus was peptostreptococcus, which accounted for 8 (25.81%)  of the organisms identified and 9.3% of the cultures. none of the cultures grew clostridium species. these findings showed that gas-forming soft tissue infections of the lower extremity, commonly diagnosed as gas gangrene, are rarely caused by clostridium species.

TI  == in vivo proton mr spectroscopy in uterine abscesses.
AB  == it is important to make a rapid diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment, however, specific diagnosis of causative organisms of pelvic abscesses on conventional mr imaging is difficult. mr spectroscopy provides metabolic information noninvasively, and has the potential to characterize etiology of the  abscesses. the presence of acetate (ac) peak with or without succinate (suc) peak may suggest anaerobic bacterial infection, whereas the absence of ac and suc peaks in the spectra may suggest aerobic infection. this report describes two cases of uterine pyogenic abscesses, which showed ac and suc peaks on in vivo mr  spectroscopy.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == regioselective covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody-binding proteins a, g, and l for construction of antibody arrays.
AB  == immobilized antibodies are useful for the detection of antigens in highly sensitive microarray diagnostic applications. arrays with the antibodies attached regioselectively in a uniform orientation are typically more sensitive than those with random orientations. direct regioselective immobilization of antibodies on a solid support typically requires a modified form of the protein. we now report a  general approach for the regioselective attachment of antibodies to a surface using truncated forms of antibody-binding proteins a, g, and l that retain the structural motifs required for antibody binding. the recombinant proteins have a  c-terminal cvix protein farnesyltransferase recognition motif that allows us to append a bioorthogonal azide or alkyne moiety and use the cu(i)-catalyzed huisgen cycloaddition to attach the binding proteins to a suitably modified glass surface. this approach offers several advantages. the recombinant antibody-binding proteins are produced in escherichia coli, chemoselectively modified posttranslationally in the cell-free homogenate, and directly attached to the glass surface without the need for purification at any stage of the process. complexes between immobilized recombinant proteins a, g, and l and their respective strongly bound antibodies were stable to repeated washing with pbst buffer at ph 7.2. however, the antibodies could be stripped from the slides by treatment with 0.1 m glycine.hcl buffer, ph 2.6, for 30 min and regenerated by shaking with pbs buffer, ph 7.2, at 4 degrees c overnight. the recombinant forms  of proteins a, g, and l can be used separately or in combination to give glass surfaces capable of binding a wide variety of antibodies.

TI  == incorporating into a calpha go model the effects of geometrical restriction on calpha atoms caused by side chain orientations.
AB  == coarse-grained go models have been widely used for studying protein-folding mechanisms. despite the simplicity of the model, these can reproduce the essential features of the folding process of a protein. however, it is also known that side chains significantly contribute to the folding mechanism. hence, it is  desirable to incorporate the side chain effects into a coarse-grained go model. in this study, to distinguish the effects of side chain orientation and to understand how these effects contribute to folding mechanisms, we incorporate into a calpha go model not only heterogeneous contact energies but also geometrical restraints around two calpha atoms in contact with each other. we confirm that the heterogeneity of contact energies governs the folding pathway of a protein and that the geometric constraints attributed to side chains reproduce  cooperative transitions in folding.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  == background/aim: infected total knee arthroplasty (tka) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. the aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following tka. methods: this retrospective study of infected tkas was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the orthopedics & traumatology clinic of the military medical academy (mma) in belgrade. a total of 654 primary and revised tkas were performed in the  said period. we registered and surgically treated 28 infected tkas (primary tkas: mma--22, other institutions--6). the incidence of tka infection in the mma was 3.36%. the most common pathogens were: staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. other isolated pathogens were: enterococcus  faecalis, klebsiella pneum., klebsiella spp., streptoccocus viridans, seratia spp, micrococcus luteus and peptostreptococcus spp. in one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. we analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected tkas. results: in our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. conclusion: two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected tka, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. the antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most  cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.

TI  == assessment of microbial diversity in biofilms recovered from endotracheal tubes using culture dependent and independent approaches.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a common nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients. biofilm formation is one of the mechanisms through which the endotracheal tube (et) facilitates bacterial contamination of the lower airways. in the present study, we analyzed the composition of the et biofilm flora by means of culture dependent and culture independent (16 s rrna gene clone libraries and pyrosequencing) approaches. overall, the microbial diversity was high and members of different phylogenetic lineages were detected (actinobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, candida spp., clostridia, epsilon-proteobacteria, firmicutes, fusobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria). culture dependent analysis, based on the use of selective growth media and conventional microbiological tests, resulted in the identification of typical aerobic nosocomial pathogens which are known to play a role in the development of vap, e.g. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. other opportunistic pathogens were also identified, including staphylococcus epidermidis and kocuria  varians. in general, there was little correlation between the results obtained by sequencing 16 s rrna gene clone libraries and by cultivation. pyrosequencing of pcr amplified 16 s rrna genes of four selected samples resulted in the identification of a much wider variety of bacteria. the results from the pyrosequencing analysis suggest that these four samples were dominated by members of the normal oral flora such as prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and lactic acid bacteria. a combination of methods is recommended to obtain a complete picture of the microbial diversity of the et biofilm.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

AB  == vulvar abscesses can progress to cause significant illness requiring disfiguring  surgical debridement, broad spectrum antibiotics, and require hospitalization. a  retrospective review of de-identified charts of 13 patients admitted for inpatient care for vulvar abscesses from 2004-2009 at west virginia university hospitals was conducted. risk factors for vulvar abscess in these patients included obesity and diabetes. body mass index (bmi) is directly proportionate to the size of the abscess and increased risk of intensive care unit admission. most patients did not seek medical care prior to hospital admission. polymicrobial infections were common, and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus was seen  in two cases. the presence of multiple risk factors increased the length of hospitalization. clinicians should be aware of these risk factors and initiate aggressive therapy for patients with elevated bmi or multiple risk factors.

TI  == primary sternal osteomyelitis due to peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == primary sternal osteomyelitis (pso) is a rare syndrome. in adults, it usually occurs with underlying predisposing factors, such as immunodeficiency, or intravenous (iv) drug abuse. the infecting organism in these patients is usually  staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa. peptostreptococcus species are gram-positive anaerobic cocci and are part of the normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces. peptostreptococcus infection can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, bone, joint, and soft tissue. here, we report on a 32-year-old previously healthy chinese man who was diagnosed with pso and p. anaerobius was yielded in the bacterial culture. he was treated empirically with antibiotics, but these failed. after additional limited surgical intervention with debridement, the pso was cured.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. in this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from  chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus (27) and streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (31) and prevotella species (30). haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. overall, 22 % of staphylococcus aureus isolates  were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics in alloplastic  total temporomandibular joint replacement surgery: a survey and preliminary guidelines.
AB  == purpose: in 2009, the american academy of orthopedic surgeons recommended lifelong prophylaxis after orthopedic total joint replacement (tjr) before these  patients undergo dental, aerodigestive, genitourinary (gu), and gastrointestinal  (gi) procedures. because oral and maxillofacial surgeons worldwide are implanting alloplastic total temporomandibular joint replacements (tmj tjrs), it appeared reasonable to survey these surgeons to obtain data that might shed some light, not only on this issue, but also to obtain some data to begin to develop preliminary guidelines for the peri- and postoperative use of antibiotics for tmj tjr using these results and the orthopedic data. materials and methods: a total of 35 surgeons worldwide, members of either the tmj concepts or biomet microfixation online networks were e-mailed a standard questionnaire surveying their perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics for their tmj tjr cases. results: of the 35 surgeons, 26 (74.2%) from 8 different countries responded. a total of 2,476 cases (3,368 joints) were retrospectively surveyed. of the responding surgeons, 96.2% used, in order of frequency, cefazolin, clindamycin, cephalosporin, or penicillin-based antibiotics in the perioperative  period and continued their use for a mean of 7 days (range 5 to 14) postoperatively. also, 46.2% soaked the tjr components either in the perioperative antibiotic or in vancomycin, poviodine, gentamycin, or peroxide before implantation. in addition, 61.5% irrigated the wounds after device implantation with bacitracin, vancomycin, poviodine, peroxide, or the perioperative antibiotic. these surgeons reported that 51 joints (1.51%) had become infected within a mean of 6 months (range 2 weeks to 12 years) postoperatively. a total of 32 devices (0.95%) required removal and/or replacement. in cases in which the organisms were isolated, the organisms commonly associated with biofilm infection of tjr devices, staphylococcus aureus, s epidermidis, peptostreptococcus, and pseudamonas aeruginosa, were cultured. in  only 1 joint (0.003%) was there a suggestion of an association with an invasive dental/aerodigestive, gu/gi procedure. regarding prophylaxis after tmj tjrs and before dental/aerodigestive, gu, or gi procedures, 53.8% of the respondents reported that they provided prophylaxis. of these, 1 recommended doing this for 6 months and 4 for 2 years, such as has been the american dental association/american academy of orthopedic surgeons recommendation since 2003; and 9 reported they believe these tmj tjr patients should have lifetime antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental/aerodigestive, gu, or gi procedures. conclusion: the evidence provided from the present small study survey and a review of the orthopedic data could provide the opportunity to develop guidelines for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic management for tmj tjrs and spur additional research into this important area of  patient management.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == marginal zone b-cells, a gatekeeper of innate immunity.
AB  == to maintain the integrity of an organism constantly challenged by pathogens, the  immune system is endowed with a variety of cell types. b lymphocytes were initially thought to only play a role in the adaptive branch of immunity. however, a number of converging observations revealed that two b-cell subsets, marginal zone (mz) and b1 cells, exhibit unique developmental and functional characteristics, and can contribute to innate immune responses. in addition to their capacity to mount a local antibody response against type-2 t-cell-independent (ti-2) antigens, mz b-cells can participate to t-cell-dependent (td) immune responses through the capture and import of blood-borne antigens to follicular areas of the spleen. here, we discuss the multiple roles of mz b-cells in humans, non-human primates, and rodents. we also  summarize studies - performed in transgenic mice expressing fully human antibodies on their b-cells and in macaques whose infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) represents a suitable model for hiv-1 infection in humans - showing that infectious agents have developed strategies to subvert mz b-cell functions. in these two experimental models, we observed that two microbial superantigens for b-cells (protein a from staphylococcus aureus and protein l from peptostreptococcus magnus) as well as inactivated at-2 virions of  hiv-1 and infectious siv preferentially deplete innate-like b-cells - mz b-cells  and/or b1 b-cells - with different consequences on ti and td antibody responses.  these data revealed that viruses and bacteria have developed strategies to deplete innate-like b-cells during the acute phase of infection and to impair the antibody response. unraveling the intimate mechanisms responsible for targeting mz b-cells in humans will be important for understanding disease pathogenesis and for designing novel vaccine strategies.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  == background and objectives: since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. the study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide eugenol, vitapex and metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly  from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. method: microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. the microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using agar diffusion technique. results: were statistically analyzed using one-way anova. facultative/aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. zoe showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by vitapex, calcium hydroxide and metapex in descending order. conclusion: our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. in vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of  any of the test filling material.

TI  == normal bacterial flora from vaginas of criollo limonero cows.
AB  == in order to describe the normal bacterial flora in vaginas of criollo limonero cows, 51 healthy multiparous cows, at least 90-day postpartum, were selected. duplicated swabs (n = 102) were taken from the vaginal fornix of cows to perform  aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as conventional biochemical tests. out of  102 swabs, bacterial growth was obtained in 55 (53.9%) while the remaining 47 (46.1%) did not exhibited any bacterial growth. of the 55 bacterial growths, 23 (41.8%) were aerobic whereas 32 (58.1%) were anaerobic. likewise, 29 (52.72%) of  bacterial growths were pure and 26 (47.27%) were mixed. under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, gram positive bacteria were predominant (81.82% and 73.08%, respectively) over gram negative bacteria (18.18% and 26.92%, respectively). isolated bacteria were arcanobacterium pyogenes (22.92%), staphylococcus aureus (15.63%), staphylococcus coagulase negative (17.71%), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (6.25%), bacteroides spp. (13.54%), and peptostreptococcus spp. (7.29%). in conclusion, normal vaginal bacterial flora of criollo limonero cows was predominantly gram positive and included a. pyogenes, s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus, e. rhusiopathiae, bacteroides spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. in criollo limonero cattle, adaptive aspects such as development of humoral and physical mechanisms for defense, and bacterial adaptation to host deserve research attention.

TI  == encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis: a single-center experience and review of the  literature.
AB  == encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (eps) is a serious and often fatal complication of long-term pd with severe malnutrition and poor prognosis. it causes progressive obstruction and encapsulation of the bowel. this retrospective study reviews our experience and that reviewed in the literature concerning eps.  it refers to a total of 1966 patients treated with chronic pd between 1974 and 2008. twenty one of them (1.1%) developed eps, with the incidence increasing with the duration of pd. mean age of our patients with eps was 43, ranging from 18 to  71 years, 8 were men and 13 women with a mean body mass index (bmi) of 21.6 kg/m(2). only one patient had type ii diabetes, 15 patients had glomerular disease, and six of these 15 had an autoimmune disease such as wegener's granulomatosis and sle. thirteen patients developed eps while on pd, 7 within 2 years after transfer to hd, and only one after renal transplantation. however, 7  patients had a previous renal transplant before returning to pd and subsequently  developing eps. interestingly, we did not observe more episodes of eps after transplantation. in the patients who developed eps, the peritonitis rate over the period of observation was 1/15.6 pt-months and was due to staphylococcus aureus,  coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas and fungi. a history of peritonitis was not a prerequisite for developing eps, since one patient had no episodes of peritonitis and 4 had just one previous episode. fifteen patients presented with peritonitis within 4 months before the diagnosis of eps with particularly virulent micro-organisms such as s. aureus, candida, pseudomonas, corynebacterium, and peptostreptococcus. eleven patients were treated with hypertonic dextrose solutions (4.25 g/dl of dextrose) and seven with icodextrin,  indirectly suggesting problems with ultrafiltration. nine of 21 patients were on  beta-blockers. the diagnosis of eps was made either surgically or radiologically  with signs of small bowel obstruction in combination with severe malnutrition. eleven of our patients (52%) had evidence of small bowel obstruction and 14 patients required total parenteral nutrition (tpn). tamoxifen (10-20 mg daily) was started in 6 patients, 4 of whom are alive and 2 deceased 3 and 5 years after eps was diagnosed. of the 12 patients who were not given tamoxifen, 2 are alive and 10 died. no side effects of tamoxifen were reported. only 7 of our patients (33%) died during the first year after the diagnosis of eps. currently, 4 patients are on hd and 3 have had a renal transplant. six patients of the fourteen who underwent surgery (42.8%) died within the first 6 months after operation and five died after an average of 6.6 years, mostly due to cardiovascular causes, three are still alive. as eps becomes more prevalent with  longer duration of pd, large multicenter prospective studies are needed to establish its incidence and identify risk factors, therapeutic approach, and prognosis.

TI  == notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == the bacteriology of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps.
AB  == objective: to compare the bacteriologic findings in ethmoidal biopsy specimens and nasal lavage samples from healthy control patients and from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) with nasal polyps (crsnp+) and without nasal polyps  (crsnp-). design: comparative microbiologic investigation. setting: university hospital. patients: the study included 31 crsnp+ patients, 13 crsnp- patients, and 21 control patients. intervention: aerobe and anaerobe bacterial culture of nasal lavage samples and biopsy specimens of anterior ethmoidal mucosa. main outcome measure: analysis of biopsy specimens from 65 patients and nasal lavage samples from 63 patients. results: mixed cultures of aerobe and anaerobe bacteria were mainly detected in the biopsy specimens. the most common aerobe bacteria found in the biopsy specimens were coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacterium species, staphylococcus aureus, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci. propionibacterium and peptostreptococcus species were the most common anaerobes.  pathogenic bacteria such as s. aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae were detected in biopsy specimens from 16 of 31 crsnp+ patients (52%), 4 of 13 crsnp- patients (31%), and 10 of 21 control patients (48%). there were no significant differences in the bacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens between the 3 patient groups (p >.30). the majority of bacteria detected in the biopsy specimens were also detected in the corresponding lavage samples; however, in 35% of patients, pathogenic bacteria were found only in nasal lavage samples and not  in corresponding biopsy specimens. conclusions: there are no significant differences in the bacteriologic features of ethmoidal biopsy specimens between crsnp+, crsnp-, and control patients. therefore, a bacteriologic pathogenesis of  the polyps in crsnp+ patients seems unlikely. the general use of antibiotics in patients with crs appears questionable. investigation of nasal lavage samples is  not suitable for predicting the bacteriologic features of inflamed sinuses of patients with crs.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant obligate anaerobes during exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are thought to cause the majority of lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). however, other bacterial pathogens may contribute to the pathophysiology of lung disease. here,  obligate anaerobes were identified in a cross-sectional study, and cell numbers and antibiotic susceptibilities of facultative and obligate anaerobes from 114 sputum samples from nine children and 36 adults with cf were determined. furthermore, in 12 cf patients, we investigated whether conventional intravenous  antibiotic therapy, administered during acute exacerbations, would affect the numbers of obligate anaerobes. fifteen genera of obligate anaerobes were identified in 91% of the cf patients. cell numbers (mean: 2.2 x 10(7) +/- standard deviation 6.9 x 10(7) cfu/ml of sputum sample) were comparable to those  of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. staphylococcus saccharolyticus and peptostreptococcus prevotii were most prevalent. infection with p. aeruginosa did not increase the likelihood that obligate anaerobes are present in sputum specimens. single obligate anaerobic species persisted for up to 11 months in sputum plugs in vivo. patients with and without obligate anaerobes in sputum specimens did not differ in lung function. intravenous therapy directed against p. aeruginosa during acute exacerbations increased lung function, but did not reduce the numbers of obligate anaerobes. obligate anaerobic species differed widely in their patterns of resistance against meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftazidime. in 58% of patients with acute exacerbations, obligate anaerobes were detected that were resistant to the antibiotics used for treatment. antibiotic therapy, optimized to target anaerobes in addition to p. aeruginosa, may improve the management of cf lung disease.

TI  == polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic foot ulcer biofilm infections determined using bacterial tag encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap).
AB  == background: diabetic extremity ulcers are associated with chronic infections. such ulcer infections are too often followed by amputation because there is little or no understanding of the ecology of such infections or how to control or eliminate this type of chronic infection. a primary impediment to the healing of  chronic wounds is biofilm phenotype infections. diabetic foot ulcers are the most common, disabling, and costly complications of diabetes. here we seek to derive a better understanding of the polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic extremity ulcer infections. methods and findings: using a new bacterial tag encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) approach we have evaluated the bacterial diversity of 40 chronic diabetic foot ulcers from different patients. the most prevalent bacterial genus associated with diabetic chronic wounds was corynebacterium spp. findings also show that obligate anaerobes including bacteroides, peptoniphilus, fingoldia, anaerococcus, and peptostreptococcus spp.  are ubiquitous in diabetic ulcers, comprising a significant portion of the wound  biofilm communities. other major components of the bacterial communities included commonly cultured genera such as streptococcus, serratia, staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. conclusions: in this article, we highlight the patterns of population diversity observed in the samples and introduce preliminary evidence to support the concept of functional equivalent pathogroups (fep). here we introduce fep as consortia of genotypically distinct bacteria that symbiotically  produce a pathogenic community. according to this hypothesis, individual members  of these communities when they occur alone may not cause disease but when they coaggregate or consort together into a fep the synergistic effect provides the functional equivalence of well-known pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, giving the biofilm community the factors necessary to maintain chronic biofilm infections. further work is definitely warranted and needed in order to prove whether the feps concept is a viable hypothesis. the findings here also suggest that traditional culturing methods may be extremely biased as a diagnostic tool as they select for easily cultured organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and against difficult to culture bacteria such as anaerobes. while pcr methods also have bias, further work is now needed in comparing traditional culture results to high-resolution molecular diagnostic methods such as btefap.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == moraxella catarrhalis-dependent tonsillar b cell activation does not lead to apoptosis but to vigorous proliferation resulting in nonspecific igm production.
AB  == the respiratory pathogen moraxella catarrhalis has a high affinity for human igd  and is mitogenic for peripheral blood b lymphocytes. moraxella igd-binding protein, which is a multifunctional outer membrane protein with adhesive properties, is responsible for the interaction. previous experiments with the ig-binding b cell superantigens protein a and protein l from staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus magnus, respectively, have suggested that nonimmune bcr cross-linking induces b cell apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. the goal of this study was to characterize early and late b cell events in the presence of m. catarrhalis in comparison with s. aureus. despite an increased phosphatidyl serine translocation as revealed by annexin v binding in flow cytometry analyses, neither m. catarrhalis nor s. aureus induced activation-associated apoptotic cell death in purified human tonsillar b cells. in contrast, a vigorous b cell proliferation, as quantified using thymidine incorporation and cfse staining, was observed. an increased expression of an array of surface proteins (i.e., cd19, cd21, cd40, cd45, cd54, cd69, cd86, cd95,  and hla-dr) and igm production was found upon activation with m. catarrhalis. in  conclusion, m. catarrhalis-dependent b cell activation does not result in apoptosis but in cell division and nonspecific igm synthesis, suggesting that the bacterial interaction with tonsillar b cells serves to redirect the early adaptive immune response.

TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == [microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  == qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. bacteriological study of gastric biopsies  and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, s. pyogenes (group a), peptostreptococcus anaerobius, p. prevotii and their associations. in 20 studied patients with h.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. study showed that eradication of h.  pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of candida albicans.

TI  == microbiological and immunological study of staphylococcus vaccine effects in periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of the staphylococcal vaccine inoculated subcutaneously in 15 patients with chronic periodontitis. bacteriological investigation of samples collected from the periodontal pocket for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms was performed by classic bacteriological procedures before and after vaccination. the following immune system parameters were evaluated: c reactive protein (crp), serum level of c3 complement fraction, igg, iga, and igm by immunodiffusion, pmn granulocytes ros release after in vitro stimulation with opsonized zymosan (oz) and concanavalin a (cona) by chemiluminescence assay and lymphocytes sets and subsets by flow-cytometry immunophenotyping. the microbiological investigations revealed  high frequency of staphylococcus spp isolation and the presence of the most common anaerobe agents incriminated in human periodontitis like fusobacterium, porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus, veillonella spp and the reduction of this flora in the periodontal pocket after therapy. the immunological parameters quantification showed the absence of crp, normal values of c3, igg, iga, igm in the majority of cases. all patients presented normal values of lymphocytes sets and subsets. significant increase of pmn respiratory burst after cona stimulation was observed before vaccination which turned to normal values after therapy and a low ros level both before and after therapy suggesting pmn fc receptors dysfunction in this group of patients. the data presented in our study suggest an immunomodulatory effect of staphylococcal vaccine therapy in periodontitis and high frequency of staphylococcus spp recovering from the periodontal pocket of investigated subjects.

TI  == exploitation of host signaling pathways by b cell superantigens--potential strategies for developing targeted therapies in systemic autoimmunity.
AB  == some infectious agents produce molecules capable of interacting specifically with the immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain variable regions, independently of the conventional-binding site. they are referred to as b cell superantigens (sags) and include protein a of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), gp120 of hiv-1, and protein l of peptostreptococcus magnus (p. magnus). in contrast to conventional antigens, b cell superantigens interact with conserved framework regions of immunoglobulins and can target a large proportion of b cells. in experimental models, they have been demonstrated to deplete b cell subsets responsible for innate functions, namely b-1a and marginal zone (mz) b cells. as a result, the interactions of these superantigens with host cells impair the humoral immune response. in addition to providing clues toward understanding host-pathogen interactions and microbial pathogenesis, b cell superantigens represent potential therapeutic agents that could be used to specifically modulate expansion of b cell subsets in diseased subjects. in systemic autoimmune diseases, for example,  there is activation and expansion of b cells that secrete pathogenic autoantibodies. their depletion results in clinical improvement in both experimental animals and patients. currently, attempts are being made to specifically deplete pathogenic autoantibody-producing b cells. since b-1a and mz b cells have been found to be expanded in autoimmune disorders, b cell superantigens, used alone or in combination with other biological agents, may have beneficial effects in autoimmune disease management.

TI  == b cell superantigens subvert innate functions of b cells.
AB  == some infectious agents produce molecules capable of interacting specifically with the immunoglobulin variable regions, independently of the conventional binding site. they are referred to as b cell superantigens, and include protein a of staphylococcus aureus, protein l of peptostreptococcus magnus, and gp120 of hiv-1. to test their effects in vivo, we used transgenic mice whose immunoglobulin loci were inactivated and their humoral immune system had been restored by introduction of human immunoglobulin loci. we found that administration of soluble recombinant b cell superantigens can deplete b cell subsets in vivo. they also preferentially impact b cell subpopulations responsible for innate-like functions. the studies indicate that certain pathogens have evolved primarily to subvert innate functions of b cells.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == analysis of microbial etiology and mortality in patients with brain abscess.
AB  == objectives: despite the technological advancements in diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures, brain abscess continues to remain a potentially fatal central nervous system infection. in a prospective study we determined the predisposing factors and the microbiological profile of brain abscess. we also analyzed the mortality in patients with the type of infections identified. methods: over a period of 8 years (1997-2004), aspirated pus from 118 patients with brain abscess was directly inoculated into bactec plus+ aerobic and bactec plus+ anaerobic media immediately after collection and subcultured on solid media as appropriate. predisposing factors, if any, were recorded in all patients. mortality of patients during hospital stay was correlated with the type of infections identified. results: predisposing factors were identified in 94 (79.7%) patients, otogenic infection being the most common (37/118; 31.4%). microorganisms were demonstrated in 96 (81.4%) patients, by culture in 89 (75.4%) patients and by gram stain in 7 (5.9%) additional cases. a total of 105 organisms were isolated - 67 (63.8%) aerobes, 32 (30.5%) anaerobes, 5 (4.8%) mycobacteria and 1 (0.9%) fungus. viridans streptococci (23.8%), staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), bacteroides fragilis group/species and peptostreptococcus species (10.5% each) were the common isolates. overall mortality was 14.4%; patients with gram-negative infections had higher mortality than gram-positive infections (6/20; 30% vs. 6/63; 9.5%; p=0.02). conclusions: culture of pus immediately after aspiration in an automated system yields good results. gram stain coupled with culture can guide the neurosurgeons better to treat their patients more rationally. patients with gram-negative infections need special attention in terms of management because of high mortality rate.

TI  == bacterial etiology of diabetic foot infections in south india.
AB  == background: foot infections are a frequent complication of patients with diabetes mellitus, accounting for up to 20% of diabetes-related hospital admissions. infectious agents are associated with the worst outcomes, which may ultimately lead to amputation of the infected foot unless prompt treatment strategies are ensued. the present study sought to reveal the bacterial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers in south india, the diabetic capital of india. methods: a 10-month-long descriptive study was carried out to analyse the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates of all patients admitted with diabetic foot infections presenting with wagner grade 2-5 ulcers. bacteriological diagnosis and antibiotic sensitivity profiles were carried out and analysed using standard procedures. results: diabetic polyneuropathy was found to be common (56.8%) and gram-negative bacteria (57.6%) were isolated more often than gram-positive ones (42.3%) in the patients screened. the most frequent bacterial isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and enterobacteriaceaes. forty-nine cultures (68%) showed polymicrobial involvement. about 44% of p. aeruginosa were multi-drug-resistant, and mrsa was recovered on eight occasions (10.3%). bacteroides spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were the major anaerobic isolates. conclusions: our study supports the viewpoint put forth by previous south indian authors that the distribution of gram-negative bacteria (57.6%) is more common than that of gram-positive ones (42.3%) and it is contrary to the viewpoint that diabetic foot infections are frequently monomicrobial. furthermore, recovery of multi-drug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates is of serious concern, as almost no one has reported the same from the south indian milieu.

AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  == this aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various nigerian chewing sticks. aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of c. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in  nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. all the extracts demonstrated activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates. over half of the extracts were active against enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including prevotella melaninogenica, porphyromonas gigivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus prevotii. extracts of the vitellaria paradoxa root, bridellia  ferruginea stem and twigs, garcinia cola stem, terminalia glaucescens root, morinda lucida root, and cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. the extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  == background: linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant  skin/soft tissue pathogens. objective: to study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens  in obese patients. methods: we obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid  600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. these samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/ml) and  one strain each of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) (mic 2.0 microg/ml), bacteroides fragilis (mic 2.0 microg/ml), and peptostreptococcus magnus (mic 1.0 microg/ml). serum inhibitory titers (sits) and bactericidal titers (sbts) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. results: mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/ml at these respective time points. median sits for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of mrsa (mic 4.0 microg/ml); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median sbts were observed against one isolate of mrsa (mic 1.0 microg/ml) as well as the strain of vre and p. magnus. conclusions: serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. one treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (mic > or =4.0  microg/ml) strain of s. aureus. bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.

TI  == microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group a streptococcus ( streptococcus pyogenes ), staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae . anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while s. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. more than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. however, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

TI  == surgical infections: a microbiological study.
AB  == surgical infections are mostly polymicrobial, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. one hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n=51), secondary peritonitis (n=25), necrotizing fascitis (n=22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n=19) were studied. the number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2.32). the aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0.81 in secondary peritonitis and 1.8 in necrotizing fascitis. most secondary peritonitis (80%), necrotizing fascitis (75%) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66.7%) were polymicrobial. common microorganisms isolated in our study were e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. the most effective antibiotics for s. aureus were clindamycin (79.1%) and cefuroxime (70.8%). for gram-negatives (klebsiella spp., e. coli and proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime,  ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35.2%) and ciprofloxacin (35.2%). the greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in p. aeruginosa (52.9%), followed by klebsiella spp. (33.3%), proteus spp. (33.3%), e. coli (22.2%), and s. aureus (12.5%). all the anaerobes that we isolated were 100% sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95% to 100%). apart from antibiotic therapy, non-antimicrobial methods, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement also play an important role in the treatment of surgical  infections.

TI  == intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. they often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. the original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group  peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. the treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology,  and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == [bacterial infections in chronic otitis media--usefulness of molecular diagnostics based on pcr method].
AB  == infections in chronic otitis media (com) are common, and identification of their  pathogen is difficult, what is proven by high rate of negative results of bacteriological examinations. this fact may be explained by two factors: it is difficult to obtain a reliable material for culture and classic methods of bacteriological cultures may be of low sensitivity. amplification of bacterial dna in pcr is an examination, that leads to a higher effectiveness and sensitivity of bacteriological tests. the authors present material of 53 patients with com, previously untreated, in which bacteriological examinations by classic  and molecular pcr method were performed. the results of both methods were compared. in classic method the presence of pathogens was observed in 46 of 53 cases (86.8%). the most often isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.8% of the cases), staphylococcus aureus (15.1%), peptostreptococcus sp. and fusobacterium sp. (11.3% of the cases each) and proteus mirabilis (7.5%). in 7 cases (13.2%) bacteriological results were negative. using molecular diagnostic of pcr, the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 42 cases (79.2%).  isolated strains of p. aeruginosa were epidemiologically unrelated (93.7% of isolates), what was proven in pcr-finger-printing technique. the authors stated that predominant aerobes pathogens in com are p. aeruginosa and s. aureus and the pcr technique for identification of bacterial dna presence is very sensitive and  allows to precipitate diagnostics of patients with com. combination of classical  bacteriological tests with pcr technique may be very helpful in estimation bacteriological condition of patients with com.

TI  == microbiology of infected hemangiomas in children.
AB  == bacterial infections are a common complication of hemangiomas in children. the objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemangiomas. a retrospective 8-year review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected hemangiomas was carried out. specimens from infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was present in 32 of 38 specimens. aerobic bacteria alone were recovered in 12 infected hemangiomas (37.5%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (33%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 12 (37.5%). a total of 80 isolates (47 aerobes and 33 anaerobes) were recovered, giving an average of 2.5 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 1.0 anaerobes). the highest number of isolates were recovered in infections of the perineum (3.7 per site) and the legs (2.8 per site). the predominant aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterobacteriaceae. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp., gram-negative bacilli, and fusobacterium sp. organisms that belong to the mucous  membranes close to the lesions predominated in infections next to those membranes. the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected hemangiomas and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions is thereby demonstrated.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  == previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. we conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. most injuries were to the hands. fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. the median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. isolates included streptococcus anginosus (52%), staphylococcus aureus (30%), eikenella corrodens (30%), fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and prevotella melaninogenica (22%). candida species were found in 8%. fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, and candida species  were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. many strains of prevotella and s. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  == we studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. we recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. aerobes only were  recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group c beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), prevotella (22 [25.3%]), actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and veillonella (1 [1.1%]). beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). we found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem (mk-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 enterobacteriaceae, 15 aeromonas spp., 42 staphylococcus spp., 43 streptococcus spp., 15 enterococcus spp., 30 haemophilus  spp., 15 moraxella catarrhalis, 12 neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 clostridium spp., 12 peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group bacteroides recovered from four spanish hospitals. ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae  (mic(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded ampc betalactamase-producing strains. ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (mic(90) > or =16 mg/l). ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) < or =1 mg/l). in the case of haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a mic(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. when considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against clostridium spp. (mic(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l). both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.

TI  == immunoglobulin-binding domains: protein l from peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  == protein l is a multidomain cell-wall protein isolated from peptostreptococcus magnus. it belongs to a group of proteins that contain repeated domains that are  able to bind to igs without stimulating an immune response, the most characterized of this group being protein a ( staphylococcus aureus ) and protein g ( streptococcus ). both of these proteins bind predominantly to the interface of c(h)2-c(h)3 heavy chains, while protein l binds exclusively to the v(l) domain of the kappa -chain. the function of these proteins in vivo is not clear but it is thought that they enable the bacteria to evade the host's immune system. two binding sites for kappa -chain on a single ig-binding domain from protein l have  recently been reported and we give evidence that one site has a 25-55-fold higher affinity for kappa -chain than the second site.

AB  == background: uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. because these infections typically are confined to  the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and  resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens. objective: this paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. methods: two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each bid for 10 days. study 1 compared cefditoren with  cefuroxime; study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events. results: a total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. at the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in study 1 (p = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in study 2 (p = 0.018). eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for peptostreptococcus species in study 2 (p = 0.016 and p = 0.003, respectively). a  minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each p < 0.05). all 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to  moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache. conclusion:  in this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.

TI  == cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in newborns due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology and management of the major cutaneous and  subcutaneous infections in newborns where anaerobic bacteria predominate: omphalitis, necrotizing fasciitis, breast abscess, and scalp infection following  intrauterine fetal monitoring. the predominant bacteria known to cause these infections are group b streptococcus, group d enterococcus, group a streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic bacteria. all of these agents can colonize or infect the mother and subsequently colonize or infect the fetus or newborn either intrauterinely or during the passage through the birth canal. infections due to anaerobes are often polymicrobial, and include also aerobic and facultative bacteria. the anaerobes recovered from these infections are bacteroided fragilis group, fusobacterium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. early recognition and effective medical and surgical therapy are essential to recovery. managements of these infections include surgical debridement and drainage when appropriate as well as topical and systemic use of antimicrobial agents effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of suppurative sialadenitis.
AB  == aspirates of pus from acute suppurative sialadenitis were investigated for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 47 specimens, 32 from parotid, 9 from submandibular and 6 from sublingual glands yielded bacterial growth. fifty five isolates, 25 aerobic and 30 anaerobic, were isolated from parotid infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 13 (41%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 11 (34%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  bacteria in 8 (25%). of a total of 17 isolates, 8 aerobic and 9 anaerobic, from submandibular gland infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 3 (33%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 4 (44%) and mixed aerobic and  anaerobic bacteria in 2 (22%). ten isolates, 5 aerobic and 5 anaerobic, were from sublingual gland infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 2 (33%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 2 (33%) and mixed aerobic and  anaerobic bacteria in 2 (33%). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae while the predominant anaerobes were gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp.) and peptostreptococcus spp. the study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute suppurative sialadenitis.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces. materials and methods: the study  used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (a, b) of 40 teeth and  3 groups of 15 teeth (c, d, e). a defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 43719), eikenella corrodens (atcc 51724), or peptostreptococcus micros (atcc 33270). subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group a, b) or 55 and 75 (group c, d, e) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. the source of laser radiation was an er:yag laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. the number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. the statistical analysis was performed using anova followed by the scheffe-test.  results: depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the e. coli group was reduced by the er:yag laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser  pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the staph. aureus group to 15.1%. the number of bacteria in case of a. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in  case of e. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of p. micros to 22.0% after application  of 75 laser pulses. conclusion: besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on  root surfaces.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

(19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

AB  == azithromycin (zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in japan in march 2000. it showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. its activity against h. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. after oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of s. aureus. in experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. these pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.

AB  == the in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid), ampicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were examined and compared against 526 gram-positive bacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, were low (mic(90) = 0.5 mg/l), and were comparable with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. this compound was superior to the macrolides and highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains), with mic(90) = 2 mg/l. it was also active against other streptococci, with mic(90) = 4 mg/l. however, this agent is less active against enterococci (mic(90) = 32 mg/l). quinupristin/dalfopristin showed high activity against gram-positive anaerobes, including clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., with mic(90) < or = 2 mg/l. quinupristin/dalfopristin was also investigated for its post-antibiotic effect (pae) and bactericidal kinetics against nine strains of gram-positive organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. exponentially growing (log phase) cultures were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin at 2 x mic. growth kinetics was evaluated using viable  counting. the drug was uniformly bactericidal against pneumococci and staphylococci within 2 and 8 h of exposure, respectively. the killing activity against enterococci was weak; there was little or no reduction in bacterial count over 24 h of incubation. paes ranging from 2.13 to 3.28 h, 0.92 to 3.02 h and 1.89 to 7.07 h were produced on the tested pneumococci, staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. this study showed that quinupristin/dalfopristin is a  promising agent active against gram-positive bacteria. the prolonged paes also suggest that the drug could be used intermittently at more widely spaced dosing intervals against gram-positive organisms.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == correlation between microbiology and previous sinus surgery in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == aspirates of 108 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. there were 295 bacterial isolates: 109 aerobic and facultative, and 186 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus (17 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), moraxella catarrhalis (10), and haemophilus spp (8). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp (61), prevotella spp (45),  fusobacterium spp (15), and propionibacterium acnes (14). analysis of the medical histories revealed a correlation only between the microbial results and previous  sinus surgery. pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-negative aerobic bacilli (gnab) were more often isolated in patients who had surgery (9 of 33 patients had p aeruginosa and 17 had gnab) than in patients who did not have surgery (3 of 75 had p aeruginosa and 7 had gnab; p < .001). anaerobes were isolated more often in patients who did not have surgery (69 of 75 patients) than in those who had previous surgery (21 of 33 patients; p < .001). these findings illustrate the unique microbiological features of chronic maxillary sinusitis that persist after sinus surgery.

TI  == two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to staphylococcus aureus and rarely staphylococcus epidermidis, kingella kingae,  enterobacteriaciae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. patient 1. a 10-year-old male presented with  6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. the patient had a temperature of 104 degrees f. laboratory tests were within normal limits, except  for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), which was 58 mm/hour. blood culture showed no growth. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra  disk. there was no other abnormality. a computed tomography (ct)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic  and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and gram-positive cocci in chains. cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. the patient was treated with intravenous penicillin  600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every  6 hours for 3 weeks. the back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the esr returned  to normal at the end of therapy. follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. patient 2. an 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. he had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he  received no therapy. the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees f, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. laboratory tests were normal, except for  the esr (42 mm/hour). radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. a ct scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. ct-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform gram-negative bacilli.  anaerobic culture grew light growth of fusobacterium nucleatum. the organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. back pain resolved within 2 weeks. a 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. this report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. the lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. this is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. this was the case in our second patient, who was infected by f nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. the origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. the presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. the preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have  been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of f nucleatum. p magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. this report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

TI  == peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus renal abscess: a rare cause of fever of unknown origin.
AB  == renal abscess is uncommon in pediatrics and is rarely a cause of fever of unknown origin. we recently cared for a patient who presented with a 3-week history of fever. an indium scan ultimately led to the diagnosis of a renal abscess. aspiration yielded peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. this unusual case prompted a review of the clinical and microbiologic features of renal abscess in  pediatric patients at our hospital over the past 10 years. seven additional patients with a discharge diagnosis of renal abscess were identified. only 2 of the patients had identifiable risk factors (diabetes mellitus and polycystic kidneys). staphylococcus aureus or enterobacteriaceae were responsible for most infections, consistent with hematogenous and urinary tract sources, respectively. no other cases of anaerobic abscess were identified. this case highlights the importance of considering a renal abscess in the differential diagnosis of fever  of unknown origin and of processing specimens for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1997  and march 1998].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during the period from april 1997 to march 1998. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. a total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rate  of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic gram-positive bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated  from primary infections, followed by p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. we found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of s.  aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of enterococcus spp. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of b. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.

TI  == bacterial immunoglobulin superantigen proteins a and l activate human heart mast  cells by interacting with immunoglobulin e.
AB  == human heart mast cells (hhmc) have been identified in heart tissue, perivascularly, and in the intima of coronary arteries. in vitro activation of isolated hhmc induces the release of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators (histamine, tryptase, and cysteinyl leukotriene c(4) [ltc(4)]). we investigated the effects of several bacterial proteins on hhmc activation in vitro. hhmc released histamine, tryptase, and ltc(4) in response to staphylococcus aureus cowan 1 and the immunoglobulin (ig)-binding protein a, but not to s. aureus wood  46, which does not synthesize protein a. the effect of protein a was inhibited by preincubation with monoclonal igm v(h)3(+). some strains of peptostreptococcus magnus express an ig light chain-binding surface protein called protein l. such bacteria and soluble protein l stimulated the release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators from hhmc. preincubation of hhmc with either protein a or protein l resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus or anti-ige. monoclonal ige (kappa chains) blocked protein l-induced release, whereas ige (lambda chains) had no effect. streptococcal protein g, formyl-containing tripeptide, and pepstatin a did not activate hhmc. bacterial products protein a and protein l and intact bacteria (s. aureus and p. magnus) activate hhmc by acting as ig superantigens.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

AB  == background: a clinical study was undertaken to investigate and compare specifically the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected and noninfected leg ulcers. methods: leg ulcers, defined as being infected on the basis of clinical signs, were swab sampled and investigated for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms using stringent isolation and identification techniques. results:  two hundred and twenty isolates were cultured from 44 infected leg ulcers, in comparison with 110 isolates from 30 noninfected leg ulcers. statistical analysis indicated a significantly greater mean number of anaerobic bacteria per infected  ulcer (particularly peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp.) in comparison with the noninfected ulcer group (2.5 vs. 1.3, respectively) (p < 0.05). also, anaerobes represented 49% of the total microbial composition in infected leg ulcers compared with 36% in noninfected leg ulcers. the mean numbers of aerobes per wound in the two ulcer groups were not statistically different (p > 0.05). the study failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between commonly implicated facultative pathogens and wound infection. the isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low and, although staphylococcus aureus was a frequent isolate in both wound types, it was more prevalent in noninfected leg ulcers. conclusions: this study has demonstrated the complex aerobic-anaerobic microflora which exists in leg ulcers, the prevalence of anaerobes in infected wounds, and a poor correlation between the presence of specific aerobic pathogens and wound infection. in view of these findings, the role of microbial synergistic interactions in the pathogenesis of chronic wound infection may be of greater clinical importance than the isolated involvement of any specific potential pathogen.

TI  == [in vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of faropenem (frpm) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. frpm possessed potent in  vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria tested. frpm showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all gram-negative bacteria, but k. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. the mbc of frpm against s. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the mic of that, respectively. these results suggest that frpm has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == cervical necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience at a single institution.
AB  == objective: to evaluate clinical and microbiologic characteristics, modalities of  treatment and outcome of patients with cervical necrotizing fasciitis admitted to our institution. design: retrospective clinical investigation. patients and methods: we reviewed the charts of 20 consecutive patients hospitalized in our intensive care unit between january 1987 and june 1998 with the diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis. results: all the patients required mechanical ventilation. four of them had mediastinal involvement. the organisms most commonly implicated included streptococcus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species. patients with adequate surgery had a better outcome than those with inadequate surgical procedures. because no evidence-based recommendations exist in the field of head and neck infections, hyperbaric oxygen was not used as adjunctive therapy. of the 20 patients, 3 (15 %) died. conclusion: the main finding of this study is that prompt, rather than delayed, surgical debridement correlates with a decrease in morbidity and mortality. however, no definite conclusion is justified due to the relatively small number of patients. immediate radical debridement, and early redebridement if needed, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care support are critical in controlling these life-threatening infections.

TI  == coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common bacteria found in cultures from the deep portions of hidradenitis suppurativa lesions, as obtained by carbon dioxide laser surgery.
AB  == the significance of bacterial findings in hidradenitis suppurativa (hs) is controversial. interpretation of the results of bacteriological examinations from the surface of hs lesions is obscured by the possible contamination of resident skin bacteria. bacteriological analysis of aspirates from deeper parts of hs is liable to show low sensitivity. we used a carbon dioxide (co2) laser method to evaporate the diseased tissue level by level from the surface downwards, allowing concurrent sampling of bacteriological cultures from each level and thereby minimizing contamination with bacteria from the level above. in this study, 22 women and three men with a mean age of 35.3 years and a mean hs duration of 10.6  years were treated with this co2 laser surgical method. aerobic and anaerobic cultures from superficial and deep levels were taken during surgery. the regions  treated were axillary in eight and perineal in 17 cases. bacterial cultures were  positive for one or more specimens from at least one level in all cases and from  deep levels in all but three cases. sixteen different species or sub-species were found. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were the  species most frequently found. peptostreptococcus species and propionibacterium acnes were not uncommon. s. aureus was detected in a total of 14 cases, six of which were from the deep levels. s. aureus was the sole bacterium isolated in two deep cultures. cns were found in 21 patients and 16 of these isolates were from the deep levels. in nine of the 16 deep samples cns were the only bacteria detected. these findings motivate a re-evaluation of the significance of bacteria in the progress of hs and in particular they suggest that cns are true pathogens. it is known that foreign bodies aggravate the virulence of the cns in surgical implants, and an environment which resembles that produced by a foreign body, as  found in chronic hs tissue, serves to intensify the pathogenic properties of cns  in hs.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

(7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  == the goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. a total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. the malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and  candida spp. in 10 (1%). a total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), peptostreptococcus spp. (166), prevotella spp. (106), clostridium spp. (70), and fusobacterium spp. (43). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (133), staphylococcus aureus (100), klebsiella pneumoniae (48),  and pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). the type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds  and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). s. aureus and peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (prevotella and fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). this retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.

TI  == aerobic, anaerobic and fungal burn wound infections.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-seven patients were studied prospectively for aerobic, anaerobic and fungal burn wound infections. all cases yielded organisms on culture. a total of 377 isolates were recovered (239 aerobes, 116 anaerobes and 22 fungi). aerobic bacteria alone were present in 49 patients (38.6%). anaerobic  bacteria alone were present in four patients (3.2%). candida sp. alone was present in one patient (0.8%). mixed aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria and/or fungi were present in 73 patients (57.5%). fungi were isolated from 21 patients (23.9%) of 88 patients having fungal cultures. the predominant isolates recovered in descending order of frequency were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides sp., klebsiella sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. there were 70  patients (55.1%) infected with anaerobic bacteria. the rate of recovery of anaerobes was higher in patients with open wound dressing (72.7%) than in patients with occlusive wound dressings (41.7%), (p < 0.01). seventeen patients presented with septic shock, 15 of them (88.2%) yielding positive anaerobic cultures. bacteroides sp. were isolated from 14 patients with septic shock, and were recovered from the four patients who had anaerobic infection alone. these results indicate a significant role of bacteroides sp. in burn wound sepsis.

TI  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) are a heterogeneous group of organisms defined by their morphological appearance and their inability to grow in the presence of oxygen; most clinical isolates are identified to species in the genus peptostreptococcus. gpac are part of the normal flora of all mucocutaneous surfaces and are often isolated from infections such as deep organ abscesses, obstetric and gynecological sepsis, and intraoral infections. they have been little studied for several reasons, which include an inadequate classification, difficulties with laboratory identification, and the mixed nature of the infections from which they are usually isolated. nucleic acid studies indicate that the classification is in need of radical revision at the genus level. several species of peptostreptococcus have recently been described, but others still await formal recognition. identification has been based on carbohydrate fermentation tests, but most gpac are asaccharolytic and use the products of protein degradation for their metabolism; the introduction of commercially available preformed enzyme kits affords a physiologically more appropriate method of identification, which is simple and relatively rapid and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories. recent reports have documented the isolation in  pure culture of several species, notably peptostreptococcus magnus, from serious  infections. studies of p. magnus have elucidated several virulence factors which  correlate with the site of infection, and reveal some similarities to staphylococcus aureus. p. micros is a strongly proteolytic species; it is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in intraoral infections, particularly periodontitis, and mixed anaerobic deep-organ abscesses. comparison  of antibiotic susceptibility patterns reveals major differences between species.  penicillins are the antibiotics of choice, although some strains of p. anaerobius show broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == prospective study of bacteremia rate after elastic band ligation and sclerotherapy of esophageal varices in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.
AB  == background: esophageal band ligation is considered to be as efficient as endoscopic sclerotherapy, with a lower complication rate, including bacteremia. there are few studies comparing the two methods. the aim of this study was to compare the incidence of bacteremia after both treatments in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis. methods: endoscopic sclerotherapy and  band ligation were performed using standard techniques. blood samples were obtained 5 and 30 minutes after endoscopic band ligation or sclerotherapy and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. results: in the sclerotherapy group 2 of 43 (4.6%) blood cultures were positive (peptostreptococcus sp and streptococcus mitis). a similar result was obtained in the band ligation group: 2 of 35 (5.7%) had positive cultures, both with staphylococcus aureus. conclusions: there is no difference in the frequency of bacteremia after treatment of esophageal varices with endoscopic sclerotherapy or endoscopic band ligation in patients with portal hypertension secondary to schistosomiasis.

TI  == in-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  == one hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. all isolates, except rothia spp. (one), enterococcus avium (three), haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of prevotella, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides and porphyromonas. all the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. a potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the mics of  spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of eubacterium, two of  lactobacilli, one strain of peptostreptococcus sp. and one clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  == the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. as the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. problematic pathogens include strains of streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. other important pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups b, c, and g, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of listeria and corynebacterium and gram-positive anaerobes, such as peptostreptococcus and clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. the novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == microbiology of subperiosteal orbital abscess and associated maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == aspirate of pus from eight subperiosteal orbital abscesses (spoas) and their corresponding infected sinuses were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. polymicrobial flora was found in all instances, and the number of isolates varied from two to five. anaerobes were recovered from all specimens. the predominant isolates were peptostreptococcus spp, prevotella spp, fusobacterium spp, staphylococcus aureus, and microaerophilic streptococci. concordance in the microbiological findings between spoa and the infected sinus was found in all instances. however, certain organisms were only present at one site and not the other. fourteen beta-lactamase-producing organisms were present in nine specimens. these data confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis and demonstrate their predominance in the associated spoa.

TI  == isolation of non-sporing anaerobic rods from infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1994, 2033 microbiological specimens from children were submitted for cultures for anaerobic bacteria. fifty-seven isolates of bifidobacterium spp. were obtained from 55 (3%) children, 67 isolates of eubacterium spp. from 65 (3%) children and 41 isolates of lactobacillus spp. from 40 (2%) children. most bifidobacterium isolates were from chronic otitis media, abscesses, peritonitis,  aspiration pneumonia and paronychia. most eubacterium isolates were from abscesses, peritonitis, decubitus ulcers and bites. lactobacillus spp. were mainly isolated from abscesses, aspiration pneumonia, bacteraemia and conjunctivitis. most (> 90%) infections from which these species were isolated were polymicrobial and yielded a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the organisms most commonly isolated with the non-sporing anaerobic gram-positive rods were peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides spp., pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. most bacteroides spp. and e. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infection and skin and soft tissue infection around the rectal area, whereas most prevotella, porphyromonas and fusobacterium isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. the predisposing conditions associated with the isolation of non-sporing anaerobic gram-positive rods were previous surgery,  malignancy, steroid therapy and immunodeficiency. antimicrobial therapy was given to 149 (83%) of the 160 patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 89 (56%).

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. results: the predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were prevotella species, fusobacterium species, and peptostreptococcus species. four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (blpos) were  isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 blpos were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). the predominant  blpos in acute sinusitis were h influenzae, and m catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were staphylococcus aureus, prevotella species, fusobacterium species,  and bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained blpos. the detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of blpos in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against clinical isolates].
AB  == to examine the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients in 1994, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for cam and the control drugs. the results were as follows; 1. mic50 and mic90 of cam were similar to those investigated in 1980's against many bacterial species. 2. cam showed strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni and peptostreptococcus spp. 3. it appears that resistance to mls including cam is increasing among streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == macrolides resistance of common bacteria isolated from taiwan.
AB  == to determine the susceptibility to macrolides of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from taiwan, the in vitro activities of erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin were tested against 492 clinical  isolates of eight different bacteria, collected from the national taiwan university hospital. the results showed high minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) against most of the tested bacteria. the mic90s for staphylococcus aureus  (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains), streptococcus  pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, peptostreptococci, and bacteroides fragilis were all > or = 256 micrograms/ml. the mic50s for methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci,  and enterococci were > or = 256 micrograms/ml. for s. pneumoniae, peptostreptococci, and b. fragilis, the mic50s were > 8 micrograms/ml. the resistance rates to macrolides were 80% or more in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and about 30% in methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. around 55% of s. pneumoniae strains and 37 approximately 42% of s. pyogenes strains were resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance to different macrolides was clearly demonstrated in most of the resistant strains.

TI  == a risk-benefit assessment of teicoplanin in the treatment of infections.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic whose activity is selectively oriented against gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, clostridium difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and corynebacterium jeikeium; such activity is affected by neither methicillin resistance nor beta-lactamase production. teicoplanin is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; consequently, it has  to be administered intravenously (either by infusion or by rapid injection) or intramuscularly. its long half-life allows regimens based upon once daily administration. the adverse effects most frequently associated with teicoplanin treatment are local and hypersensitivity reactions, such as itching and drug fever; anaphylactoid reactions (the 'red man syndrome') are seldom observed. teicoplanin also has less potential than vancomycin to cause nephrotoxicity, especially when administered in combination with an aminoglycoside. teicoplanin has been proven to be effective in the treatment of microbiologically documented  gram-positive infections, including 'difficult to treat infections' such as endocarditis and prosthetic infections. furthermore, recent trials in patients with haematological malignancies or other cancers have clearly demonstrated that  teicoplanin is at least as efficacious as vancomycin in the empirical initial antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients, and is associated with fewer adverse effects. finally, owing to its good tolerability profile and the advantage of once daily administration by both intravenous and intramuscular routes, teicoplanin has proven to be very useful for the outpatient treatment of  serious gram-positive infections. in conclusion, teicoplanin is potentially an effective alternative to vancomycin both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with the advantage over vancomycin of single daily dose administration  and lower toxicity. further comparative studies with vancomycin are, however, required to better define the therapeutic role of teicoplanin for particular infections (i.e. infective endocarditis).

TI  == microbiology of gastrostomy site wound infections in children.
AB  == specimens of pus were obtained from gastrostomy site wound infections in 22 children. polymicrobial flora was found in 21 of the 22 wounds. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were isolated in eight (36%) instances and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora were isolated from the other 14 (64%) wounds. a total of  102 bacterial isolates (57 aerobic and 45 anaerobic) and seven cultures of candida were obtained. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli (16 isolates). peptostreptococcus spp. (14), enterococcus spp. (14), bacteroides spp. (12) and staphylococcus aureus (6). twenty-eight strains producing beta-lactamase were isolated from 16 (73%) patients. the presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, and the isolation of e. coli and bacteroides spp. were more frequent in wounds with gastric leakage than in wounds without gastric  leakage (p < 0.05). bacteria similar to those isolated from the wound were also isolated from blood cultures from three patients-two isolates of e. coli and one  each of b. fragilis and s. aureus. all patients received local therapy and 11 were treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of gastrostomy site wound infections, especially in association with gastric leakage, and the presence of beta-lactamase producers in most of these infections may have important implications for their management.

AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  == aims: the study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. methods: the normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined  preoperatively. swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) in 90%, propionibacterium acnes in 62%, corynebacterium sp in 18%, and peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. the lower fornices of 70% had cns, 47% p acnes, 6% staphylococcus aureus, 6% corynebacterium sp, and 6% candida. results: a sterile pmma intraocular lens was  touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. eighty two per cent of lenses grew cns, 18% p acnes, 18% bacillus sp, 12% s aureus, and  6% corynebacterium sp. a second sterile pmma intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. forty seven per cent of these cultured cns, 12% corynebacterium sp, and 6% bacillus sp. a high count of bacteria in the  operating field, especially cns and p acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. conclusion: special measures are needed before  and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma.
AB  == otitis media (om), a common infection in children, can cause significant morbidity. selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen directed against the pathogens responsible for the om can minimize complications. the most frequently isolated bacteria from chronic om are staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes are peptostreptococcus spp., pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp., bacteroides spp. and fusobacterium spp. many of the organisms causing om can produce beta-lactamase, which can contribute to the failure of penicillins therapy. the appropriate surgical and medical therapy for chronic om is reviewed.

TI  == distribution of clindamycin in cortical bone during direct local infusion of the  canine tibia.
AB  == the distribution of clindamycin in tibial cortical bone, administered via direct  local infusion with an implantable pump, is described. clindamycin concentrations in cortical bone were measured after 3, 7, and 21 days of intraosseous infusion.  the tibia were divided into four quadrants relative to the outflow infusion catheter site located in the medial aspect of the mid-diaphysis. a gradient of 5-30 mm from the infusion site was documented in all four quadrants (proximal lateral, proximal medial, distal lateral, and distal medial). at all sampling times, clindamycin concentrations in all quadrants exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations for gram-positive aerobic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis, and both the gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes, including peptostreptococcus species and bacteroides species. the data suggest that gravitational forces affect the diffusion of the clindamycin because concentrations in both distal quadrants were greater than in  corresponding proximal quadrants.

TI  == prophylactic antibiotic treatment in therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ercp:  results of a randomized controlled clinical study.
AB  == the present study evaluated the effects of prophylactic administration of cefotaxime in patients undergoing therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ercp. one hundred patients were randomized to two groups of 50 patients each. patients in group 1 received an intravenous infusion of 2 g cefotaxime 15 minutes before endoscopy; patients in group 2 did not receive an intravenous antibiotic before ercp (control group). blood samples were drawn for bacteriologic cultures before  endoscopy and 5, 15, 30, and 120 minutes after beginning the procedure. bacteremia was detected by blood cultures (15- and 30-minute samples) in 4 patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics (escherichia coli in 2 cases, peptostreptococcus in 1, and staphylococcus aureus in 1). cholangitis or sepsis did not occur after the bacteremic episodes in any of these patients. in 4 other patients who did not receive cefotaxime-all of whom had biliary obstruction-clinical cholangitis or sepsis developed during the 3-day follow-up;  ercp had failed to decompress the biliary system completely in these 4 cases. blood cultures identified bacteria in 3 of these 4 patients (pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, e. coli in 2). thus, bacteremia or clinical sepsis developed in  8/50 patients (16%) in the control group without antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas  no such episode was observed in patients who had received prophylactic treatment  (chi 2 = 8.7; p < 0.01). the present results indicate that prophylactic administration of an antibiotic such as cefotaxime can reduce the incidence of bacteremia and sepsis in patients who undergo therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ercp.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial endocarditis in patients with chronic liver disease.
AB  == objective: although patients with cirrhosis have an increased susceptibility for  bacterial infections, endocarditis complicating cirrhosis has been reported only  infrequently. in this study, our objective was to determine whether, bacterial endocarditis is, in fact, a complicating factor in cirrhosis. methods: we retrospectively studied all cases of bacterial endocarditis that occurred over the last 15 yr in patients with known cirrhosis. results: ten patients (three males, seven females) were identified, whose mean age was 55 yr (range 29-65 yr). bacterial organisms included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-positive (eight patients), peptostreptococcus (one patient), and enterococcus (one patient). underlying liver disease consisted of alcoholism (five patients), autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (two), cryptogenic cirrhosis (two), and primary biliary  cirrhosis (one). distribution of heart valves affected were mitral valve (six), aorta (two), and there were two involving both mitral and aortic valves. echocardiograms revealed vegetation in 50% of the patients. laboratory studies were markedly abnormal, with mean values of albumin 2.4 mg/dl, creatinine 2.5 mg/dl, bun 76.5 mg/dl, and total bilirubin 8.2 mg/dl. potential associated sources of infection were upper gastrointestinal bleeding (four), pneumonia (two), and one each of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hip replacement, heart  catheterization, and abdominal abscess. the outcome was poor, with death in eight of 10 patients. conclusions: bacterial endocarditis may complicate cirrhosis, may be more frequent in females, typically involves the mitral valve, and probably is due to staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

AB  == a series of 993 subgingival microbial samples sent to a diagnostic microbiology laboratory included 196 samples that could be identified as compatible with a clinical diagnosis of refractory or recurrent periodontitis. in descending order  of prevalence the associated microbiota included bacteroides forsythus (84%), spirochetes (83%), motile rods (76%), fusobacterium species (68%), porphyromonas  gingivalis (63%), campylobacter rectus (47%), capnocytophaga species (38%), prevotella intermedia (23%), peptostreptococcus micros (18%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (16%), candida (14%), enteric rods (9%), staphylococcus species, not including aureus (5.6%). eikenella corrodens (3%), staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and enterococcus species (< 1%). antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, penicillin g, or metronidazole was particularly noticeable for enteric rods, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, staphylococcus, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. it was largely absent for campylobacter rectus. no antibiotic sensitivity data were obtained for porphyromonas gingivalis or bacteroides forsythus, as these species were detected by immunofluorescence. the results indicate that a substantial number of microorganisms associated with  refractory periodontitis are variably resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. diagnostic microbiology must be considered an essential adjunct to the therapist  faced with periodontal lesions refractory to conventional treatment.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of external otitis.
AB  == microbiological and clinical data from 46 patients with external otitis were retrospectively evaluated. specimens were processed for isolation of aerobic and  anaerobic bacteria. a total of 42 aerobic bacteria, 22 anaerobic bacteria, and 3  candida albicans organisms were recovered. aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 31 patients (67%), anaerobic bacteria only were isolated from 8 (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 4 (9%). c. albicans alone was recovered from two patients (4%), and the organism was mixed with aerobic bacteria in one case (2%). the most common isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 instances), peptostreptococcus species (11), staphylococcus aureus (7), and bacteroides species (5). one isolate was recovered from 30 patients (65%), 2 isolates were recovered from 11 (24%), and 3 isolates were recovered from 5 (11%). beta-lactamase activity was detected in 32 isolates recovered from 27 specimens (59%). these data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of external otitis in one-third of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in one-quarter of them. further prospective studies are warranted for evaluating the role of anaerobic bacteria in this infection and the therapeutic implications of  these findings.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  == experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c in two different transport systems.
AB  == the survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c was evaluated. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart transport medium (mst), and a viscose swab in modified siff transport medium (btm) (bionor). the following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tetani, and actinomyces  israelii. additionally, a mixture of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was tested together with bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum and clostridium perfringens. both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the btm medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the mst in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%)  of the experiments (p < 0.05). there was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different b. fragilis strains. there was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees c compared to 22 degrees c, except for fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees c in the bionor transport system.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == diagnosis and management of parotitis.
AB  == of all the salivary glands, the parotid gland is most commonly affected by an inflammatory process. infections of the parotid gland range from acute to severe. assessment of the disease process should differentiate local primary parotid infection from systemic infection when this gland is also involved as part of a generalized inflammatory condition. viral parotitis can be caused by paramyxovirus (mumps), epstein-barr virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza a and parainfluenza viruses. acute suppurative parotitis is generally caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, and rarely, gram-negative bacteria. anaerobic bacteria, mostly peptostreptococcus species and bacteroides species, and pigmented porphyromonas species and prevotella species have been recently recognized as an important cause of this infection. beta-lactamase-producing organisms can be isolated in almost three fourths of the patients. predisposing factors to suppurative infections are dehydration, malnutrition, oral neoplasms,  immunosuppuration, sialolithiasis, and medications that diminish salivation. pus, aspirated from a suppurative parotic abscess, should be plated on media that are  supportive for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. early and proper antimicrobial therapy may prevent suppuration. initial empiric therapy that is directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may  be required until a specific causal diagnosis is available. surgical drainage may be indicated when pus has formed. this may prevent complications and facilitate recovery.

AB  == ninety-eight cases of empyema thoracis admitted to juntendo university hospital between 1979 and 1990 were reviewed. males accounted for 78 cases and females 20  cases. thirteen pediatric patients ranged in age from 17 days to 4 years, while the 85 adult cases ranged from 16 to 89 years (mean: 58.4 years). the mortality rate increased with age. fifty-three cases of community-acquired empyema thoracis consisted of 24 with no underlying disease (including 13 pediatric cases), and 29 with diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver damage or chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. forty-five nosocomial empyema cases occurred after chest operation or thoracocentesis, or due to a subdiaphragmatic pathogenic condition or congestive heart failure complicated with aspiration pneumonia. in this series, 63 patients (64.3%) had para- or post-pneumonic empyema. compared with the community-acquired infection cases, the mortality rate of the nosocomial infection cases was very high. seventy-eight cases were culture-positive, including 3 positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis. the remaining 20 cases were  culture-negative. in 75 cases of culture-positive pleural fluid, aerobic bacteria were isolated from 31 cases (mortality rate: 22.6%), anaerobes mixed with aerobes from 21 cases (mortality rate: 52.4%), and anaerobes only from 23 cases (mortality rate: 21.7%). thus, the mortality rate of mixed infected cases was highest. anaerobes were frequently isolated from the community-acquired empyema cases, and were often found in para- or postpneumonic lesions, including aspiration pneumonia. the most commonly encountered aerobe was staphylococcus aureus. among the anaerobes, bacteroides spp., microaerophilic streptococcus, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. were most common. a single organism was isolated in pure culture from 39 cases. single organisms isolated from fluids were more frequently aerobes (25) than anaerobes (14). the cases harboring bacteroides spp. showed the worst outcome, with 11 deaths in 25 such cases.

AB  == bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in sweden. streptococci, e.g. streptococcus dysgalactiae and str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being  isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. actinomyces  pyogenes, stuart-schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as peptostreptococcus indolicus, fusobacterium necrophorum and bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). when the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, may 15 to october 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). these figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of a. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. there were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. this and other swedish investigations support the theory that a. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. it is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of wounds and cutaneous abscesses.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of 584 wounds and 676 skin or soft-tissue abscesses were studied and correlated with the infection site. in wounds, aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 223 specimens (38%), anaerobes only in 177 specimens (30%), and mixed flora in 184 specimens (32%). in total there were 1470 isolates, 558 aerobic and 912 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per wound (1.6 anaerobic and 0.9 aerobic isolates). in abscesses, aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 177 specimens (26%), anaerobes only in 243 specimens (36%), and mixed flora in 256 specimens (38%). in total there were 1702 isolates, 602 aerobic and 1100 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per abscess. the highest rates of anaerobes in wounds were in the inguinal, buttocks, and trunk areas and in abscesses in the perirectal, external genitalia, neck, and inguinal areas. the predominant aerobic organisms were staphylococcus aureus (363 isolates), group a streptococci (98 isolates), and escherichia coli (97 isolates). the predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides species (986 isolates), peptostreptococcus species (559 isolates), clostridium species (153 isolates), and fusobacterium species (109 isolates). the predominance of certain isolates in certain anatomical sites  was correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. these data highlight the polymicrobial nature of wounds and cutaneous abscesses.

TI  == protein l. a bacterial ig-binding protein that activates human basophils and mast cells.
AB  == peptostreptococcus magnus strain 312 (10(6) to 10(8)/ml), which synthesizes a protein capable of binding to kappa l chains of human ig (protein l), stimulated  the release of histamine from human basophils in vitro. p. magnus strain 644, which does not synthesize protein l, did not induce histamine secretion. soluble  protein l (3 x 10(-2) to 3 micrograms/ml) induced histamine release from human basophils. the characteristics of the release reaction were similar to those of rabbit igg anti-fc fragment of human ige (anti-ige): it was ca2(+)- and temperature-dependent, optimal release occurring at 37 degrees c in the presence  of 1.0 mm extracellular ca2+. there was an excellent correlation (r = 0.82; p less than 0.001) between the maximal percent histamine release induced by protein l and that induced by anti-ige, as well as between protein l and protein a from staphylococcus aureus (r = 0.52; p less than 0.01). preincubation of basophils with either protein l or anti-ige resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus. ige purified from myeloma patients ps and pp (lambda-chains) blocked anti-ige-induced histamine release but failed to block the histamine releasing activity of protein l. in contrast, ige purified from myeloma patient adz (kappa-chains) blocked both anti-ige- and protein l-induced releases, whereas human polyclonal igg selectively blocked protein l-induced secretion. protein l acted as a complete secretagogue, i.e., it activated basophils to release sulfidopeptide leukotriene c4 as well as histamine. protein l (10(-1) to 3 micrograms/ml) also induced the release of preformed (histamine) and de novo synthesized mediators (leukotriene c4 and/or pgd2) from mast cells isolated from lung parenchyma and skin tissues. intradermal injections of protein l (0.01 to 10 micrograms/ml) in nonallergic subjects caused a dose-dependent wheal-and-flare reaction. protein l activates human basophils and mast cells in vitro and in vivo presumably by interacting with kappa l chains of the ige isotype.

TI  == use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (mnt) broth by various gram-positive cocci. the mnt broth consists of 0.5% trypticase (bbl microbiology  systems, cockeysville, md.), 0.5% yeast extract (difco laboratories, detroit, mich.), 0.2% l-norleucine, and 0.1% l-tyrosine. the microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. magnus, and p. prevotii), staphylococcus spp. (s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saccharolyticus), and streptococcus spp. (s. agalactiae, s. intermedius, s. mutans, s. sanguis i, and s. sanguis ii). only peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in mnt broth cultures. all 11 p. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in mnt broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. this unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of p. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.

TI  == microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  == specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). a total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes  and 153 aerobes) were recovered. an average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. however, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group a streptococcus (9 isolates), and escherichia coli (7 isolates). the predominant anaerobic organisms were peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 bacteroides fragilis groups). the  study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  == it is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans. a quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 x 10(6) cfu/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). the strain of f. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). p. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. it is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus  pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == to compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and  lower extremities caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. the mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. a successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the  patients. no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. the incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. a once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.

TI  == microbiological and clinical aspects of aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == aspiration pneumonia is characterized by a pneumonitis in a dependent segment of  the lung with typical necrosis or abscess-formation in the parenchyma. observed aspiration or predisposition to aspiration, cavitation or abscess formation, with or without empyema fluid and isolation of distinctive micro-organisms are important clues to the diagnosis. diagnostic procedures to collect anaerobic uncontaminated secretions are transtracheal aspiration, blood cultures, pleural fluid aspiration, fibreoptic bronchoscopic protected investigations and percutaneous transthoracic aspiration. leading pathogens in more than 90% are anaerobic bacteria, mostly species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus and peptostreptococcus; aerobic bacteria include staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli, mainly klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. treatment depends on bacteriological results; penicillin g and clindamycin are the most useful antibiotics against anaerobes and should be administered over a long period of time (4-12 weeks), adjusted to the clinical course of the individual patient.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  == cultures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the inferior nasal  meatus of 25 children with purulent nasopharyngitis and from 25 controls. microorganisms were isolated from all specimens. a total of 98 isolates (3.9 per  patient), 45 aerobes (1.8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2.1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent nasopharyngitis. seventy-three isolates (2.9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1.9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1.0 per patient) were found in the controls. the organisms recovered in statistically significantly higher numbers in patients with nasopharyngitis were streptococcus  pneumoniae, haemophilus sp., peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and bacteroides spp. the organisms recovered in significantly higher numbers in controls were staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes. beta-lactamase activity was detected in 19 isolates recovered from 15 individuals (9 patients and 6 controls). these findings demonstrate the aerobic-anaerobic polymicrobial flora associated with purulent nasopharyngitis. further studies are indicated to  evaluate the pathogenic role of these organisms in this condition.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  == flurithromycin is an (8,s)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of streptomyces erythraeus atcc 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. the range of mic for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group a is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline ph. among anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, other species of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. flurithromycin also showed some  activity on mycobacterium bovis, m. scrofulaceum and m. phley. the determination  of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 x mic. a combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. the possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. at concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed  in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. on combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. the combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. in combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. using this combination, secondary resistance of pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. when ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.

TI  == the fermentation of lactulose by colonic bacteria.
AB  == sixty-four strains of intestinal bacteria were cultured under anaerobic conditions in lactulose-containing media to assess their ability to ferment lactulose. some organisms were unable to metabolize the disaccharide, while others, e.g. clostridia and lactobacilli, metabolized lactulose extensively. quantitative analyses of the fermentation products indicated that the major non-gaseous metabolites were acetic, lactic and butyric acids. hydrogen and carbon dioxide were the only gases detected. fermentation products were estimated for selected species throughout their growth cycles. the products of fermentation of lactulose by stool cultures varied with incubation conditions such as ph, but  correlated well with those produced by pure cultures. these results are discussed in relation to the therapeutic uses of lactulose.

TI  == extensive botryomycosis in a patient with diabetes and chronic active hepatitis.
AB  == extensive botryomycosis was diagnosed in a patient with diabetes mellitus with chronic active hepatitis. peptostreptococcus organisms and staphylococcus aureus  grew from the sulfur granule cultures. the patient's neutrophils showed notable inhibition of chemotaxis toward endotoxin-activated normal serum. the patient's serum also had an inhibitor to neutrophil chemotaxis, this inhibiting substance was probably antistreptolysin o. results of other tests of neutrophil function and skin tests to evaluate cell-mediated immunity were normal.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == bacterial interference between clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. it is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by c. difficile. the inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against c. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of c. difficile, with lactobacillus organisms and group d enterococci displaying  the most antagonistic activity. c. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. all eight strains of c. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera bacteroides, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus.

TI  == microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in zaria, nigeria.
AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  == forty-two children with decubitus ulcers were studied using aerobic and anaerobic techniques. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 (50%) of the patients, five times as the only isolates and 16 times mixed with aerobes. aerobes only were present in 20 (48%) of the patients. there were a total of 83 isolates, 46 aerobes and 37 anaerobes, with an average of two species per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.9 anaerobes). the predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci (17), bacteroides fragilis (6), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4). the most common aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus (23), group a beta hemolytic streptococci (6), hemophilus influenzae (5), and enterobacter agglomerans (5). the polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children is demonstrated.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cervical adenitis in children.
AB  == needle aspirates from 53 inflamed cervical lymph glands were studies for aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. bacterial growth was achieved in 45 patients (85%). sixty-six bacterial isolates were recovered, averaging 1.5 isolates per specimen (0.8 aerobes and 0.7 anaerobes), with as many as 4 isolates in some specimens. aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 27 aspirates (60%) of the 45 culture-positive aspirates, anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 specimens (20%). mycobacterium scrofulaceum was recovered in one (2%). the predominant aerobic organisms were staphylococcus aureus (14 isolates) and group a beta hemolytic streptococci (8).  a total of 31 anaerobes were recovered, including gram-positive cocci (9, including 6 peptococcus sp. and 3 peptostreptococcus sp.), 8 bacteroides sp. (including 3 b. melaninogenicus), 5 propionibacterium acnes, and 4 fusobacterium  nucleatum. these data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == pediatric infectious cervical lymphadenitis.
AB  == infectious cervical lymphadenitis is a frequently encountered problem in the pediatric population. the recent experience with infectious cervical lymphadenitis at the children's hospital of philadelphia was reviewed. the most common etiologic agent was staphylococcus aureus. beta-hemolytic streptococcus and mycobacterium were found in 15% and 6% of cases respectively. other agents included pneumococcus, cat scratch, toxoplasma gondii, actinomycosis, and mixed bacteroides and peptostreptococcus. most patients responded to high-dose intravenous antistaphylococcal penicillin. needle aspiration proved successful in identifying the casual agent in a high percentage of cases. aspiration was also beneficial in draining small abscess cavities. surgical drainage was rarely necessary.

TI  == antigenic relationships and rapid identification of peptostreptococcus species.
AB  == antisera against whole cells of each peptostreptococcus species (p. anaerobius, p. micros, p. parvulus, and p. productus) were produced in rabbits. when these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in ouchterlony tests, lines of identity were obtained among the antigens from all the species and uninoculated culture medium. when the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. these absorbed antisera, specific for each peptostreptococcus species by ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein a was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. these reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. no cross-reactions occurred with the streptococcus intermedius, peptococcus magnus,  or peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of acute conjunctivitis.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures and clinical data were obtained from 131 patients  presenting with acute conjunctivitis. similar cultures were obtained from 60 noninflamed individuals. anaerobes were isolated from 66 patients, 51 times in mixed culture with aerobes and 15 times (11.5%) as the only isolates. aerobes only were recovered in 54 patients. the organisms found to be statistically significantly more commonly recovered from eyes with conjunctivitis were staphylococcus aureus, hemophilus influenzae, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes. no statistical difference was present between the bacterial flora of the eyes with unilateral conjunctivitis when compared to their uninvolved mates in 20 cases in which only one eye was involved.

TI  == acute suppurative parotitis caused by anaerobic bacteria: report of two cases.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen in acute suppurative parotitis. although anaerobic bacteria are prevalent in the normal oral and upper respiratory tract flora and frequently are involved in oral and facial infections, they have seldom been isolated from patients with suppurative parotitis. it may be that a role for anaerobes in parotitis has not been documented because of inadequate specimen transport or anaerobic culture techniques. we describe two cases of acute suppurative parotitis in which cultures yielded anaerobic bacteria. in one case, no aerobes were isolated; in the other, the anaerobe was the predominant organism numerically.

TI  == bacteriology of necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  == bacteriology of normal and infected conjunctiva.
AB  == the conjunctivas of 273 inflamed eyes were cultured by both aerobic and anaerobic techniques. isolations were obtained from 267 (97.8%) of the eyes. aerobic organisms were isolated from 237 (86.8%) of the conjunctivas. staphylococcus aureus from 63 (23.1%) of the diseased eyes was the aerobic pathogen most often isolated. anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 172 (63.0%) of the conjunctivas.  propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 126 (46.2%) of the conjunctivas, and peptostreptococcus species were isolated from 80 (29.3%) of the conjunctivas. comparison with the bacteriology of 96 normal eyes showed that anaerobes play a much greater role as etiological agents of conjunctivitis than formerly believed. when anaerobic bacteria were isolated, they appeared on the average in 7 days, indicating that they may be missed by ordinary bacteriological culturing.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.

AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
