TI  - Bacterial pectate lyases, structural and functional diversity.
AB  - Pectate lyases are enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation. They cleave pectin using a beta-elimination mechanism, specific for acidic polysaccharides. They are mainly produced by plant pathogens and plant-associated organisms, and only rarely by animals. Pectate lyases are also commonly produced in the bacterial world, either by bacteria living in close proximity with plants or by gut bacteria that find plant material in the digestive tract of their hosts. The role of pectate lyases is essential for plant pathogens, such as Dickeya dadantii, that use a set of pectate lyases as their main virulence factor. Symbiotic bacteria produce their own pectate lyases, but they also induce plant pectate lyases to initiate the symbiosis. Pectin degradation products may act as signals affecting the plant-bacteria interactions. Bacterial pectate lyases are also essential for using the pectin of dead or living plants as a carbon source for growth. In the animal gut, Bacteroides pectate lyases degrade the pectin of ingested food, and this is particularly important for herbivores that depend on their microflora for the digestion of pectin. Some human pathogens, such as Yersinia enterocolitica, produce a few intracellular pectate lyases that can facilitate their growth in the presence of highly pectinolytic bacteria, at the plant surface, in the soil or in the animal gut.
