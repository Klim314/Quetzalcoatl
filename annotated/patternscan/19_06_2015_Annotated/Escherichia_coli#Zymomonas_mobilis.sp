TI  == [production of coenzyme q10 by metabolically engineered escherichia coli].
AB  == coenzyme q10 (coq10) is a lipophilic antioxidant that improves human immunity, delays senility and enhances the vitality of the human body and has wide applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. microbial fermentation is a sustainable way to produce coq10, and attracts increased interest. in this work, the native coq8 synthetic pathway of escherichia coli was replaced by the coq10 synthetic pathway through integrating decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene  (dps) from rhodobacter sphaeroides into chromosome of e. coli atcc 8739, followed by deletion of the native octaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ispb). the resulting strain gd-14 produced 0.68 mg/l coq10 with a yield of 0.54 mg/g dcw. modulation of dxs and idi genes of the mep pathway and ubica genes in combination led to 2.46-fold increase of coq10 production (from 0.54 to 1.87 mg/g dcw). recruiting glucose facilitator protein of zymomonas mobilis to replace the native phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (pts) further led to a 16% increase of coq10 yield. finally, fed-batch fermentation of the best strain gd-51 was performed, which produced 433 mg/l coq10 with a yield of 11.7 mg/g dcw. to the best of our knowledge, this was the highest coq10 titer and yield obtained for engineered e. coli.

TI  == synthetic sugar cassettes for the efficient production of flavonol glycosides in  escherichia coli.
AB  == background: a multi-monocistronic synthetic vector was used to assemble multiple  genes of a nucleotide diphosphate (ndp)-sugar biosynthetic pathway to construct robust genetic circuits for the production of valuable flavonoid glycosides in escherichia coli. characterized functional genes involved in the biosynthesis of  uridine diphosphate (udp)-glucose and thymidine diphosphate (tdp)-rhamnose from various microbial sources along with glucose facilitator diffusion protein (glf)  and glucokinase (glk) from zymomonas mobilis were assembled and overexpressed in  a single synthetic multi-monocistronic operon. results: the newly generated ndp-sugars biosynthesis circuits along with regiospecific glycosyltransferases from plants were introduced in e. coli bl21 (de3) to probe the bioconversion of fisetin, a medicinally important polyphenol produced by various plants. as a result, approximately 1.178 g of fisetin 3-o-glucoside and 1.026 g of fisetin 3-o-rhamnoside were produced in udp-glucose and tdp-rhamnose biosynthesis systems respectively, after 48 h of incubation in 3 l fermentor while supplementing 0.9 g of fisetin. these yields of fisetin glycosides represent ~99% of bioconversion of exogenously supplemented fisetin. the systems were also found to be highly effective in bio-transforming other flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin)  into their respective glycosides, achieving over 95% substrate conversion. conclusion: the construction of a synthetic expression vector for bacterial cell  factory followed by subsequent re-direction of metabolic flux towards desirable products have always been revolutionized the biotechnological processes and technologies. this multi-monocistronic synthetic vector in a microbial platform is customizable to defined task and would certainly be useful for applications in producing and modifying such therapeutically valued plant secondary metabolites.

TI  == rational design of a synthetic entner-doudoroff pathway for improved and controllable nadph regeneration.
AB  == nadph is an essential cofactor for the biosynthesis of several high-value chemicals, including isoprenoids, fatty acid-based fuels, and biopolymers. tunable control over all potentially rate-limiting steps, including the nadph regeneration rate, is crucial to maximizing production titers. we have rationally engineered a synthetic version of the entner-doudoroff pathway from zymomonas mobilis that increased the nadph regeneration rate in escherichia coli mg1655 by  25-fold. to do this, we combined systematic design rules, biophysical models, and computational optimization to design synthetic bacterial operons expressing the 5-enzyme pathway, while eliminating undesired genetic elements for maximum expression control. nadph regeneration rates from genome-integrated pathways were estimated using a nadph-binding fluorescent reporter and by the productivity of a nadph-dependent terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. we designed and constructed improved pathway variants by employing the rbs library calculator to efficiently  search the 5-dimensional enzyme expression space and by performing 40 cycles of mage for site-directed genome mutagenesis. 624 pathway variants were screened using a nadph-dependent blue fluorescent protein, and 22 were further characterized to determine the relationship between enzyme expression levels and  nadph regeneration rates. the best variant exhibited 25-fold higher normalized mbfp levels when compared to wild-type strain. combining the synthetic entner-doudoroff pathway with an optimized terpenoid pathway further increased the terpenoid titer by 97%.

TI  == [transformation of phosphotransferase system in escherichia coli].
AB  == we constructed several recombinant escherichia coli strains to transform phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts system) and compared the characteristics of growth and metabolism of the mutants. we knocked-out the key genes ptsi and ptsg in pts system by using red homologous recombination in e. coli and meanwhile we also knocked-in the glucose facilitator gene glf from zymomonas mobilis in the e. coli chromosome. recombinant e. coli strains were constructed and the effects of cell growth, glucose consumption and  acetic acid accumulation were also evaluated in all recombinant strains. the deletion of gene ptsg and ptsi inactivated some pts system functions and inhibited the growth ability of the cell. expressing the gene glf can help recombinant e. coli strains re-absorb the glucose through glf-glk (glucose facilitator-glucokinase) pathway as it can use atp to phosphorylate glucose and transport into cell. this pathway can improve the availability of glucose and also reduce the accumulation of acetic acid; it can also broaden the carbon flux  in the metabolism pathway.

TI  == construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in escherichia coli and its application in allitol production.
AB  == an engineered strain for the conversion of d-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in escherichia coli. d-psicose-3-epimerase from ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. the cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from candida methylica for continuous nadh supply. the recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mm d-fructose. to increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate,  the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. the results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system; the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mm d-fructose was used as the substrate.

TI  == fusion of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase increases ethanol production in escherichia coli.
AB  == ethanol is an important biofuel. heterologous expression of zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhb) increases ethanol production in escherichia coli. a fusion of pdc and adh was generated and expressed in e. coli. the fusion enzyme was demonstrated to possess both activities. adhb activity was significantly lower when fused to pdc than when the two enzymes were expressed separately. however, cells expressing the fusion protein generated ethanol more rapidly and to higher levels than cells coexpressing pdc and adhb, suggesting a specific rate enhancement due to the fusion of the two enzymes.

TI  == pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase overexpression in escherichia coli resulted in high ethanol production and rewired metabolic enzyme networks.
AB  == pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase are efficient enzymes for ethanol production in zymomonas mobilis. these two enzymes were over-expressed in escherichia coli, a promising candidate for industrial ethanol production, resulting in high ethanol production in the engineered e. coli. to investigate the intracellular changes to the enzyme overexpression for homoethanol production, 2-de and lc-ms/ms were performed. more than 1,000 protein spots were  reproducibly detected in the gel by image analysis. compared to the wild-type, 99 protein spots showed significant changes in abundance in the recombinant e. coli, in which 46 were down-regulated and 53 were up-regulated. most proteins related to tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycerol metabolism and other energy metabolism were up-regulated, whereas proteins involved in glycolysis and glyoxylate pathway were down-regulated, indicating the rewired metabolism in the engineered e. coli. as glycolysis is the main pathway for ethanol production, and it was inhibited significantly in engineered e. coli, further efforts should be directed at minimizing the repression of glycolysis to optimize metabolism network for higher yields of ethanol production.

TI  == autotransporter mediated esterase display on zymomonas mobilis and zymobacter palmae.
AB  == autodisplay, i.e. surface expression of recombinant proteins by virtue of the autotransporter secretion pathway, has been used predominantly with escherichia coli as host organism, which often limits the applicability of this technique to  laboratory purposes and scales. the aim of this study was to investigate if the fermentative bacteria zymomonas mobilis and zymobacter palmae, representing attractive candidates for industrial applications, can serve as host organisms for autodisplay. we therefore used the carboxylesterase esta from burkholderia gladioli as an autotransporter passenger to display it on the surfaces of z. palmae and z. mobilis. expression and outer membrane localization of the esta-autotransporter fusion protein were verified by sds-page, and surface display of the enzyme was demonstrated by elisa and flow cytometer analysis. whole-cell activity assays revealed that esta retained its activity on the cell surface. recombinant z. palmae cells exhibited significant higher esterase activity (294mu/ml/od 1) in comparison to z. mobilis (88mu/ml/od 1) and the control e. coli (113mu/ml/od 1). this appears even more noteworthy, as about 30%  of esta was released from the cell surface of z. palmae. nevertheless, our results indicate that both species are suitable autodisplay hosts, in particular  z. palmae for displaying esterase, opening up new horizons for biocatalytic applications.

TI  == extracellular secretion of beta-glucosidase in ethanologenic e. coli enhances ethanol fermentation of cellobiose.
AB  == consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose for ethanol production is realized by expressing cellulase enzymes on ethanologenic strain. in this study, an ethanologenic escherichia coli zy81 was constructed by integrating pyruvate decarboxylase gene pdc and alcohol dehydrogenase gene adhb from zymomonas mobilis into the genome of e. coli jm109 to obtain the capability of ethanol production.  then, the beta-glucosidase gene bglb from bacillus polymyxa was cloned and secretively expressed in e. coli zy81. the recombinant strain e. coli zy81/bglb showed an obvious activity of beta-glucosidase in extracellular location with more than half in periplasmic space. edta was found to promote the release of the periplasmic proteins by approximately tenfold. e. coli zy81/bglb utilized cellobiose as sole carbon source for ethanol production with 33.99 % of theoretical yield.

TI  == zymomonas mobilis: a novel platform for future biorefineries.
AB  == biosynthesis of liquid fuels and biomass-based building block chemicals from microorganisms have been regarded as a competitive alternative route to traditional. zymomonas mobilis possesses a number of desirable characteristics for its special entner-doudoroff pathway, which makes it an ideal platform for both metabolic engineering and commercial-scale production of desirable bio-products as the same as escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae based on consideration of future biomass biorefinery. z. mobilis has been studied extensively on both fundamental and applied level, which will provide a basis for industrial biotechnology in the future. furthermore, metabolic engineering of z.  mobilis for enhancing bio-ethanol production from biomass resources has been significantly promoted by different methods (i.e. mutagenesis, adaptive laboratory evolution, specific gene knock-out, and metabolic engineering). in addition, the feasibility of representative metabolites, i.e. sorbitol, bionic acid, levan, succinic acid, isobutanol, and isobutanol produced by z. mobilis and the strategies for strain improvements are also discussed or highlighted in this  paper. moreover, this review will present some guidelines for future developments in the bio-based chemical production using z. mobilis as a novel industrial platform for future biofineries.

TI  == studying the rapid bioconversion of lignocellulosic sugars into ethanol using high cell density fermentations with cell recycle.
AB  == background: the rapid bioconversion with integrated recycle technology (rabit) process reduces capital costs, processing times, and biocatalyst cost for biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels by reducing total bioprocessing time (enzymatic hydrolysis plus fermentation) to 48 h, increasing biofuel productivity (g/l/h) twofold, and recycling biocatalysts (enzymes and microbes) to the next cycle. to achieve these results, rabit utilizes 24-h high cell density fermentations along with cell recycling to solve the slow/incomplete xylose fermentation issue, which is critical for lignocellulosic biofuel fermentations. previous studies utilizing similar fermentation conditions showed  a decrease in xylose consumption when recycling cells into the next fermentation  cycle. eliminating this decrease is critical for rabit process effectiveness for  high cycle counts. results: nine different engineered microbial strains (including saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, scheffersomyces (pichia) stipitis strains, zymomonas mobilis 8b, and escherichia coli ko11) were tested under rabit platform fermentations to determine their suitability for this platform. fermentation conditions were then optimized for s. cerevisiae glbrcy128. three different nutrient sources (corn steep liquor, yeast extract, and wheat germ) were evaluated to improve xylose consumption by recycled cells. capacitance readings were used to accurately measure viable cell mass profiles over five cycles. conclusion: the results showed that not all strains are capable of effectively performing the rabit process. acceptable performance is largely correlated to the specific xylose consumption rate. corn steep liquor was found to reduce the deleterious impacts of cell recycle and improve specific xylose consumption rates. the viable cell mass profiles indicated that reduction in specific xylose consumption rate, not a drop in viable cell mass, was the main cause for decreasing xylose consumption.

TI  == expression of a xylose-specific transporter improves ethanol production by metabolically engineered zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == zymomonas mobilis is a promising organism for biofuel production as it can produce ethanol from glucose at high rates. however, z. mobilis does not natively ferment c5 sugars such as xylose. while it has been engineered to do so, the engineered strains do not metabolize these sugars at high rates. previous research has identified some of the bottlenecks associated with xylose metabolism in z. mobilis. in this work, we investigated transport as a possible bottleneck.  in particular, we hypothesized that the slow uptake of xylose through the promiscuous glf transporter may limit the efficiency of xylose metabolism in z. mobilis. to test this hypothesis, we expressed xyle, the low-affinity xylose transporter from escherichia coli, in a xylose-utilizing strain of z. mobilis. our results show that the expression of this pentose-specific transporter improves the rate of xylose utilization in z. mobilis; however, this enhancement  is seen only at high xylose concentrations. in addition, we also found that overexpression of the promiscuous z. mobilis transporter glf yielded similar results, suggesting that the transport bottleneck is not due to the specificity,  but rather the capacity for sugar uptake.

TI  == pzmo7-derived shuttle vectors for heterologous protein expression and proteomic applications in the ethanol-producing bacterium zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == background: the ethanol-producing bacterium zymomonas mobilis has attracted considerable scientific and commercial interest due to its exceptional physiological properties. shuttle vectors derived from native plasmids have previously been successfully used for heterologous gene expression in this bacterium for a variety of purposes, most notably for metabolic engineering applications. results: a quantitative pcr (qpcr) approach was used to determine the copy numbers of two endogenous double stranded dna plasmids: pzmo1a (1,647 bp) and pzmo7 (pza1003; 4,551 bp) within the ncimb 11163 strain of z. mobilis. data indicated pzmo1a and pzmo7 were present at ca. 3-5 and ca. 1-2 copies per cell, respectively. a ca. 1,900 bp fragment from plasmid pzmo7 was used to construct two escherichia coli - z. mobilis shuttle vectors (pz7c and pz7-184). the intracellular stabilities and copy numbers of pz7c and pz7-184 were characterized within the ncimb 11163, atcc 29191 and (atcc 10988-derived) cu1 rif2 strains of z. mobilis. both shuttle vectors could be stably maintained within the atcc 29191 strain (ca. 20-40 copies per cell), and the cu1 rif2 strain (ca. 2-3 copies per cell), for more than 50 generations in the absence of an antibiotic selectable marker. a selectable marker was required for shuttle vector maintenance in the parental ncimb 11163 strain; most probably due to competition  for replication with the endogenous pzmo7 plasmid molecules. n-terminal glutathione s-transferase (gst)-fusions of four endogenous proteins, namely the acyl-carrier protein (acpp); 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphooctonate aldolase (kdsa); dna polymerase iii chi subunit (holc); and the rna chaperone protein hfq; were successfully expressed from pz7c-derived shuttle vectors, and their protein-protein binding interactions were analyzed in z. mobilis atcc 29191. using this approach, proteins that co-purified with acpp and kdsa were identified. conclusions: we show that a shuttle vector-based protein affinity 'pull-down' approach can be used to probe protein interaction networks in z. mobilis cells. our results demonstrate that protein expression plasmids derived from pzmo7 have significant potential for use in future biological or biotechnological applications within z. mobilis.

TI  == on the role of the appended p19 element in type a rnas of bacterial rnase p.
AB  == comparative in silico analyses of bacterial rnase p enzymes clustered their rna subunits in type a rna, found in escherichia coli, and in type b, found in bacillus subtilis. zymomonas mobilis rnase p consists of one protein (zmo-rnpa) and one type a rna (rpr) subunit containing the p19 element, present in many rnase p rnas of any structure class but lacking in the e. coli rnase p rna. to investigate the putative role of the p19 stem, we constructed a p19 deletion rna  mutant (deltap19rpr) and performed detailed kinetic analysis of reconstituted enzymes in the presence of the homologous zmo-rnpa protein or eco-rnpa protein from e. coli. the deletion of p19 perturbs the monovalent ion requirements. the mg(2+) requirement for the deltap19rpr holoenzyme was almost identical to that for the wtrpr holoenzyme at mg(2+) concentrations of </=25 mm. interestingly, enzymes reconstituted with eco-rnpa protein, relative to those assembled with zmo-rnpa, exhibited enhanced activity in the presence of deltap19rpr, suggesting  that eco-rnpa protein can effectively replace its z. mobilis counterpart. homologous and heterologous reconstituted enzymes in the presence of deltap19rpr  exhibited differences in their km values and catalytic efficacies. overall, the presence of the p19 stem points toward an adaption during the co-evolution of zmo-rnpa and rpr that is essential for stabilizing the overall structure of the z. mobilis rnase p. finally, our results are in line with existing structural data on rnase p enzymes and provide biochemical support for the possible role of  appended domains in rnase p rna subunits.

TI  == robustness of pseudomonas putida kt2440 as a host for ethanol biosynthesis.
AB  == expansion of the burgeoning biofuels agenda involves not only the design of suitable genetic and metabolic devices but also their deployment into suitable hosts that can endure the stress brought about by the products themselves. the microorganisms that are easiest to genetically manipulate for these endeavors (e.g. escherichia coli) are often afflicted by an undesirable sensitivity to the  very product that they are engineered to synthesize. in this context, we have examined the resistance to the stress arising from ethanol synthesis and/or its addition to cultures of recombinant pseudomonas putida, using as a benchmark the  same trait in an e. coli strain. to this end, ethanologenic strains of these two  species were constructed by functionally expressing pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase)  and adhb (alcohol dehydrogenase) from zymomonas mobilis. recombinants were compared under anoxic conditions as ethanol producers, and cell survival, stress  resistance, and phenotypic stability were quantified in each case. p. putida consistently outperformed e. coli in every ethanol tolerance test conducted - whether the alcohol was produced endogenously or added exogenously. these results highlight the value of this bacterium as a microbial cell factory for the production of biofuels owing to its naturally pre-evolved ability to withstand different kinds of chemical stresses.

TI  == [construction of an ethanologenic escherichia coli strain expressing beta-glucosidase].
AB  == constructing ethanologenic strains with cellulose activity is important to achieve consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose for ethanol production. in this study, we integrated the pyruvate decarboxylase gene pdc and alcohol dehydrogenase gene adhb from zymomonas mobilis zm4 into escherichia coli jm109 by red recombination method to generatea recombinant strain e. coli p81 that could produce ethanol from glucose. abeta-glucosidase gene bglb from bacillus polymyxa  1.794 was cloned into the recombinant e. coli p81 and beta-glucosidase was expressed to give a new recombinant strain e. coli p81 (puc19-bglb) with dual functions of cellobiose degradation and ethanol production. the extracellular beta-glucosidaseactivity was 84.78 mu/ml broth and the extracellular cellobiase activity of e. coli p81 (puc19-bglb) was 32.32 mu/ml broth. e. coli p81 (puc19-bglb) fermented cellobiose to ethanol with a yield of 55.8% of the theoretical value, and when glucose and cellobiose were co-fermented, the ethanol yield reached 46.5% of thetheoretical value. the construction of consolidated bioprocessing strain opens the possibility to convert cellobiose to ethanol in a  single bioprocess.

TI  == [recombinant expression, purification and characterization of a novel dyp-type peroxidase in escherichia coli].
AB  == dye-decolorizing peroxidase (dyp-type peroxidase) represents a group of heme-containing peroxidases able to decolour various organic dyes, most of which  are xenobiotics. to identify and characterize a new dyp-type peroxidase (zmdyp) from zymomonas mobilis zm4 (atcc 31821), zmdyp was amplified from the genomic dna of z. mobilis by pcr, and cloned into the escherichia coli expression vector pet-21b(+). alignment of the amino acid sequence of zmdyp with other members of the dyp-type peroxidases revealed the presence of the active site conserved residues d149, r239, t254, f256 as well as the typical gxxdg motif, indicating that zmdyp is a new member of the dyp-type peroxidase family. pet-21b(+) containing zmdyp gene was expressed in e. coli by iptg induction. the expressed enzyme was purified by ni-chelating chromatography. sds-page analysis of the purified enzyme revealed a molecular weight of 36 kda, whereas activity staining  gave a molecular weight of 108 kda, suggesting that the enzyme could be a trimer. in addition, zmdyp is a heme-containing enzyme as shown by a typical heme absorption peak of soret band. moreover, zmdyp showed high catalytic efficiency with 2, 2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) as a substrate. these results enrich the pool of dyp-type peroxidases and lay a foundation for further  studies.

TI  == systematic approach to engineer escherichia coli pathways for co-utilization of a glucose-xylose mixture.
AB  == glucose and xylose are two major sugars of lignocellulosic hydrolysate. the regulatory program of catabolite repression in escherichia coli dictates the preferred utilization of glucose over xylose, which handicaps the development of  the lignocellulose-based fermentation process. to co-utilize a glucose-xylose mixture, the e. coli strain was manipulated by pathway engineering in a systematic way. the approach included (1) blocking catabolite repression, (2) enhancing glucose transport, (3) increasing the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, and (4) eliminating undesirable pathways. moreover, the ethanol synthetic pathway from zymomonas mobilis was introduced into the engineered strain. as a consequence, the resulting strain was able to simultaneously metabolize glucose and xylose and consume all sugars (30 g/l each) in 16 h, leading to 97% of the theoretical ethanol yield. overall, this indicates that this approach is effective and straightforward to engineer e. coli for the desired trait.

TI  == inhibition of growth of zymomonas mobilis by model compounds found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates.
AB  == background: during the pretreatment of biomass feedstocks and subsequent conditioning prior to saccharification, many toxic compounds are produced or introduced which inhibit microbial growth and in many cases, production of ethanol. an understanding of the toxic effects of compounds found in hydrolysate  is critical to improving sugar utilization and ethanol yields in the fermentation process. in this study, we established a useful tool for surveying hydrolysate toxicity by measuring growth rates in the presence of toxic compounds, and examined the effects of selected model inhibitors of aldehydes, organic and inorganic acids (along with various cations), and alcohols on growth of zymomonas mobilis 8b (a zm4 derivative) using glucose or xylose as the carbon source. results: toxicity strongly correlated to hydrophobicity in z. mobilis, which has  been observed in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae for aldehydes and  with some exceptions, organic acids. we observed z. mobilis 8b to be more tolerant to organic acids than previously reported, although the carbon source and growth conditions play a role in tolerance. growth in xylose was profoundly inhibited by monocarboxylic organic acids compared to growth in glucose, whereas  dicarboxylic acids demonstrated little or no effects on growth rate in either substrate. furthermore, cations can be ranked in order of their toxicity, ca++ >  > na+ > nh4+ > k+. hmf (5-hydroxymethylfurfural), furfural and acetate, which were observed to contribute to inhibition of z. mobilis growth in dilute acid pretreated corn stover hydrolysate, do not interact in a synergistic manner in combination. we provide further evidence that z. mobilis 8b is capable of converting the aldehydes furfural, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and to some extent syringaldehyde to their alcohol forms (furfuryl, vanillyl, 4-hydroxybenzyl and syringyl alcohol) during fermentation. conclusions: several key findings in this report provide a mechanism for predicting toxic contributions of inhibitory  components of hydrolysate and provide guidance for potential process development, along with potential future strain improvement and tolerance strategies.

TI  == use of an ez-tn5-based random mutagenesis system to create a zymomonas mobilis with significant tolerance to heat stress and malnutrition.
AB  == during ethanol production, the fermentation cells are always exposed to stresses  like high temperature and low nutritional conditions, which affect their growth and productivity. stress-tolerant strains with high ethanol yield are highly desirable. therefore, a recombinant zymomonas mobilis (z. mobilis) designated as  hym was constructed by integrating three genes (yfdz, metb, and pfu-shsp) into the genome of z. mobilis cp4 (cp4) via tn5 transposon in the present study. the yfdz and metb genes from e. coli were used to decrease the nutritional requirement. the small heat shock protein gene (pfu-shsp) from pyrococcus furiosus (p. furiosus) was used to increase the heat tolerance. the genomic integration of three genes confers on z. mobilis the ability to grow in simple chemical defined medium without the addition of amino acid. the hym not only demonstrated the high tolerance to unfavorable lower nutrition stresses but also  the capability of converting glucose to ethanol with high yield at higher temperature. what is more, these genetic characteristics were stable up to 100 generations on nonselective medium. the effects of glucose concentration, fermentation temperature, and initial ph on ethanol production of the mutant strain hym were optimized using a box-behnken design (bbd) experiment. the integration of three genes led to a significant increase in ethanol production by 9 % compared with its original z. mobilis counterpart. the maximum ethanol production of hym was as high as 105 g/l.

TI  == use of a tn5-based transposon system to create a cost-effective zymomonas mobilis for ethanol production from lignocelluloses.
AB  == background: current methods of ethanol production from lignocelluloses generate a mixture of sugars, primarily glucose and xylose; the fermentation cells are always exposed to stresses like high temperature and low nutritional conditions that affect their growth and productivity. stress-tolerant strains capable of using both glucose and xylose to produce ethanol with high yield are highly desirable. results: a recombinant zymomonas mobilis (z. mobilis) designated as hymx was constructed by integrating seven genes (pfu-shsp, yfdz, metb, xyla, xylb, tkta and talb) into the genome of z. mobilis cp4 (cp4) via tn5 transposon in the present study. the small heat shock protein gene (pfu-shsp) from pyrococcus furious (p. furious) was used to increase the heat-tolerance, the yfdz and metb genes from e. coli were used to decrease the nutritional requirement. to overcome the bottleneck of cp4 being unable to use pentose, xylose catabolic genes (xyla, xylb, tkta and talb) from e. coli were integrated into cp4 also for  construction of the xylose utilizing metabolic pathway. conclusions: the genomic  integration confers on z. mobilis the ability to grow in medium containing xylose as the only carbon source, and to grow in simple chemical defined medium without  addition of amino acid. the hymx demonstrated not only the high tolerance to unfavorable stresses like high temperature and low nutrient, but also the capability of converting both glucose and xylose to ethanol with high yield at high temperature. what's more, these genetic characteristics were stable up to 100 generations on nonselective medium. although significant improvements were achieved, yeast extract is needed for ethanol production.

TI  == impact of expression of emp enzymes on glucose metabolism in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == zymomonas mobilis is the only known microorganism that utilizes the entner-doudoroff (ed) pathway anaerobically. in this work, we investigated whether the overexpression of a phosphofructokinase (pfk), the only missing embden-meyerhof-parnas (emp) pathway enzyme, could establish the pathway in this  organism. introduction of a pyrophosphate-dependent pfk, along with co-expression of homologous fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and triosephosphate isomerase, did not result in an emp flux to any appreciable level. however, the metabolism of glucose was impacted significantly. eight percent of glucose was metabolized to form a new metabolite, dihydroxyacetone. reducing flux through the ed pathway  by as much as 40 % through antisense of a key enzyme, ed aldolase, did not result in a fully functional emp pathway, suggesting that the ed pathway, especially the lower arm, downstream from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is very rigid, possibly due to redox balance.

TI  == indirect and suboptimal control of gene expression is widespread in bacteria.
AB  == gene regulation in bacteria is usually described as an adaptive response to an environmental change so that genes are expressed when they are required. we instead propose that most genes are under indirect control: their expression responds to signal(s) that are not directly related to the genes' function. indirect control should perform poorly in artificial conditions, and we show that gene regulation is often maladaptive in the laboratory. in shewanella oneidensis  mr-1, 24% of genes are detrimental to fitness in some conditions, and detrimental genes tend to be highly expressed instead of being repressed when not needed. in  diverse bacteria, there is little correlation between when genes are important for optimal growth or fitness and when those genes are upregulated. two common types of indirect control are constitutive expression and regulation by growth rate; these occur for genes with diverse functions and often seem to be suboptimal. because genes that have closely related functions can have dissimilar expression patterns, regulation may be suboptimal in the wild as well as in the laboratory.

TI  == surface display of a redox enzyme and its site-specific wiring to gold electrodes.
AB  == the generation of a current through interaction between bacteria and electrodes has been explored by various methods. we demonstrate the attachment of living bacteria through a surface displayed redox enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase ii. the  unnatural amino acid para-azido-l-phenylalanine was incorporated into a specific  site of the displayed enzyme, facilitating electron transfer between the enzyme and an electrode. in order to attach the bacteria carrying the surface displayed  enzyme to a surface, a linker containing an alkyne and a thiol moiety on opposite ends was synthesized and attached to the dehydrogenase site specifically through  a copper(i)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. using this approach we were able to covalently link bacteria to gold-coated surfaces and to gold nanoparticles, while maintaining viability and catalytic activity. we show the performance of a biofuel cell using these modified bacteria at the anode, which resulted in site-specific dependent fuel cell performance for at least a week. this is the first example of site-specific attachment of a true living biohybrid  to inorganic material.

TI  == engineering an anaerobic metabolic regime in pseudomonas putida kt2440 for the anoxic biodegradation of 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene.
AB  == pseudomonas putida kt2440, a microbial cell factory of reference for industrial whole-cell biocatalysis, is unable to support biochemical reactions that occur under anoxic conditions, limiting its utility for a large number of relevant biotransformations. unlike (facultative) anaerobes, p. putida resorts to nadh oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation  metabolism. therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., atp/adp and nadh/nad(+)) that are required to sustain an o(2)-free lifestyle. to overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (acka) gene of the facultative anaerobe escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase ii (adhb) genes of the aerotolerant zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type p. putida strain. biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. the resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. these results underscore the value  of p. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.

TI  == transcriptome profiling of zymomonas mobilis under ethanol stress.
AB  == background: high tolerance to ethanol is a desirable characteristics for ethanologenic strains used in industrial ethanol fermentation. a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanologenic strains tolerance of ethanol stress may guide the design of rational strategies to increase process performance in industrial alcoholic production. many extensive studies have been performed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and escherichia coli. however, the physiological basis and genetic mechanisms involved in ethanol tolerance for zymomonas mobilis are poorly understood on genomic level. to identify the genes required for tolerance to ethanol, microarray technology was used to investigate the transcriptome profiling of the ethanologenic z. mobilis in response to ethanol stress. results: we successfully identified 127 genes which were differentially expressed in response to ethanol. ethanol up- or down-regulated genes related to cell wall/membrane biogenesis, metabolism, and transcription. these genes were classified as being involved in a wide range of cellular processes including carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, respiratory chain, terpenoid biosynthesis, dna replication, dna recombination, dna repair, transport, transcriptional regulation, some universal  stress response, etc. conclusion: in this study, genome-wide transcriptional responses to ethanol were investigated for the first time in z. mobilis using microarray analysis.our results revealed that ethanol had effects on multiple aspects of cellular metabolism at the transcriptional level and that membrane might play important roles in response to ethanol. although the molecular mechanism involved in tolerance and adaptation of ethanologenic strains to ethanol is still unclear, this research has provided insights into molecular response to ethanol in z. mobilis. these data will also be helpful to construct more ethanol resistant strains for cellulosic ethanol production in the future.

TI  == heterologous expression of plant cell wall degrading enzymes for effective production of cellulosic biofuels.
AB  == a major technical challenge in the cost-effective production of cellulosic biofuel is the need to lower the cost of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (pcde), which is required for the production of sugars from biomass. several competitive, low-cost technologies have been developed to produce pcde in different host organisms such as escherichia coli, zymomonas mobilis, and plant.  selection of an ideal host organism is very important, because each host organism has its own unique features. synthetic biology-aided tools enable heterologous expression of pcde in recombinant e. coli or z. mobilis and allow successful consolidated bioprocessing (cbp) in these microorganisms. in-planta expression provides an opportunity to simplify the process of enzyme production and plant biomass processing and leads to self-deconstruction of plant cell walls. although the future of currently available technologies is difficult to predict, a complete and viable platform will most likely be available through the integration of the existing approaches with the development of breakthrough technologies.

TI  == recruiting alternative glucose utilization pathways for improving succinate production.
AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (pts) of escherichia coli was usually inactivated to increase pep supply for succinate production. however, cell growth and glucose utilization rate decreased significantly with pts inactivation. in this work, two glucose transport proteins and two glucokinases (glk) from e. coli and zymomonas mobilis were recruited in pts(-) strains, and their impacts on glucose utilization and succinate production were compared. all pts(-) strains recruiting z. mobilis glucose facilitator glf had higher glucose utilization rates than pts(-) strains using e. coli galactose  permease (galp), which was suggested to be caused by higher glucose transport velocity and lower energetic cost of glf. the highest rate obtained by combinatorial modulation of glf and glk e. coli (2.13 g/l*h) was 81 % higher than the wild-type e. coli and 30 % higher than the highest rate obtained by combinatorial modulation of galp and glk e. coli . on the other hand, although glucokinase activities increased after replacing e. coli glk with isoenzyme of z. mobilis, glucose utilization rate decreased to 0.58 g/l*h, which was assumed due  to tight regulation of z. mobilis glk by energy status of the cells. for succinate production, using galp led to a 20 % increase in succinate productivity, while recruiting glf led to a 41 % increase. these efficient alternative glucose utilization pathways obtained in this work can also be used for production of many other pep-derived chemicals, such as malate, fumarate, and aromatic compounds.

TI  == from lin-benzoguanines to lin-benzohypoxanthines as ligands for zymomonas mobilis trna-guanine transglycosylase: replacement of protein-ligand hydrogen bonding by  importing water clusters.
AB  == the foodborne illness shigellosis is caused by shigella bacteria that secrete the highly cytotoxic shiga toxin, which is also formed by the closely related enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec). it has been shown that trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt) is essential for the pathogenicity of shigella flexneri. herein, the molecular recognition properties of a guanine binding pocket in zymomonas mobilis tgt are investigated with a series of lin-benzohypoxanthine- and lin-benzoguanine-based inhibitors that bear substituents to occupy either the ribose-33 or the ribose-34 pocket. the three inhibitor scaffolds differ by the substituent at c(6) being h, nh(2), or nh-alkyl. these differences lead to major  changes in the inhibition constants, pk(a) values, and binding modes. compared to the lin-benzoguanines, with an exocyclic nh(2) at c(6), the lin-benzohypoxanthines without an exocyclic nh(2) group have a weaker affinity as several ionic protein-ligand hydrogen bonds are lost. x-ray cocrystal structure analysis reveals that a new water cluster is imported into the space vacated by the lacking nh(2) group and by a conformational shift of the side chain of catalytic asp102. in the presence of an n-alkyl group at c(6) in lin-benzoguanine ligands, this water cluster is largely maintained but replacement of one of the water molecules in the cluster leads to a substantial loss in binding affinity. this study provides new insight into the role of water clusters at enzyme active  sites and their challenging substitution by ligand parts, a topic of general interest in contemporary structure-based drug design.

TI  == ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass by recombinant escherichia coli strain fbr5.
AB  == lignocellulosic biomass, upon pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, generates a  mixture of hexose and pentose sugars such as glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. while escherichia coli utilizes all these sugars it lacks the ability  to produce ethanol from them. recombinant ethanologenic e. coli strains have been created with a goal to produce ethanol from both hexose and pentose sugars. herein, we review the current state of the art on the production of ethanol from  lignocellulosic hydrolyzates by an ethanologenic recombinant e. coli strain (fbr5). the bacterium is stable without antibiotics and can tolerate ethanol up to 50 gl(-1). it produces up to 45 g ethanol per l and has the potential to be used for industrial production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates.

TI  == implantation of unmarked regulatory and metabolic modules in gram-negative bacteria with specialised mini-transposon delivery vectors.
AB  == engineering of robust and safe microbial cell factories requires genetic tools somewhat different from those traditionally used for laboratory-adapted microorganisms. we took advantage of the properties of broad-host-range mini-tn5  vectors and two regulated expression systems (laci(q)/p(trc) and xyls/pm), together with frt-flanked, excisable antibiotic resistance determinants, to generate a set of vectors for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria. this arrangement of modular elements allows the cloning and subsequent markerless insertion of expression cargoes and leaves behind an antibiotic-sensitive host upon the action of the yeast flp recombinase. we engineered a pseudomonas putida kt2440 pm::gfp strain that displayed strong fluorescence upon exposure to 3-methylbenzoate, a xyls effector, and allowed us to examine the performance of the pm promoter at the single cell level. we also reconstructed a device for sugar transport and phosphorylation in escherichia coli independent of the native phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system by the stable implantation of genes derived from the obligate anaerobe zymomonas mobilis. in both cases, the information carried by the implanted genes  was stably inherited in the absence of any selective pressure. deliverable expression systems such as those described here will enhance the applicability of various gram-negative bacteria in biocatalysis and environmental bioremediation.

TI  == ethanol production from wood hydrolysate using genetically engineered zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == an ethanologenic microorganism capable of fermenting all of the sugars released from lignocellulosic biomass through a saccharification process is essential for  secondary bioethanol production. we therefore genetically engineered the ethanologenic bacterium zymomonas mobilis such that it efficiently produced bioethanol from the hydrolysate of wood biomass containing glucose, mannose, and  xylose as major sugar components. this was accomplished by introducing genes encoding mannose and xylose catabolic enzymes from escherichia coli. integration  of e. coli mana into z. mobilis chromosomal dna conferred the ability to co-ferment mannose and glucose, producing 91 % of the theoretical yield of ethanol within 36 h. then, by introducing a recombinant plasmid harboring the genes encoding e. coli xyla, xylb, tal, and tkta, we broadened the range of fermentable sugar substrates for z. mobilis to include mannose and xylose as well as glucose. the resultant strain was able to ferment a mixture of 20 g/l glucose, 20 g/l mannose, and 20 g/l xylose as major sugar components of wood hydrolysate within 72 h, producing 89.8 % of the theoretical yield. the recombinant z. mobilis also efficiently fermented actual acid hydrolysate prepared from cellulosic feedstock containing glucose, mannose, and xylose. moreover, a reactor packed with the strain continuously produced ethanol from acid hydrolysate of wood biomass from coniferous trees for 10 days without accumulation of residual sugars. ethanol productivity was at 10.27 g/l h at a dilution rate of 0.25 h(-1).

TI  == increase in furfural tolerance in ethanologenic escherichia coli ly180 by plasmid-based expression of thya.
AB  == furfural is an inhibitory side product formed during the depolymerization of hemicellulose by mineral acids. genomic libraries from three different bacteria (bacillus subtilis yb886, escherichia coli nc3, and zymomonas mobilis cp4) were screened for genes that conferred furfural resistance on plates. beneficial plasmids containing the thya gene (coding for thymidylate synthase) were recovered from all three organisms. expression of this key gene in the de novo pathway for dtmp biosynthesis improved furfural resistance on plates and during fermentation. a similar benefit was observed by supplementation with thymine, thymidine, or the combination of tetrahydrofolate and serine (precursors for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, the methyl donor for thya). supplementation with  deoxyuridine provided a small benefit, and deoxyribose was of no benefit for furfural tolerance. a combination of thymidine and plasmid expression of thya was no more effective than either alone. together, these results demonstrate that furfural tolerance is increased by approaches that increase the supply of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides. however, thya activity was not directly affected by the addition of furfural. furfural has been previously shown to damage dna in  e. coli and to activate a cellular response to oxidative damage in yeast. the added burden of repairing furfural-damaged dna in e. coli would be expected to increase the cellular requirement for dtmp. increased expression of thya (e. coli, b. subtilis, or z. mobilis), supplementation of cultures with thymidine, and supplementation with precursors for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (methyl donor) are each proposed to increase furfural tolerance by increasing the availability of dtmp for dna repair.

TI  == optical mapping and sequencing of the escherichia coli ko11 genome reveal extensive chromosomal rearrangements, and multiple tandem copies of the zymomonas mobilis pdc and adhb genes.
AB  == escherichia coli ko11 (atcc 55124) was engineered in 1990 to produce ethanol by chromosomal insertion of the zymomonas mobilis pdc and adhb genes into e. coli w  (atcc 9637). ko11fl, our current laboratory version of ko11, and its parent e. coli w were sequenced, and contigs assembled into genomic sequences using optical ncoi restriction maps as templates. e. coli w contained plasmids prk1 (102.5 kb)  and prk2 (5.4 kb), but ko11fl only contained prk2. ko11fl optical maps made with  aflii and with bamhi showed a tandem repeat region, consisting of at least 20 copies of a 10-kb unit. the repeat region was located at the insertion site for the pdc, adhb, and chloramphenicol-resistance genes. sequence coverage of these genes was about 25-fold higher than average, consistent with amplification of the foreign genes that were inserted as circularized dna. selection for higher levels of chloramphenicol resistance originally produced strains with higher pdc and adhb expression, and hence improved fermentation performance, by increasing the gene copy number. sequence data for an earlier version of ko11, atcc 55124, indicated that multiple copies of pdc adhb were present. comparison of the w and  ko11fl genomes showed large inversions and deletions in ko11fl, mostly enabled by is10, which is absent from w but present at 30 sites in ko11fl. the early ko11 strain atcc 55124 had no rearrangements, contained only one is10, and lacked most accumulated single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) present in ko11fl. despite rearrangements and snps in ko11fl, fermentation performance was equal to that of  atcc 55124.

TI  == engineering yield and rate of reductive biotransformation in escherichia coli by  partial cyclization of the pentose phosphate pathway and pts-independent glucose  transport.
AB  == optimization of yields and productivities in reductive whole-cell biotransformations is an important issue for the industrial application of such processes. in a recent study with escherichia coli, we analyzed the reduction of  the prochiral beta-ketoester methyl acetoacetate by an r-specific alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) to the chiral hydroxy ester (r)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (mhb) using glucose as substrate for the generation of nadph. deletion of the phosphofructokinase gene pfka almost doubled the yield to 4.8 mol mhb per mole of glucose, and it was assumed that this effect was due to a partial cyclization of  the pentose phosphate pathway (ppp). here, this partial cyclization was confirmed by (13)c metabolic flux analysis, which revealed a negative net flux from glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase. for further process optimization, the genes encoding the glucose facilitator (glf) and glucokinase (glk) of zymomonas mobilis were overexpressed in recombinant e. coli strains carrying adh and deletions of either pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase), or pfka, or pfka plus pfkb. in all cases, the glucose uptake rate was increased (30-47%), and for strains deltapgi and deltapfka also, the specific mhb production rate was increased by 15% and 20%, respectively. the yield of the latter two strains slightly dropped by 11% and 6%, but was still 73% and 132% higher compared to the reference strain with intact pgi and pfka genes and expressing glf and glk. thus, metabolic engineering strategies are presented for  improving yield and rate of reductive redox biocatalysis by partial cyclization of the ppp and by increasing glucose uptake, respectively.

AB  == biodiesel is a renewable alternative to petroleum diesel fuel that can contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction and energy supply. biodiesel is composed of  fatty acid alkyl esters, including fatty acid methyl esters (fames) and fatty acid ethyl esters (faees), and is currently produced through the transesterification reaction of methanol (or ethanol) and triacylglycerols (tags). tags are mainly obtained from oilseed plants and microalgae. a sustainable supply of tags is a major bottleneck for current biodiesel production. here we report the de novo biosynthesis of faees from glucose, which  can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, in genetically engineered escherichia coli by introduction of the ethanol-producing pathway from zymomonas  mobilis, genetic manipulation to increase the pool of fatty acyl-coa, and heterologous expression of acyl-coenzyme a: diacylglycerol acyltransferase from acinetobacter baylyi. an optimized fed-batch microbial fermentation of the modified e. coli strain yielded a titer of 922 mg l(-1) faees that consisted primarily of ethyl palmitate, -oleate, -myristate and -palmitoleate.

AB  == the gram-negative facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacterium ralstonia eutropha  strain h16 is known for its narrow carbohydrate utilization range, which limits its use for biotechnological production of polyhydroxyalkanoates and possibly other products from renewable resources. to broaden its substrate utilization range, which is for carbohydrates and related compounds limited to fructose, n-acetylglucosamine, and gluconate, strain h16 was engineered to use mannose and  glucose as sole carbon sources for growth. the genes for a facilitated diffusion  protein (glf) from zymomonas mobilis and for a glucokinase (glk), mannofructokinase (mak), and phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) from escherichia coli were alone or in combination constitutively expressed in r. eutropha strain h16 under the control of the neokanamycin or lac promoter, respectively, using an episomal broad-host-range vector. recombinant strains harboring pbbr1mcs-3::glf::mak::pmi or pbbr1mcs-3::glf::pmi grew on mannose, whereas pbbr1mcs-3::glf::mak and pbbr1mcs-3::glf did not confer the ability to utilize mannose as a carbon source to r. eutropha. the recombinant strain harboring pbbr1mcs-3::glf::pmi exhibited slower growth on mannose than the recombinant strain harboring pbbr1mcs-3::glf::mak::pmi. these data indicated that phosphomannose isomerase is required to convert mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate for subsequent catabolism via the entner-doudoroff pathway.  in addition, all plasmids also conferred to r. eutropha the ability to grow in the presence of glucose. the best growth was observed with a recombinant r. eutropha strain harboring plasmid pbbr1mcs-2::p(nk)::glk::glf. in addition, expression of the respective enzymes was demonstrated at the transcriptional and  protein levels and by measuring the activities of mannofructokinase (0.622 +/- 0.063 u mg(-1)), phosphomannose isomerase (0.251 +/- 0.017 u mg(-1)), and glucokinase (0.518 +/- 0.040 u mg(-1)). cells of recombinant strains of r. eutropha synthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) to ca. 65 to 67% (wt/wt) of the cell dry mass in the presence of 1% (wt/vol) glucose or mannose as the sole carbon sources.

AB  == background: zymomonas mobilis zm4 is a gram-negative bacterium that can efficiently produce ethanol from various carbon substrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, via the entner-doudoroff pathway. however, systems metabolic engineering is required to further enhance its metabolic performance for industrial application. as an important step towards this goal, the genome-scale metabolic model of z. mobilis is required to systematically analyze  in silico the metabolic characteristics of this bacterium under a wide range of genotypic and environmental conditions. results: the genome-scale metabolic model of z. mobilis zm4, zmombel601, was reconstructed based on its annotated genes, literature, physiological and biochemical databases. the metabolic model comprises 579 metabolites and 601 metabolic reactions (571 biochemical conversion and 30 transport reactions), built upon extensive search of existing knowledge. physiological features of z. mobilis were then examined using constraints-based flux analysis in detail as follows. first, the physiological changes of z. mobilis as it shifts from anaerobic to aerobic environments (i.e. aerobic shift)  were investigated. then the intensities of flux-sum, which is the cluster of either all ingoing or outgoing fluxes through a metabolite, and the maximum in silico yields of ethanol for z. mobilis and escherichia coli were compared and analyzed. furthermore, the substrate utilization range of z. mobilis was expanded to include pentose sugar metabolism by introducing metabolic pathways to allow z. mobilis to utilize pentose sugars. finally, double gene knock-out simulations were performed to design a strategy for efficiently producing succinic acid as another example of application of the genome-scale metabolic model of z. mobilis. conclusion: the genome-scale metabolic model reconstructed in this study was able to successfully represent the metabolic characteristics of z. mobilis under various conditions as validated by experiments and literature information. this reconstructed metabolic model will allow better understanding of z. mobilis metabolism and consequently designing metabolic engineering strategies for various biotechnological applications.

TI  == enabling unbalanced fermentations by using engineered electrode-interfaced bacteria.
AB  == cellular metabolism is a series of tightly linked oxidations and reductions that  must be balanced. recycling of intracellular electron carriers during fermentation often requires substrate conversion to undesired products, while respiration demands constant addition of electron acceptors. the use of electrode-based electron acceptors to balance biotransformations may overcome these constraints. to test this hypothesis, the metal-reducing bacterium shewanella oneidensis was engineered to stoichiometrically convert glycerol into  ethanol, a biotransformation that will not occur unless two electrons are removed via an external reaction, such as electrode reduction. multiple modules were combined into a single plasmid to alter s. oneidensis metabolism: a glycerol module, consisting of glpf, glpk, glpd, and tpia from escherichia coli, and an ethanol module containing pdc and adh from zymomonas mobilis. a further increase  in product yields was accomplished through knockout of pta, encoding phosphate acetyltransferase, shifting flux toward ethanol and away from acetate production. in this first-generation demonstration, conversion of glycerol to ethanol required the presence of an electrode to balance the reaction, and electrode-linked rates were on par with volumetric conversion rates observed in engineered e. coli. linking microbial biocatalysis to current production can eliminate redox constraints by shifting other unbalanced reactions to yield pure  products and serve as a new platform for next-generation bioproduction strategies.

AB  == enterobactercloacae was isolated from the gut of the wood feeding termite, heterotermes indicola, and a 2.25-kb fragment conferring cellulase activity was cloned in escherichia coli. the cloned fragment contained a 1083-bp orf which could encode a protein belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 8. the cellulase gene was introduced into zymomonas mobilis strain microbial type culture collection centre (mtcc) on a plasmid and 0.134 filter paper activity unit (fpu)/ml units of cellulase activity was observed with the recombinant bacterium. using carboxymethyl cellulose and 4% naoh pretreated bagasse as substrates, the recombinant strain produced 5.5% and 4% (v/v) ethanol respectively, which was threefold higher than the amount obtained with the original e.cloacae isolate. the recombinant z. mobilis strain could be improved further by simultaneous expression of cellulase cocktails before utilizing it for industrial level ethanol production.

TI  == genome-scale modeling and in silico analysis of ethanologenic bacteria zymomonas  mobilis.
AB  == bioethanol has been recognized as a potential alternative energy source. among various ethanol-producing microbes, zymomonas mobilis has acquired special attention due to its higher ethanol yield and tolerance. however, cellular metabolism in z. mobilis remains unclear, hindering its practical application for bioethanol production. to elucidate such physiological characteristics, we reconstructed and validated a genome-scale metabolic network (izm363) of z. mobilis atcc31821 (zm4) based on its annotated genome and biochemical information. the phenotypic behaviors and metabolic states predicted by our genome-scale model were highly consistent with the experimental observations of z. mobilis zm4 strain growing on glucose as well as nmr-measured intracellular fluxes of an engineered strain utilizing glucose, fructose, and xylose. subsequent comparative analysis with escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as gene essentiality and flux coupling analyses have also confirmed the functional role of pdc and adh genes in the ethanologenic activity  of z. mobilis, thus leading to better understanding of this natural ethanol producer. in future, the current model could be employed to identify potential cell engineering targets, thereby enhancing the productivity of ethanol in z. mobilis.

TI  == simultaneous consumption of pentose and hexose sugars: an optimal microbial phenotype for efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass.
AB  == lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive carbon source for bio-based fuel and chemical production; however, its compositional heterogeneity hinders its commercial use. since most microbes possess carbon catabolite repression (ccr), mixed sugars derived from the lignocellulose are consumed sequentially, reducing  the efficacy of the overall process. to overcome this barrier, microbes that exhibit the simultaneous consumption of mixed sugars have been isolated and/or developed and evaluated for the lignocellulosic biomass utilization. specific strains of escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and zymomonas mobilis have been engineered for simultaneous glucose and xylose utilization via mutagenesis or introduction of a xylose metabolic pathway. other microbes, such as lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, and candida shehatae possess a relaxed ccr mechanism, showing simultaneous consumption of glucose and xylose. by exploiting ccr-negative phenotypes, various integrated processes have been developed that incorporate both enzyme hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material and mixed sugar fermentation, thereby enabling greater productivity and fermentation  efficacy.

TI  == adaptive evolution of escherichia coli inactivated in the phosphotransferase system operon improves co-utilization of xylose and glucose under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == modification of the phosphoenolpyruvate/sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) has shown improvement in sugar coassimilation in escherichia coli production strains. however, in preliminary experiments under anaerobic conditions, e. coli strains with an inactive pts and carrying ploi1594, which encodes pyruvate decarboxylase  and alcohol dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis, were unable to grow. these pts(-) strains were previously evolved under aerobic conditions to grow rapidly in glucose (pts(-) glucose+ phenotype). thus, in this work, applying a continuous culture strategy under anaerobic conditions, we generate a new set of evolved pts(-) glucose+ mutants, vh30n1 to vh30n6. contrary to aerobically evolved mutants, strains vh30n2 and vh30n4 carrying ploi1594 grew in anaerobiosis; also,  their growth capacity was restored in a 100%, showing specific growth rates (mu ~ 0.12 h(-)(1)) similar to the pts+ parental strain (mu = 0.11 h(-)(1)). in cultures of vh30n2/ploi1594 and vh30n4/ploi1594 using a glucose-xylose mixture, xylose was totally consumed and consumption of sugars occurred in a simultaneous  manner indicating that catabolic repression is alleviated in these strains. also, the efficient sugar coassimilation by the evolved strains caused an increment in  the ethanol yields.

TI  == comparing the fermentation performance of escherichia coli ko11, saccharomyces cerevisiae 424a(lnh-st) and zymomonas mobilis ax101 for cellulosic ethanol production.
AB  == background: fermentations using escherichia coli ko11, saccharomyces cerevisiae 424a(lnh-st), and zymomonas mobilis ax101 are compared side-by-side on corn steep liquor (csl) media and the water extract and enzymatic hydrolysate from ammonia fiber expansion (afex)-pretreated corn stover. results: the three ethanologens are able produce ethanol from a csl-supplemented co-fermentation at a metabolic yield, final concentration and rate greater than 0.42 g/g consumed sugars, 40 g/l and 0.7 g/l/h (0-48 h), respectively. xylose-only fermentation of the tested ethanologenic bacteria are five to eight times faster than 424a(lnh-st) in the csl fermentation.all tested strains grow and co-ferment sugars at 15% w/v solids  loading equivalent of ammonia fiber explosion (afex)-pretreated corn stover water extract. however, both ko11 and 424a(lnh-st) exhibit higher growth robustness than ax101. in 18% w/w solids loading lignocellulosic hydrolysate from afex pretreatment, complete glucose fermentations can be achieved at a rate greater than 0.77 g/l/h. in contrast to results from fermentation in csl, s. cerevisiae 424a(lnh-st) consumed xylose at the greatest extent and rate in the hydrolysate compared to the bacteria tested. conclusions: our results confirm that glucose fermentations among the tested strains are effective even at high solids loading  (18% by weight). however, xylose consumption in the lignocellulosic hydrolysate is the major bottleneck affecting overall yield, titer or rate of the process. in comparison, saccharomyces cerevisiae 424a(lnh-st) is the most relevant strains for industrial production for its ability to ferment both glucose and xylose from undetoxified and unsupplemented hydrolysate from afex-pretreated corn stover at high yield.

TI  == an evolved xylose transporter from zymomonas mobilis enhances sugar transport in  escherichia coli.
AB  == background: xylose is a second most abundant sugar component of lignocellulose besides glucose. efficient fermentation of xylose is important for the economics  of biomass-based biorefineries. however, sugar mixtures are sequentially consumed in xylose co-fermentation with glucose due to carbon catabolite repression (ccr)  in microorganisms. as xylose transmembrance transport is one of the steps repressed by ccr, it is therefore of interest to develop a transporter that is less sensitive to the glucose inhibition or ccr. results: the glucose facilitator protein glf transporter from zymomonas mobilis, also an efficient transporter for xylose, was chosen as the target transporter for engineering to eliminate glucose inhibition on xylose uptake. the evolution of glf transporter was carried out with a mixture of glucose and xylose in e. coli. error-prone pcr and random deletion were employed respectively in two rounds of evolution. aided by a high-throughput screening assay using xylose analog p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx) in 96-well plates, a best mutant 2-rd5 was obtained that contains several mutations, and a deletion of 134 residues (about 28% of total residues), or three fewer transmembrane sections (tmss). it showed a 10.8-fold improvement in terms of pnpx transport activity in the presence of glucose. the fermentation performance results showed that this mutant improved xylose consumption by 42% with m9 minimal medium containing 20 g l-1 xylose only, while with the mixture sugar of xylose and glucose, 28% more glucose was consumed, but no obvious co-utilization of xylose was observed. further glucose fed-batch experiments suggested that the intracellular metabolism of xylose was repressed by glucose. conclusions: through random mutagenesis and partial deletion coupled with high-throughput screening, a mutant of the glf transporter (2-rd5) was obtained that relieved the inhibition of xylose transport by glucose. the fermentation tests revealed that 2-rd5 was advantageous in xylose and glucose uptakes, while no obvious advantage was seen for xylose co-consumption when co-fermented with glucose. further efforts could focus on reducing ccr-mediated repression of intracellular metabolism of xylose. glf should also serve as a useful model to further exploit the molecular mechanism of xylose transport and the ccr-mediated inhibition.

TI  == engineering of bio-hybrid materials by electrospinning polymer-microbe fibers.
AB  == although microbes have been used in industrial and niche applications for several decades, successful immobilization of microbes while maintaining their usefulness for any desired application has been elusive. such a functionally bioactive system has distinct advantages over conventional batch and continuous-flow microbial reactor systems that are used in various biotechnological processes. this article describes the use of polyethylene oxide(99)-polypropylene oxide(67)-polyethylene oxide(99) triblock polymer fibers, created via electrospinning, to encapsulate microbes of 3 industrially relevant genera, namely, pseudomonas, zymomonas, and escherichia. the presence of bacteria inside  the fibers was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and sem. although the electrospinning process typically uses harsh organic solvents and extreme conditions that generally are harmful to bacteria, we describe techniques that overcome these limitations. the encapsulated microbes were viable for several months, and their metabolic activity was not affected by immobilization; thus they could be used in various applications. furthermore, we have engineered a microbe-encapsulated cross-linked fibrous polymeric material that is insoluble. also, the microbe-encapsulated active matrix permits efficient exchange of nutrients and metabolic products between the microorganism and the environment. the present results demonstrate the potential of the electrospinning technique for the encapsulation and immobilization of bacteria in the form of a synthetic biofilm, while retaining their metabolic activity. this study has wide-ranging implications in the engineering and use of novel bio-hybrid materials or biological thin-film catalysts.

TI  == genetic engineering of enterobacter asburiae strain jdr-1 for efficient production of ethanol from hemicellulose hydrolysates.
AB  == dilute acid pretreatment is an established method for hydrolyzing the methylglucuronoxylans of hemicellulose to release fermentable xylose. in addition to xylose, this process releases the aldouronate methylglucuronoxylose, which cannot be metabolized by current ethanologenic biocatalysts. enterobacter asburiae jdr-1, isolated from colonized wood, was found to efficiently ferment both methylglucuronoxylose and xylose in acid hydrolysates of sweet gum xylan, producing predominantly ethanol and acetate. transformation of e. asburiae jdr-1  with ploi555 or ploi297, each containing the pet operon containing pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase b (adhb) genes derived from zymomonas mobilis, replaced mixed-acid fermentation with homoethanol fermentation. deletion of the pyruvate formate lyase (pflb) gene further increased the ethanol yield, resulting in a stable e. asburiae e1(ploi555) strain that efficiently utilized both xylose and methylglucuronoxylose in dilute acid hydrolysates of sweet gum xylan. ethanol was produced from xylan hydrolysate by e. asburiae e1(ploi555) with a yield that was 99% of the theoretical maximum yield and at a rate of 0.11 g ethanol/g (dry weight) cells/h, which was 1.57 times the yield and 1.48 times the rate obtained with the ethanologenic strain escherichia coli ko11. this engineered derivative of e. asburiae jdr-1 that is able to ferment the predominant hexoses and pentoses derived from both hemicellulose and cellulose fractions is a promising subject for development as an ethanologenic biocatalyst for production of fuels and chemicals from agricultural residues and energy crops.

TI  == characterization of multiple promoters and transcript stability in the sacb-sacc  gene cluster in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == in zymomonas mobilis, the extracellular levansucrase (sacb) and extracellular sucrase (sacc) are involved in sucrose hydrolysis. genes coding for these two enzymes (sacb and sacc) are arranged in a cluster in the genome and separated by  a short intervening sequence. the level of sacc transcript was 12-fold higher than that of sacb transcript. on the other hand, transcript stability analysis in sucrose grown cultures revealed that the half-life of the sacb transcripts (153 s) was more than twofold higher than that of sacc transcript (66 s). the decay curves of sacb and sacc transcripts analyzed by the semi-quantitative rt-pcr correlated well with the decay curves of the respective enzyme activities. in the sacb promoter disruption mutant, z. moblis bt2, the extracellular sucrase activity decreased from 2.6 to 2.0 u mg(-1) in sucrose medium due to the loss of  sacb expression. the expression of sacc in the absence of the sacb promoter suggested that these two genes could be transcribed as different mrnas. the promoter-lacz fusion studies in escherichia coli proved that the short intervening region acts as a strong promoter for the sacc gene.

TI  == optimization of metabolic pathways for bioconversion of lignocellulose to ethanol through genetic engineering.
AB  == the optimization of metabolic pathways is of fundamental importance for strategies aimed at improving the economics and yield of the lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes. although escherichia coli is capable of metabolizing a wide variety of substrates including hexoses and pentoses, its hexose metabolism is inferior to that of zymomonas mobilis, an obligate, ethanologenic bacterium. we therefore inserted and expressed z. mobilis genes encoding essential enzymes involved in the fermentation pathway, alcohol dehydrogenase ii (adh ii) and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc), into e. coli, resulting in increased cell growth and ethanol production. ethanol concentrations of >30 g/l were obtained on 10% glucose. additionally, since pyruvate is mainly assimilated through pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) and forms formic acid and acetyl coenzyme a, metabolic redirection was attempted through gene knockout by red-mediated recombination to decrease the byproducts of pyruvate metabolism. under microaerobic conditions, pfla- and pflb-mutants produced more ethanol (163% and 207%, respectively) relative to the parent strain, using glucose as a carbon  source.

TI  == an in vivo, label-free quick assay for xylose transport in escherichia coli.
AB  == efficient use of xylose is necessary for economic production of biochemicals and  biofuels from lignocellulosic materials. current studies on xylose uptake for various microorganisms have been hampered by the lack of a facile assay for xylose transport. in this work, a rapid in vivo, label-free method for measuring  xylose transport in escherichia coli was developed by taking advantage of the bacillus pumilus xylosidase (xynb), which cleaved a commercially available xylose analog, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx), to release a chromogenic group, p-nitrophenol (pnp). xynb was expressed alone or in conjunction with a zymomonas mobilis glucose facilitator protein (glf) capable of transporting xylose. this xynb-mediated transport assay was demonstrated in test tubes and 96-well plates with submicromolar concentrations of pnpx. kinetic inhibition experiments validated that pnpx and xylose were competitive substrates for the transport process, and the addition of glucose (20 g/l) in the culture medium clearly diminished the transmembrane transport of pnpx and, thus, mimicked its inhibitory action on xylose uptake. this method should be useful for engineering  of the xylose transport process in e. coli, and similar assay schemes can be extended to other microorganisms.

TI  == different biochemical mechanisms ensure network-wide balancing of reducing equivalents in microbial metabolism.
AB  == to sustain growth, the catabolic formation of the redox equivalent nadph must be  balanced with the anabolic demand. the mechanisms that ensure such network-wide balancing, however, are presently not understood. based on 13c-detected intracellular fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and cofactor specificities for all relevant central metabolic enzymes, we have quantified catabolic nadph production in agrobacterium tumefaciens, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, paracoccus versutus, pseudomonas fluorescens, rhodobacter sphaeroides, sinorhizobium meliloti, and zymomonas mobilis. for six species, the estimated nadph production from glucose catabolism exceeded the requirements for biomass synthesis. exceptions were p. fluorescens, with balanced rates, and e. coli, with insufficient catabolic production, in which about one-third of the nadph is supplied via the membrane-bound transhydrogenase pntab. p. versutus and b. subtilis were the only species that appear to rely on transhydrogenases for balancing nadph overproduction during growth on glucose. in the other four species, the main but not exclusive redox-balancing mechanism appears to be the dual cofactor specificities of several catabolic enzymes and/or the existence of  isoenzymes with distinct cofactor specificities, in particular glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. an unexpected key finding for all species, except e. coli and b. subtilis, was the lack of cofactor specificity in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, which contrasts with the textbook view of the pentose  phosphate pathway dehydrogenases as being nadp+ dependent.

AB  == levan is a homopolymer of fructose which can be produced by the transfructosylation reaction of levansucrase (ec 2.4.1.10) from sucrose. in particular, levan synthesized by zymomonas mobilis has found a wide and potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industry. in this study, the immobilization of z. mobilis levansucrae (encoded by levu) was attempted for repeated production of levan. by fusion levu with the chitin-binding domain (chbd), the hybrid protein was overproduced in a soluble form in escherichia coli. after direct absorption of the protein mixture from e. coli onto chitin beads, levansucrase tagged with chbd was found to specifically attach to the affinity matrix. subsequent analysis indicated that the linkage between the enzyme and chitin beads was substantially stable. furthermore, with 20% sucrose,  the production of levan was enhanced by 60% to reach 83 g/l using the immobilized levansucrase as compared to that by the free counterpart. this production yield accounts for 41.5% conversion yield (g/g) on the basis of sucrose. after all, a total production of levan with 480 g/l was obtained by recycling of the immobilized enzyme for seven times. it is apparent that this approach offers a promising way for levan production by z. mobilis levansucrase immobilized on chitin beads.

AB  == background: a metabolic regulation study was performed, based upon measurements of enzymatic activities, fermentation performance, and rt-pcr analysis of pathways related to central carbon metabolism, in an ethanologenic escherichia coli strain (cce14) derived from lineage c. in comparison with previous engineered strains, this e coli derivative has a higher ethanol production rate in mineral medium, as a result of the elevated heterologous expression of the chromosomally integrated genes encoding pdczm and adhzm (pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis). it is suggested that this behavior might be due to lineage differences between e. coli w and c. results: this study demonstrated that the glycolytic flux is controlled, in this case, by  reactions outside glycolysis, i.e., the fermentative pathways. changes in ethanol production rate in this ethanologenic strain result in low organic acid production rates, and high glycolytic and ethanologenic fluxes, that correlate with enhanced transcription and enzymatic activity levels of pdczm and adhzm. furthermore, a higher ethanol yield (90% of the theoretical) in glucose-mineral media was obtained with cce14 in comparison with previous engineered e. coli strains, such as ko11, that produces a 70% yield under the same conditions. conclusion: results suggest that a higher ethanol formation rate, caused by ahigher pdczm and adhzm activities induces a metabolic state that cells compensate through enhanced glucose transport, atp synthesis, and nad-nadh+h turnover rates. these results show that glycolytic enzymatic activities, present  in e. coli w and c under fermentative conditions, are sufficient to contend with  increases in glucose consumption and product formation rates.

AB  == squalene synthase (sqs) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the condensation  of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (fpp) to give presqualene diphosphate (pspp) and the subsequent rearrangement of pspp to squalene. these reactions constitute the first pathway-specific steps in hopane biosynthesis in bacteria and sterol biosynthesis in eukarya. the genes encoding sqs were isolated from the hopane-producing bacteria thermosynechococcus elongatus bp-1, bradyrhizobium japonicum, and zymomonas mobilis and cloned into an escherichia coli expression system. the expressed proteins with a his(6) tag were found exclusively in inclusion bodies when no additives were used in the buffer. after extensive optimization, soluble recombinant t. elongatus bp-1 sqs was obtained when cells were disrupted and purified in buffers containing glycerol. the recombinant b. japonicum and z. mobilis sqss could not be solubilized under any of the expression and purification conditions used. purified t. elongatus his(6)-sqs gave a single band at 42 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular ion at m/z 41886 by electrospray mass spectrometry. incubation with fpp and nadph gave squalene as the sole product. incubation of the enzyme with [(14)c]fpp in the absence of nadph gave pspp. the enzyme requires mg(2+) for activity, has an optimum ph of 7.6, and is strongly stimulated by detergent. under optimal conditions, the k(m) of fpp is 0.97 +/- 0.10 microm and  the k(cat) is 1.74 +/- 0.04 s(-1). zaragozic acid a, a potent inhibitor of mammalian, fungal, and saccharomyces cerevisiae sqss, also inhibited recombinant  t. elongatus bp-1 sqs, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 95.5 +/- 13.6 nm.

TI  == specific ethanol production rate in ethanologenic escherichia coli strain ko11 is limited by pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  == modification of ethanol productivity and yield, using mineral medium supplemented with glucose or xylose as carbon sources, was studied in ethanologenic escherichia coli ko11 by increasing the activity of five key carbon metabolism enzymes. ko11 efficiently converted glucose or xylose to ethanol with a yield close to 100% of the theoretical maximum when growing in rich medium. however, when ko11 ferments glucose or xylose in mineral medium, the ethanol yields decreased to only 70 and 60%, respectively. an increase in galp(ec) (permease of  galactose-glucose-xylose) or pgk(ec) (phosphoglycerate kinase) activities did not change xylose or glucose and ethanol flux. however, when pdc(zm) (pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis) activity was increased 7-fold, the yields of ethanol from glucose or xylose were increased to 85 and 75%, respectively, and organic acid formation rates were reduced. furthermore, as a response to a reduction in acetate and atp yield, and a limited pdc(zm) activity, an increase in pfk(ec) (phosphofructokinase) or pyk(bs) (pyruvate kinase from bacillus stearothermophilus) activity drastically reduced glucose or xylose consumption and ethanol formation flux. this experimental metabolic control analysis showed that ethanol flux in ko11 is negatively controlled by phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, and positively influenced by the pdc(zm) activity level.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for l-tyrosine production by expression of genes coding for the chorismate mutase domain of the native chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase and a cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from zymomonas  mobilis.
AB  == the expression of the feedback inhibition-insensitive enzyme cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase (tyrc) from zymomonas mobilis and the chorismate mutase domain from native chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase (phea(cm)) from escherichia coli  was compared to the expression of native feedback inhibition-sensitive chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase (cm-tyra(p)) with regard to the capacity to produce l-tyrosine in e. coli strains modified to increase the carbon flow to chorismate. shake flask experiments showed that tyrc increased the yield of l-tyrosine from glucose (y(l-tyr/glc)) by 6.8-fold compared to the yield obtained with cm-tyra(p). in bioreactor experiments, a strain expressing both tyrc and phea(cm) produced 3 g/liter of l-tyrosine with a y(l-tyr/glc) of 66 mg/g. these values are 46 and 48% higher than the values for a strain expressing only tyrc. the results show that the feedback inhibition-insensitive enzymes can be employed for strain development as part of a metabolic engineering strategy for l-tyrosine production.

TI  == analysis of the respiratory chain in ethanologenic zymomonas mobilis with a cyanide-resistant bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase and its  possible physiological roles.
AB  == the respiratory chain of the ethanologenic bacterium zymomonas mobilis was investigated, in which the pyruvate-to-ethanol pathway has been demonstrated to be mainly responsible for nadh oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is incomplete. membranes from cells cultivated under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions showed dehydrogenase and oxidase activities for nadh, d-lactate and d-glucose and ubiquinol oxidase activity. intriguingly, the nadh oxidase activity level of membrane fractions from cells grown aerobically was found to be higher than that of membrane fractions from escherichia coli or pseudomonas putida grown aerobically, indicating a crucial role of the respiratory chain in nadh oxidation in the organism. cyanide-resistant terminal oxidase activity was observed and appeared to be due to a bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase encoded by the entire genome. the terminal oxidase with a relatively strong ubiquinol oxidase activity exhibited remarkably weak signals of cytochrome d. considering these findings and the presence of a type-ii nadh dehydrogenase but not a type-i, a simple respiratory chain that generates less energymay have evolved in z. mobilis.

TI  == metabolic engineering of bacillus subtilis for ethanol production: lactate dehydrogenase plays a key role in fermentative metabolism.
AB  == wild-type bacillus subtilis ferments 20 g/liter glucose in 48 h, producing lactate and butanediol, but not ethanol or acetate. to construct an ethanologenic b. subtilis strain, homologous recombination was used to disrupt the native lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) gene (ldh) by chromosomal insertion of the zymomonas  mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase ii gene (adhb) under the control of the ldh native promoter. the values of the intracellular pdc and adhii enzymatic activities of the engineered b. subtilis bs35 strain were similar to those found in an ethanologenic escherichia coli strain. bs35 produced ethanol and butanediol; however, the cell growth and glucose consumption rates were reduced by 70 and 65%, respectively, in comparison to those in the progenitor strain. to eliminate butanediol production, the acetolactate synthase gene (alss) was inactivated. in the bs36 strain (bs35 delta alss), ethanol production was enhanced, with a high yield (89% of the theoretical); however, the cell growth and glucose consumption rates remained low. interestingly, kinetic characterization of ldh from b. subtilis showed that  it is able to oxidize nadh and nadph. the expression of the transhydrogenase encoded by udha from e. coli allowed a partial recovery of the cell growth rate and an early onset of ethanol production. beyond pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and nadh oxidation, an additional key physiological role of ldh for glucose consumption under fermentative conditions is suggested. long-term cultivation showed that 8.9 g/liter of ethanol can be obtained using strain bs37 (bs35 delta  alss udha+). as far as we know, this is the highest ethanol titer and yield reported with a b. subtilis strain.

AB  == its metabolic characteristics suggest that zymobacter palmae gen. nov., sp. nov.  could serve as a useful new ethanol-fermenting bacterium, but its biotechnological exploitation will require certain genetic modifications. we therefore engineered z. palmae so as to broaden the range of its fermentable sugar substrates to include the pentose sugar xylose. the escherichia coli genes  encoding the xylose catabolic enzymes xylose isomerase, xylulokinase, transaldolase, and transketolase were introduced into z. palmae, where their expression was driven by the zymomonas mobilis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. when cultured with 40 g/liter xylose, the recombinant z.  palmae strain was able to ferment 16.4 g/liter xylose within 5 days, producing 91% of the theoretical yield of ethanol with no accumulation of organic acids as  metabolic by-products. notably, xylose acclimation enhanced both the expression of xylose catabolic enzymes and the rate of xylose uptake into recombinant z. palmae, which enabled the acclimated organism to completely and simultaneously ferment a mixture of 40 g/liter glucose and 40 g/liter xylose within 8 h, producing 95% of the theoretical yield of ethanol. thus, efficient fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose to ethanol can be accomplished by using z. palmae expressing e. coli xylose catabolic enzymes.

AB  == with the 21 century's coming, the era of cheap oil is coming to the end. there has been an increasing worldwide interest in fuel ethanol. in the last two decades, lots of work has been done to develop strains for ethanol producing. research progress on metabolic engineering of strains for fuel ethanol production is summarized, including genetically engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae to utilize starch, pentose and cellulose, zymomonas mobilis to ferment arabinose and xylose, escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca to introduce heterogenous ethanol production pathway. the aim of engineering these strains is to obtain an ideal microorganism which can converse the available carbon sources to ethanol rapidly  and efficiently with high tolerance to ethanol and to inhibitory components in the cheap materials such as lignocellulose hydrolysate. the importance of fuel ethanol will be a stimulus to develop engineered hardy strains to utilize cheap materials for high ethanol concentration production. since both saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymomonas mobilis are generally regarded as safe (gras), genetically engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae which can utilize raw starch directly and recombinant zymomonas mobilis which can ferment glucose, arabinose and xylose in the lignocellulose hydrolysate have potential application to industry in the near future.

TI  == microdiesel: escherichia coli engineered for fuel production.
AB  == biodiesel is an alternative energy source and a substitute for petroleum-based diesel fuel. it is produced from renewable biomass by transesterification of triacylglycerols from plant oils, yielding monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids with short-chain alcohols such as fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters (faees). despite numerous environmental benefits, a broader use of biodiesel is hampered by the extensive acreage required for sufficient production of oilseed crops. therefore, processes are urgently needed to enable biodiesel production from more readily available bulk plant materials like sugars or cellulose. toward this goal, the authors established biosynthesis of biodiesel-adequate faees, referred to as microdiesel, in metabolically engineered escherichia coli. this was achieved by heterologous expression in e. coli of the  zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase and the unspecific acyltransferase from acinetobacter baylyi strain adp1. by this approach, ethanol formation was combined with subsequent esterification of the ethanol with the acyl moieties of coenzyme a thioesters of fatty acids if the cells were cultivated under aerobic conditions in the presence of glucose and oleic acid. ethyl oleate was the major constituent of these faees, with minor amounts of ethyl palmitate and ethyl palmitoleate. faee concentrations of 1.28 g  l(-1) and a faee content of the cells of 26 % of the cellular dry mass were achieved by fed-batch fermentation using renewable carbon sources. this novel approach might pave the way for industrial production of biodiesel equivalents from renewable resources by employing engineered micro-organisms, enabling a broader use of biodiesel-like fuels in the future.

TI  == the role of aspartic acid 143 in e. coli trna-guanine transglycosylase: insights  from mutagenesis studies and computational modeling.
AB  == trna guanine transglycosylase (tgt) is a trna-modifying enzyme which catalyzes the posttranscriptional exchange of guanine in position 34 of trna(y,h,n,d) with  the modified base queuine in eukaryotes or its precursor, preq(1) base, in eubacteria. thus, tgt must recognize the guanine in trna and the free base queuine or preq(1) to catalyze this exchange. the crystal structure of zymomonas  mobilis tgt with preq(1) bound suggests that a key aspartate is critically involved in substrate recognition. to explore this, a series of site-directed mutants of d143 in escherichia coli tgt were made and characterized to investigate heterocyclic substrate recognition. our data confirm that d143 has significant impact on k(m) of guanine; however, the trend in the k(m) data (d143a < d143n < d143s < d143t) is unexpected. computational studies were used to further elucidate the interactions between guanine and the d143 mutants. a homology model of e. coli tgt was created, and the role of d143 was investigated  by molecular dynamic simulations of guanine bound to the wild-type and d143-mutant tgts. to validate the model systems against our kinetic data, free energies of binding were fit using the linear interaction energy (lie) method. this is a unique application of the lie method because the same ligand is bound to several mutant proteins rather than one protein binding several ligands. the atomic detail gained from the simulations provided a better understanding of the  binding affinities of guanine with the mutant tgts, revealing that water molecules enter the active site and hydrogen bond to the ligand and compensate for lost protein-ligand interactions. the trend of binding affinity for wild-type > d143a > d143n > d143s > d143t appears to be directly related to the degree of hydrogen bonding available to guanine in the binding site.

AB  == the structurally conserved and ubiquitous pathways of central carbon metabolism provide building blocks and cofactors for the biosynthesis of cellular macromolecules. the relative uses of pathways and reactions, however, vary widely among species and depend upon conditions, and some are not used at all. here we identify the network topology of glucose metabolism and its in vivo operation by  quantification of intracellular carbon fluxes from 13c tracer experiments. specifically, we investigated agrobacterium tumefaciens, two pseudomonads, sinorhizobium meliloti, rhodobacter sphaeroides, zymomonas mobilis, and paracoccus versutus, which grow on glucose as the sole carbon source, represent fundamentally different metabolic lifestyles (aerobic, anaerobic, photoheterotrophic, and chemoheterotrophic), and are phylogenetically distinct (firmicutes, gamma-proteobacteria, and alpha-proteobacteria). compared to those of the model bacteria escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, metabolisms of the  investigated species differed significantly in several respects: (i) the entner-doudoroff pathway was the almost exclusive catabolic route; (ii) the pentose phosphate pathway exhibited exclusively biosynthetic functions, in many cases also requiring flux through the nonoxidative branch; (iii) all aerobes exhibited fully respiratory metabolism without significant overflow metabolism; and (iv) all aerobes used the pyruvate bypass of the malate dehydrogenase reaction to a significant extent. exclusively, pseudomonas fluorescens converted  most glucose extracellularly to gluconate and 2-ketogluconate. overall, the results suggest that metabolic data from model species with extensive industrial  and laboratory history are not representative of microbial metabolism, at least not quantitatively.

AB  == a whole-cell biotransformation system for the conversion of d-fructose to d-mannitol was developed in escherichia coli by construction of a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. first, the mdh gene encoding for the mannitol dehydrogenase of leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides atcc 12291 (mdh) was expressed,  effecting a strong catalytic activity of a nadh-dependent reduction of d-fructose to d-mannitol in cell extracts of the recombinant e. coli strain but not enabling whole cells of the strain to produce d-mannitol from d-fructose. to provide a source for reduction equivalents needed for d-fructose reduction, the fdh gene from mycobacterium vaccae n10 (fdh) encoding formate dehydrogenase was functionally co-expressed. fdh generates nadh used for d-fructose reduction by dehydrogenation of formate to carbon dioxide. these recombinant e. coli cells were able to form d-mannitol from d-fructose in a low but significant quantity (15 mm). the introduction of a further gene, encoding for the glucose facilitator protein of zymomonas mobilis (glf) enabled the cells to efficiently take up d-fructose into the cells, without simultaneous phosphorylation. resting cells of this e. coli strain (3 g cell dry weight/l) produced 216 mm d-mannitol in 17 hours. biotransformations conducted under ph-control by formic acid addition yielded d-mannitol at a concentration of 362 mm within 8 hours. the yield y(d-mannitol d-fructose) was 84 [mol%]. these results show that the recombinant strain of e. coli can be utilized as an efficient biocatalyst for d-mannitol formation.

TI  == inhibition of thiamin diphosphate dependent enzymes by 3-deazathiamin diphosphate.
AB  == 3-deazathiamin diphosphate (deazatpp) and a second thiamin diphosphate (tpp) analogue having a benzene ring in place of the thiazolium ring have been synthesised. these compounds are both extremely potent inhibitors of pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis; binding is competitive with tpp and is essentially irreversible even though no covalent linkage is formed. deazatpp binds approximately seven-fold faster than tpp and at least 25,000-fold more tightly (k(i) less than 14 pm). deazatpp is also a potent inhibitor of the e1 subunit of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase from e. coli and binds more than 70-fold faster than tpp. in this case slow reversal of the inhibition could be observed and a k(i) value of about 5 nm was calculated (ca. 500-fold tighter binding than tpp).

TI  == crystal structure of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase from zymomonas mobilis at 1.9-a resolution.
AB  == 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (dxr) is the second enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. the structure of the apo-form  of this enzyme from zymomonas mobilis has been solved and refined to 1.9-a resolution, and that of a binary complex with the co-substrate nadph to 2.7-a resolution. the subunit of dxr consists of three domains. residues 1-150 form the nadph binding domain, which is a variant of the typical dinucleotide-binding fold. the second domain comprises a four-stranded mixed beta-sheet, with three helices flanking the sheet. most of the putative active site residues are located on this domain. the c-terminal domain (residues 300-386) folds into a four-helix  bundle. in solution and in the crystal, the enzyme forms a homo-dimer. the interface between the two monomers is formed predominantly by extension of the sheet in the second domain. the adenosine phosphate moiety of nadph binds to the  nucleotide-binding fold in the canonical way. the adenine ring interacts with the loop after beta1 and with the loops between alpha2 and beta2 and alpha5 and beta5. the nicotinamide ring is disordered in crystals of this binary complex. comparisons to escherichia coli dxr show that the two enzymes are very similar in structure, and that the active site architecture is highly conserved. however, there are differences in the recognition of the adenine ring of nadph in the two  enzymes.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli: construction of an efficient biocatalyst for d-mannitol formation in a whole-cell biotransformation.
AB  == a whole-cell biotransformation system for the conversion of d-fructose to d-mannitol was developed in escherichia coli by constructing a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. first, the mdh gene, encoding mannitol dehydrogenase of leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides atcc 12291 (mdh), was expressed, effecting strong catalytic activity of an nadh-dependent reduction of d-fructose to d-mannitol in cell extracts of the recombinant e. coli strain. by contrast whole  cells of the strain were unable to produce d-mannitol from d-fructose. to provide a source of reduction equivalents needed for d-fructose reduction, the fdh gene from mycobacterium vaccae n10 (fdh), encoding formate dehydrogenase, was functionally co-expressed. fdh generates the nadh used for d-fructose reduction by dehydrogenation of formate to carbon dioxide. these recombinant e. coli cells  were able to form d-mannitol from d-fructose in a low but significant quantity (15 mm). the introduction of a further gene, encoding the glucose facilitator protein of zymomonas mobilis (glf), allowed the cells to efficiently take up d-fructose, without simultaneous phosphorylation. resting cells of this e. coli strain (3 g cell dry weight/l) produced 216 mm d-mannitol in 17 h. due to equimolar formation of sodium hydroxide during nad(+)-dependent oxidation of sodium formate to carbon dioxide, the ph value of the buffered biotransformation  system increased by one ph unit within 2 h. biotransformations conducted under ph control by formic-acid addition yielded d-mannitol at a concentration of 362 mm within 8 h. the yield y(d-mannitol/d-fructose) was 84 mol%. these results show that the recombinant strain of e. coli can be utilized as an efficient biocatalyst for d-mannitol formation.

TI  == serine substitution for cysteine residues in levansucrase selectively abolishes levan forming activity.
AB  == levansucrase is responsible for levan formation during sucrose fermentation of zymomonas mobilis, and this decreases the efficiency of ethanol production. as thiol modifying agents decrease levan formation, a role for cysteine residues in  levansucrase activity has been examined using derivatives of z. mobilis levansucrase that carry serine substitutions of cysteine at positions 121, 151 or 244. these substitutions abolished the levan forming activity of levansucrase whilst only halving its activity in sucrose hydrolysis. thus, polymerase and hydrolase activities of z. mobilis levansucrase are separate and have different requirements for the enzyme's cysteine residues.

TI  == flexible adaptations in the structure of the trna-modifying enzyme trna-guanine transglycosylase and their implications for substrate selectivity, reaction mechanism and structure-based drug design.
AB  == the enzyme trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt, ec 2.4.2.29) catalyses a base-exchange reaction that leads to anticodon modifications of certain trnas. the tgt enzymes of the eubacteria zymomonas mobilis (z. mobilis tgt) and escherichia coli (e. coli tgt) show a different behaviour in the presence of competitive inhibitors. the active sites of both enzymes are identical apart from a single conservative amino acid exchange, namely tyr106 of z. mobilis tgt is replaced by a phe in e. coli tgt. although tyr106 is, in contrast to phe106, hydrogen bonded in the ligand-free structure, we can show by a mutational study of tgt(y106f) that this is not the reason for the different responses upon competition. the tgt enzymes of various species differ in their substrate selectivity. depending on the applied ph conditions and/or induced by ligand binding, a peptide-bond flip modulates the recognition properties of the substrate binding site, which changes between donor and acceptor functionality. furthermore interstitial water molecules play an important role in these adaptations of the pocket. the flip of the peptide bond is further stabilised by  a glutamate residue that operates as general acid/base. an active-site aspartate  residue, presumed to operate as a nucleophile through covalent bonding during the base-exchange reaction, shows different conformations depending on the nature of  the bound ligand. the induced-fit adaptations observed in the various tgt complex structures by multiple crystal-structure analyses are in agreement with the functional properties of the enzyme. in consequence, full understanding of this plasticity can be exploited for drug design.

TI  == bacteria engineered for fuel ethanol production: current status.
AB  == the lack of industrially suitable microorganisms for converting biomass into fuel ethanol has traditionally been cited as a major technical roadblock to developing a bioethanol industry. in the last two decades, numerous microorganisms have been engineered to selectively produce ethanol. lignocellulosic biomass contains complex carbohydrates that necessitate utilizing microorganisms capable of fermenting sugars not fermentable by brewers' yeast. the most significant of these is xylose. the greatest successes have been in the engineering of gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, and zymomonas mobilis. e. coli and k. oxytoca are naturally able to use a wide spectrum of sugars, and work has concentrated on engineering these strains to selectively produce ethanol. z. mobilis produces ethanol at high yields, but ferments only glucose and fructose. work on this organism has concentrated on introducing pathways for the fermentation of arabinose and xylose. the history of constructing these strains and current progress in refining them are detailed in  this review.

AB  == prokaryotic trna guanine transglycosylase (tgt) catalyzes replacement of guanine  (g) by 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preq1) at the wobble position of four specific trnas. addition of 9-deazaguanine (9dzg) to a reaction mixture of zymomonas mobilis tgt and an rna substrate allowed us to trap, purify and crystallize a chemically competent covalent intermediate of the tgt-catalyzed reaction. the crystal structure of the tgt-rna-9dzg ternary complex at a resolution of 2.9 a reveals, unexpectedly, that rna is tethered to tgt through the side chain of asp280. thus, asp280, instead of the previously proposed asp102, acts as the nucleophile for the reaction. the rna substrate adopts an unusual conformation, with four out of seven nucleotides in the loop region flipped out. interactions between tgt and rna revealed by the structure provide the molecular basis of the rna substrate requirements by tgt. furthermore, reaction of preq1 with the crystallized covalent intermediate provides insight into the necessary structural changes required for the tgt-catalyzed reaction to  occur.

TI  == an essential role for aspartate 264 in catalysis by trna-guanine transglycosylase from escherichia coli.
AB  == trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt) catalyzes a post-transcriptional base-exchange reaction involved in the incorporation of the modified base queuine (q) into the wobble position of certain trnas. catalysis by tgt occurs through a  double-displacement mechanism that involves the formation of a covalent enzyme-rna intermediate (kittendorf, j. d., barcomb, l. m., nonekowski, s. t., and garcia, g. a. (2001) biochemistry 40, 14123-14133). the tgt chemical mechanism requires the protonation of the displaced guanine and the deprotonation of the incoming heterocyclic base. based on its position in the active site, it is likely that aspartate 264 is involved in these proton transfer events. to investigate this possibility, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to convert aspartate 264 to alanine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, lysine, and histidine. biochemical characterization of these tgt mutants revealed that only the conservative glutamate mutant retained catalytic activity, with km values for both trna and guanine 3-fold greater than those for wild-type, whereas the kcat was depressed by an order of magnitude. furthermore, of these six tgt mutants, only the tgt(d264e) was capable of forming a tgt.rna covalent intermediate; however, unlike wild-type tgt, only hydroxylamine is capable of cleaving the tgt(d264e).rna covalent complex. in an effort to better understand the unique biochemical properties of the d264e tgt mutant, we solved the crystal structure of the zymomonas mobilis tgt with the analogous mutation (d280e). the results of  these studies support two roles for aspartate 264 in catalysis by tgt, protonation of the leaving guanine and deprotonation of the incoming preq1.

TI  == expression of galp and glk in a escherichia coli pts mutant restores glucose transport and increases glycolytic flux to fermentation products.
AB  == in escherichia coli, the uptake and phosphorylation of glucose is carried out mainly by the phosphotransferase system (pts). despite the efficiency of glucose  transport by pts, the required consumption of 1 mol of phosphoenolpyruvate (pep)  for each mol of internalized glucose represents a drawback for some biotechnological applications where pep is a precursor of the desired product. for this reason, there is considerable interest in the generation of strains that can transport glucose efficiently by a non-pts mechanism. the purpose of this work was to study the effect of different gene expression levels, of galactose permease (galp) and glucokinase (glk), on glucose internalization and phosphorylation in a e. coli pts(-) strain. the w3110 pts(-), designated vh32, showed limited growth on glucose with a specific growth rate (mu) of 0.03 h(-1).  a low copy plasmid family was constructed containing e. coli galp and glk genes,  individually or combined, under the control of a trc-derived promoter set. this plasmid family was used to transform the vh32 strain, each plasmid having different levels of expression of galp and glk. experiments in minimal medium with glucose showed that expression of only galp under the control of a wild-type trc promoter resulted in a mu of 0.55 h(-1), corresponding to 89% of the mu measured for w3110 (0.62 h(-1)). in contrast, no increase in specific growth rate (mu) was observed in vh32 with a plasmid expressing only glk from the same promoter. strains transformed with part of the plasmid family, containing both galp and glk genes, showed a mu value similar to that of w3110. fermentor experiments with the vh32 strain harboring plasmids pv1glk1galp, pv4glk5galp, and pv5glk5galp showed that specific acetate productivity was twofold higher than in  w3110. introduction of plasmid ploi1594, coding for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis, to strain vh32 carrying one of the  plasmids with galp and glk caused a twofold increase in ethanol productivity over strain w3110, also containing ploi1594.

AB  == the thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase catalyses the formation of indoleacetaldehyde from indolepyruvate, one step in the indolepyruvate pathway of biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid. the crystal structure of this enzyme from enterobacter cloacae has been determined at 2.65 a resolution and refined to a crystallographic r-factor of 20.5% (rfree 23.6%). the subunit of indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains three domains of open alpha/beta topology, which are similar in structure to that of pyruvate decarboxylase. the tetramer has pseudo 222 symmetry and can be described as a dimer of dimers. it resembles the tetramer of pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis, but with a relative difference of 20 degrees in the angle between the two dimers. active site residues are highly conserved in indolepyruvate/pyruvate decarboxylase, suggesting that the interactions with the  cofactor thiamin diphosphate and the catalytic mechanisms are very similar. the substrate binding site in indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains a large hydrophobic pocket which can accommodate the bulky indole moiety of the substrate. in pyruvate decarboxylases this pocket is smaller in size and allows discrimination of larger vs. smaller substrates. in most pyruvate decarboxylases, restriction of cavity size is due to replacement of residues at three positions by large, hydrophobic amino acids such as tyrosine or tryptophan.

TI  == engineering lactic acid bacteria with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes for ethanol production from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are candidates for engineered production of ethanol from biomass because they are food-grade microorganisms that can, in many cases, metabolize a variety of sugars and grow under harsh conditions. in an effort to divert fermentation from production of lactic acid to ethanol, plasmids were constructed to express pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), encoded by the pdc and adhb genes of zymomonas mobilis, in lactic acid bacteria. several strains were transformed with the plasmids, and transcription of pdc and adhb was confirmed by northern hybridization analysis of transformants. pdc and adh enzyme activities were at least 5- to 10-fold lower in these bacteria compared to escherichia coli transformed with the same plasmid. glucose fermentations were carried out, and some, but not all, of the transformed strains produced more ethanol than the untransformed parent strains. however, lactic acid was the primary fermentation product formed by all of the transformants, indicating that adh and pdc activities were insufficient to divert significant carbon flow towards ethanol.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the zymobacter palmae pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc) and comparison to bacterial homologues.
AB  == pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) is the key enzyme in all homo-ethanol fermentations. although widely distributed among plants, yeasts, and fungi, pdc is absent in animals and rare in bacteria (established for only three organisms). genes encoding the three known bacterial pdc genes have been previously described and expressed as active recombinant proteins. the pdc gene from zymomonas mobilis has been used to engineer ethanol-producing biocatalysts for use in industry. in this paper, we describe a new bacterial pdc gene from zymobacter palmae. the pattern of codon usage for this gene appears quite similar to that for escherichia coli genes. in e. coli recombinants, the z. palmae pdc represented approximately 1/3 of the soluble protein. biochemical and kinetic properties of the z. palmae enzyme were compared to purified pdcs from three other bacteria. of the four bacterial pdcs, the z. palmae enzyme exhibited the highest specific activity (130 u mg of protein(-1)) and the lowest km for pyruvate (0.24 mm). differences in biochemical properties, thermal stability, and codon usage may offer unique advantages for the development of new biocatalysts for fuel ethanol production.

TI  == performance testing of zymomonas mobilis metabolically engineered for cofermentation of glucose, xylose, and arabinose.
AB  == iogen corporation of ottawa, canada, has recently built a 40t/d biomass-to-ethanol demonstration plant adjacent to its enzyme production facility. it has partnered with the university of toronto to test the c6/c5 cofermenta-tion performance characteristics of the national renewable energy labora-tory's metabolically engineered zymomonas mobilis using various biomass hydrolysates. iogen's feedstocks are primarily agricultural wastes such as corn stover and wheat straw. integrated recombinant z. mobilis strain ax101 grows on d-xylose and/or l-arabinose as the sole carbon/energy sources and ferments these  pentose sugars to ethanol in high yield. strain ax101 lacks the tetracycline resistance gene that was a common feature of other recombinant zm constructs. genomic integration provides reliable cofermentation performance in the absence of antibiotics, another characteristic making strain ax101 attractive for industrial cellulosic ethanol production. in this work, iogen's biomass hydrolysate was simulated by a pure sugar medium containing 6% (w/v) glucose, 3%  xylose, and 0.35% arabinose. at a level of 3 g/l (dry solids), corn steep liquor  with inorganic nitrogen (0.8 g/l of ammonium chloride or 1.2 g/l of diammonium phosphate) was a cost-effective nutritional supplement. in the absence of acetic  acid, the maximum volumetric ethanol productivity of a continuous fermentation at ph 5.0 was 3.54 g/l x h. during prolonged continuous fermentation, the efficiency of sugar-to-ethanol conversion (based on total sugar load) was maintained at >85%. at a level of 0.25% (w/v) acetic acid, the productivity decreased to 1.17 g/l x h at ph 5.5. unlike integrated, xylose-utilizing rec zm strain c25, strain  ax101 produces less lactic acid as byproduct, owing to the fact that the escherichia coli arabinose genes are inserted into a region of the host chromosome tentatively assigned to the gene for d-lactic acid dehydrogenase. in ph-controlled batch fermentations with sugar mixtures, the order of sugar exhaustion from the medium was glucose followed by xylose and arabinose. both the total sugar load and the sugar ratio were shown to be important determinants for  efficient cofermentation. ethanol at a level of 3% (w/v) was implicated as both inhibitory to pentose fermentation and as a potentiator of acetic acid inhibition of pentose fermentation at ph 5.5. the effect of ethanol may have been underestimated in other assessments of acetic acid sensitivity. this work underscores the importance of employing similar assay conditions in making comparative assessments of biocatalyst fermentation performance.

TI  == flux through citrate synthase limits the growth of ethanologenic escherichia coli ko11 during xylose fermentation.
AB  == previous studies have shown that high levels of complex nutrients (luria broth or 5% corn steep liquor) were necessary for rapid ethanol production by the ethanologenic strain escherichia coli ko11. although this strain is prototrophic, cell density and ethanol production remained low in mineral salts media (10% xylose) unless complex nutrients were added. the basis for this nutrient requirement was identified as a regulatory problem created by metabolic engineering of an ethanol pathway. cells must partition pyruvate between competing needs for biosynthesis and regeneration of nad(+). expression of low-k(m) zymomonas mobilis pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) in ko11 reduced the flow  of pyruvate carbon into native fermentation pathways as desired, but it also restricted the flow of carbon skeletons into the 2-ketoglutarate arm of the tricarboxylic acid pathway (biosynthesis). in mineral salts medium containing 1%  corn steep liquor and 10% xylose, the detrimental effect of metabolic engineering was substantially reduced by addition of pyruvate. a similar benefit was also observed when acetaldehyde, 2-ketoglutarate, or glutamate was added. in e. coli,  citrate synthase links the cellular abundance of nadh to the supply of 2-ketoglutarate for glutamate biosynthesis. this enzyme is allosterically regulated and inhibited by high nadh concentrations. in addition, citrate synthase catalyzes the first committed step in 2-ketoglutarate synthesis. oxidation of nadh by added acetaldehyde (or pyruvate) would be expected to increase the activity of e. coli citrate synthase and direct more carbon into 2-ketoglutarate, and this may explain the stimulation of growth. this hypothesis  was tested, in part, by cloning the bacillus subtilis citz gene encoding an nadh-insensitive citrate synthase. expression of recombinant citz in ko11 was accompanied by increases in cell growth and ethanol production, which substantially reduced the need for complex nutrients.

AB  == acetobacter pasteurianus, an obligately oxidative bacterium, is the first organism shown to utilize pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) as a central enzyme for oxidative metabolism. in plants, yeast, and other bacteria, pdc functions solely  as part of the fermentative ethanol pathway. during the growth of a. pasteurianus on lactic acid, the central intermediate pyruvate is cleaved to acetaldehyde and  co(2) by pdc. acetaldehyde is subsequently oxidized to its final product, acetic  acid. the presence of the pdc enzyme in a. pasteurianus was confirmed by zymograms stained for acetaldehyde production, enzyme assays using alcohol dehydrogenase as the coupling enzyme, and by cloning and characterization of the  pdc operon. a. pasteurianus pdc was also expressed in recombinant escherichia coli. the level of pdc activity was regulated in response to growth substrate, highest with lactic acid and absent with mannitol. the translated pdc sequence (548 amino acids) was most similar to that of zymomonas mobilis, an obligately fermentative bacterium. a second operon ( alda) was also found which is transcribed divergently from pdc. this operon encodes a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase (ald2; 357 amino acids) related to class iii alcohol dehydrogenases and most similar to glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenases from alpha-proteobacteria and anabeana azollae.

TI  == trna-guanine transglycosylase from escherichia coli: molecular mechanism and role of aspartate 89.
AB  == the enzyme trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt, ec 2.4.2.29) catalyzes a posttranscriptional transglycosylation reaction involved in the incorporation of  the modified base queuine [q, 7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-ylaminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine] into trna. previously, the crystal structure of the tgt from zymomonas mobilis was solved in complex with preq(1) (the substrate for the eubacterial tgt) [romier et al. (1996) embo j. 15, 2850-2857]. an aspartate residue at position 102 (position 89  in the escherichia coli tgt) was proposed to play a nucleophilic role in an associative catalytic mechanism. although this is an attractive and precedented mechanism, a dissociative mechanism is equally plausible. in a dissociative mechanism, aspartate 89 would provide electrostatic stabilization of an oxocarbenium ion intermediate that is formed by dissociation of guanine. to clarify the nature of the catalytic mechanism of tgt, we have generated and characterized four mutations of aspartate 89 in the e. coli tgt (alanine, asparagine, cysteine, and glutamate). all four mutant tgts were able to noncovalently bind trna, but only the glutamate mutant was able to form a stable  complex with the rna substrate under denaturing conditions that was comparable to wild type. furthermore, the glutamate mutant was the only mutant tgt that demonstrated significant activity. kinetic parameters were determined for this enzyme and shown to be comparable to wild type, revealing that the enzyme is considerably tolerant of the positioning of the carboxylate. under conditions of  high enzyme concentrations and long time courses, the alanine, asparagine, and cysteine mutants showed very low levels (ca. 10(3)-fold lower than wild type) of  activity that were linear with respect to enzyme concentration and dependent upon ph in a fashion similar to that of the wild type. however, the observed initial velocities were too low to accurately determine k(cat) and k(m) values. we hypothesize that the activity observed for these mutants is most likely derived from host strain tgt (wt) contamination. these results are most consistent with aspartate 89 acting as a nucleophile in an associative catalytic mechanism.

TI  == the chryseobacterium meningosepticum pafa enzyme: prototype of a new enzyme family of prokaryotic phosphate-irrepressible alkaline phosphatases?
AB  == chryseobacterium meningosepticum is an aerobic gram-negative rod widely distributed in natural environments. unlike many bacteria, it produces a phosphate-irrepressible periplasmic alkaline phosphatase (ap). this work describes cloning of the gene encoding that enzyme from c. meningosepticum ccug 4310 (nctc 10585), and preliminary characterization of its product. the gene, named pafa, encodes a protein (pafa) of 546 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of the mature peptide of 58682 da. pafa exhibits high sequence identity with the phov ap of synechococcus pcc 7942 (49.9% identity) and with the cda ca(2+)-dependent atpase of myroides odoratus (51.9% identity), while being more distantly related to the phod ap of zymomonas mobilis (22.1% identity) and to the phoa ap of escherichia coli (14.0% identity). pafa was partially purified; it exhibits optimal activity at ph 8.5 and is active towards a broad spectrum of  substrates including both phosphomonoesters and atp, with preferential activity for the latter compound. the present findings allow definition of a new family of aps including 60 kda, periplasmic enzymes whose expression is not influenced by freely available p(i) in the medium. moreover, pafa can be considered an evolutionary intermediate between ca(2+)-atpase of m. odoratus and the aps phov of synechococcus pcc 7942 and phod of z. mobilis.

TI  == production of the gram-positive sarcina ventriculi pyruvate decarboxylase in escherichia coli.
AB  == sarcina ventriculi grows in a remarkable range of mesophilic environments from ph 2 to ph 10. during growth in acidic environments, where acetate is toxic, expression of pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) serves to direct the flow of pyruvate  into ethanol during fermentation. pdc is rare in bacteria and absent in animals,  although it is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. the pdc gene from s. ventriculi is the first to be cloned and characterized from a gram-positive bacterium. in escherichia coli, the recombinant pdc gene from s. ventriculi was poorly expressed due to differences in codon usage that are typical of low-g+c organisms. expression was improved by the addition of supplemental codon genes and this facilitated the 136-fold purification of the recombinant enzyme as a homo-tetramer of 58 kda subunits. unlike zymomonas mobilis pdc, which exhibits michaelis-menten kinetics, s. ventriculi pdc is activated by pyruvate and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics similar to fungal and higher plant pdcs. amino acid residues involved in the allosteric site for pyruvate in fungal pdcs were conserved in s. ventriculi pdc, consistent with a conservation of mechanism. cluster analysis of deduced amino acid sequences confirmed that s. ventriculi pdc is quite distant from z. mobilis pdc and plant pdcs. s. ventriculi pdc appears to have diverged very early from a common ancestor which included most fungal pdcs and eubacterial indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylases. these results suggest that the  s. ventriculi pdc gene is quite ancient in origin, in contrast to the z. mobilis  pdc, which may have originated by horizontal transfer from higher plants.

TI  == crystal structure of histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (hisc) from escherichia coli, and its covalent complex with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and l-histidinol phosphate.
AB  == the biosynthesis of histidine is a central metabolic process in organisms ranging from bacteria to yeast and plants. the seventh step in the synthesis of histidine within eubacteria is carried out by a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent l-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (hisc, ec 2.6.1.9). here, we report the crystal structure of l-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase from escherichia coli, as a complex with pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (pmp) at 1.5 a resolution, as the internal aldimine with plp, and in a covalent, tetrahedral complex consisting of plp and l-histidinol phosphate attached to lys214, both at 2.2 a resolution. this covalent complex resembles, in structural terms, the gem-diamine intermediate that is formed transiently during conversion of the internal to external aldimine.hisc is a dimeric enzyme with a mass of approximately 80 kda. like most plp-dependent enzymes, each hisc monomer consists of two domains, a larger plp-binding domain having an alpha/beta/alpha topology, and a smaller domain. an n-terminal arm contributes to the dimerization of the two monomers. the plp-binding domain of hisc shows weak sequence similarity, but significant structural similarity with the plp-binding domains of a number of plp-dependent enzymes. residues that interact with the plp cofactor, including tyr55, asn157, asp184, tyr187, ser213, lys214 and arg222, are conserved in the family of aspartate, tyrosine and histidinol phosphate aminotransferases. the imidazole ring of l-histidinol phosphate is bound, in part, through a hydrogen bond with tyr110, a residue that is substituted by phe in the broad substrate specific hisc enzymes from zymomonas mobilis and bacillus subtilis. comparison of the structures of the hisc internal aldimine, the pmp complex and the hisc l-histidinol phosphate complex reveal minimal changes in protein or ligand structure. proton transfer, required for conversion of the gem-diamine to the external aldimine, does not appear to be limited by the distance between substrate and lysine amino groups. we propose that the tetrahedral complex has resulted from non-productive binding of l-histidinol phosphate soaked into the hisc crystals, resulting in its inability to be converted to the external aldimine at the hisc active site.

TI  == fuel ethanol production from lignocellulose: a challenge for metabolic engineering and process integration.
AB  == with industrial development growing rapidly, there is a need for environmentally  sustainable energy sources. bioethanol (ethanol from biomass) is an attractive, sustainable energy source to fuel transportation. based on the premise that fuel  bioethanol can contribute to a cleaner environment and with the implementation of environmental protection laws in many countries, demand for this fuel is increasing. efficient ethanol production processes and cheap substrates are needed. current ethanol production processes using crops such as sugar cane and corn are well-established; however, utilization of a cheaper substrate such as lignocellulose could make bioethanol more competitive with fossil fuel. the processing and utilization of this substrate is complex, differing in many aspects from crop-based ethanol production. one important requirement is an efficient microorganism able to ferment a variety of sugars (pentoses, and hexoses) as well as to tolerate stress conditions. through metabolic engineering, bacterial and yeast strains have been constructed which feature traits that are advantageous for ethanol production using lignocellulose sugars. after several rounds of modification/evaluation/modification, three main microbial platforms, saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, and escherichia coli, have emerged and they have performed well in pilot studies. while there are ongoing efforts to further enhance their properties, improvement of the fermentation process is just one of several factors-that needs to be fully optimized and integrated to generate a competitive lignocellulose ethanol plant.

TI  == iszm1068: an is5-like insertion element from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == a new insertion sequence, designated iszm1068, was isolated from zymomonas mobilis strain cp4. this element consists of 1,068 bp and contains one major orf  which shows similarities both at the nucleotide and at the amino acid sequence level with the corresponding orfs encoding the transposases of many is5 family elements, in particular the is1031 group. moreover, the z. mobilis orf shares the conserved n2, n3 and c1 signature motifs of the is4 and is5 families. six out of  seven z. mobilis wild-type strains were shown by hybridisation to contain a single copy of the iszm1068 element. nucleotide sequences of the insertion elements from these strains exhibited extremely high levels of identity, varying  from 94.25 to 99.25%. iszm1068 was shown to be active in escherichia coli cells and led to plasmid replicon fusions within the host cell. sequence analysis of rare cointegration and resolution derivatives suggests that iszm1068 has putative imperfect inverted repeats at its extremities of 18 bp (ir-right) and 14 bp (ir-left), and that a 3-bp (5'-tca-3') target sequence is duplicated upon insertion.

TI  == engineering a homo-ethanol pathway in escherichia coli: increased glycolytic flux and levels of expression of glycolytic genes during xylose fermentation.
AB  == replacement of the native fermentation pathway in escherichia coli b with a homo-ethanol pathway from zymomonas mobilis (pdc and adhb genes) resulted in a 30 to 50% increase in growth rate and glycolytic flux during the anaerobic fermentation of xylose. gene array analysis was used as a tool to investigate differences in expression levels for the 30 genes involved in xylose catabolism in the parent (strain b) and the engineered strain (ko11). of the 4,290 total open reading frames, only 8% were expressed at a significantly higher level in ko11 (p < 0.05). in contrast, over half of the 30 genes involved in the catabolism of xylose to pyruvate were expressed at 1.5-fold- to 8-fold-higher levels in ko11. for 14 of the 30 genes, higher expression was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (xylab, xyle, xylfg, xylr, rpia, rpib, pfka, fbaa, tpia, gapa, pgk, and pyka) during active fermentation (6, 12, and 24  h). values at single time points for only four of these genes (eno, fbaa, fbab, and tala) were higher in strain b than in ko11. the relationship between changes  in mrna (cdna) levels and changes in specific activities was verified for two genes (xyla and xylb) with good agreement. in ko11, expression levels and activities were threefold higher than in strain b for xylose isomerase (xyla) and twofold higher for xylulokinase (xylb). increased expression of genes involved in xylose catabolism is proposed as the basis for the increase in growth rate and glycolytic flux in ethanologenic ko11.

TI  == specificity of signal peptide recognition in tat-dependent bacterial protein translocation.
AB  == the bacterial twin arginine translocation (tat) pathway translocates across the cytoplasmic membrane folded proteins which, in most cases, contain a tightly bound cofactor. specific amino-terminal signal peptides that exhibit a conserved  amino acid consensus motif, s/t-r-r-x-f-l-k, direct these proteins to the tat translocon. the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (gfor) of zymomonas mobilis is a  periplasmic enzyme with tightly bound nadp as a cofactor. it is synthesized as a  cytoplasmic precursor with an amino-terminal signal peptide that shows all of the characteristics of a typical twin arginine signal peptide. however, gfor is not exported to the periplasm when expressed in the heterologous host escherichia coli, and enzymatically active pre-gfor is found in the cytoplasm. a precise replacement of the pre-gfor signal peptide by an authentic e. coli tat signal peptide, which is derived from pre-trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao) reductase (tora), allowed export of gfor, together with its bound cofactor, to the e. coli  periplasm. this export was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but not by sodium azide, and was blocked in e. coli tatc and tatae mutant strains, showing that membrane translocation of the tora-gfor fusion protein occurred via the tat pathway and not via the sec pathway. furthermore, tight cofactor binding (and therefore correct folding) was found to be a prerequisite for proper translocation of the fusion protein. these results strongly suggest that tat signal peptides are not universally recognized by different tat translocases, implying that the signal peptides of tat-dependent precursor proteins are optimally adapted only to their cognate export apparatus. such a situation is in marked contrast to the situation that is known to exist for sec-dependent protein translocation.

TI  == ethanol production from glucose and xylose by immobilized zymomonas mobilis cp4(pzb5).
AB  == fermentation of glucose-xylose mixtures to ethanol was investigated in batch and  continuous experiments using immobilized recombinant zymomonas mobilis cp4(pzb5). this microorganism was immobilized by entrapment in kappa-carrageenan beads having a diameter of 1.5-2.5 mm. batch experiments showed that the immobilized cells cofermented glucose and xylose to ethanol and that the presence of glucose  improved the xylose utilization rate. batch fermentation of rice straw hydrolysate containing 76 g/l of glucose and 33.8 g/l of xylose gave an ethanol concentration of 44.3 g/l after 24 h, corresponding to a yield of 0.46 g of ethanol/g of sugars. comparable results were achieved with a synthetic sugar control. continuous fermentation experiments were performed in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed bioreactor (fbr). glucose-xylose feed mixtures were pumped through  the fbr at residence times of 2-4 h. glucose conversion to ethanol was maintained above 98% in all experiments. xylose conversion to ethanol was highest at 91.5% for a feed containing 50 g/l of glucose and 13 g/l of xylose at a dilution rate of 0.24/h. the xylose conversion to ethanol decreased with increasing feed xylose concentration, dilution rate, and age of the immobilized cells. volumetric ethanol productivities in the range of 6.5-15.3 g/l.h were obtained. the improved productivities achieved in the fbr compared to other bioreactor systems can help  in reducing the production costs of fuel ethanol from lignocellulosic sugars.

AB  == the fermentation characteristics of a recombinant strain of zymomonas mobilis zm4(pzb5) capable of converting both glucose and xylose to ethanol have been further investigated. previous studies have shown that the strain zm4(pzb5) was capable of converting a mixture of 65 g/l of glucose and 65 g/l of xylose to 62 g/l of ethanol in 48 h with an overall yield of 0.46 g/g. higher sugar concentrations (e.g., 75/75 g/l) resulted in incomplete xylose utilization (80 h). in the present study, further kinetic evaluations at high sugar levels are reported. acetate inhibition studies and evaluation of temperature and ph effects indicated increased maximum specific uptake rates of glucose and xylose under stressed conditions with increased metabolic uncoupling. a high-productivity system was developed that involved a membrane bioreactor with cell recycling. at  sugar concentrations of approx 50/50 g/l of glucose/xylose, an ethanol concentration of 50 g/l, an ethanol productivity of approx 5 g/(l.h), and a yield (yp/s) of 0.50 g/g were achieved. decreases in cell viability were found in this  system after attainment of an initial steady state (40-60 h); a slow bleed of concentrated cells may be required to overcome this problem.

TI  == molecular characterization of squalene synthase from the green microalga botryococcus braunii, race b.
AB  == the green microalga botryococcus braunii produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons and is classified into three races, depending on the type of the hydrocarbon produced. the b race produces two types of triterpenoid hydrocarbons, squalene and botryococcene, both of which are putative condensation products of farnesyl diphosphate. in an attempt to better understand the regulation involved  in the production of squalene and botryococcene, we have isolated and characterized a squalene synthase (ss) gene from the b race of b. braunii. a 366-bp cdna fragment was initially obtained from the b race utilizing a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid sequences found in all ss enzymes. using this putative ss fragment as  a probe, a 2632-bp cdna clone was isolated from a cdna library. this cdna contained an open reading frame coding for a protein with 461 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 52.5 kda. comparison of the botryococcus ss (bss) with ss from different organisms showed 52% identity with nicotiana tabacum, 51%  with arabidopsis thaliana, 48% with zea mays, 40% with rat, 39% with yeast, and 26% with zymomonas mobilis. expression of full-length and carboxy-terminus truncated bss cdna in escherichia coli resulted in significant levels of bacterial ss enzyme activity but no botryococcene synthase activity. rna blot hybridization analysis of algal cultures during a culture cycle indicated that bss gene expression is preferential during rapid growth. given that the dna blot  analysis indicated only a single copy of the ss gene in the algal genome, these results suggest either that there exists coordinate expression of separate synthase genes for squalene and botryococcene biosynthesis or that there might be unique physiological conditions controlling the ss vs botryococcene synthase activity of a single peptide species.

TI  == probing the location and function of the conserved histidine residue of phosphoglucose isomerase by using an active site directed inhibitor n-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate.
AB  == phosphoglucose isomerase (ec 5.3.1.9) catalyzes the interconversion of d-glucopyranose-6-phosphate and d-fructofuranose-6-phosphate by promoting an intrahydrogen transfer between c1 and c2. a conserved histidine exists throughout all phosphoglucose isomerases and was hypothesized to be the base catalyzing the  isomerization reaction. in the present study, this conserved histidine, his311, of the enzyme from bacillus stearothermophilus was subjected to mutational analysis, and the mutational effect on the inactivation kinetics by n-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate was investigated. the substitution of his311  with alanine, asparagine, or glutamine resulted in the decrease of activity, in k(cat)/k(m), by a factor of 10(3), indicating the importance of this residue. n-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate inactivated irreversibly the activity of wild-type phosphoglucose isomerase; however, his311 --> ala became resistant to this inhibitor, indicating that his311 is located in the active site and is responsible for the inactivation of the enzyme by this active site-directed inhibitor. the pka of his311 was estimated to be 6.31 according to the ph dependence of the inactivation. the proximity of this value with the pka value of 6.35, determined from the ph dependence of k(cat)/k(m), supports a role of his311 as a general base in the catalysis.

TI  == biosynthetic burden and plasmid burden limit expression of chromosomally integrated heterologous genes (pdc, adhb) in escherichia coli.
AB  == previous studies have shown an unexpectedly high nutrient requirement for efficient ethanol production by ethanologenic recombinants of escherichia coli b  such as ly01 which contain chromosomally integrated zymomonas mobilis genes (pdc,adhb) encoding the ethanol pathway. the basis for this requirement has been  identified as a media-dependent effect on the expression of the z. mobilis genes  rather than a nutritional limitation. ethanol production was substantially increased without additional nutrients simply by increasing the level of pyruvate decarboxylase activity. this was accomplished by adding a multicopy plasmid containing pdc alone (but not adhb alone) to strain ly01, and by adding multicopy plasmids which express pdc and adhb from strong promoters. new strong promoters were isolated from random fragments of z. mobilis dna and characterized but were  not used to construct integrated biocatalysts. these promoters contained regions  resembling recognition sites for 3 different e. coli sigma factors: sigma(70), sigma(38), and sigma(28). the most effective plasmid-based promoters for fermentation were recognized by multiple sigma factors, expressed both pdc and adhb at high levels, and produced ethanol efficiently while allowing up to 80% reduction in complex nutrients as compared to ly01. the ability to utilize multiple sigma factors may be advantageous to maintain the high levels of pdc and adh needed for efficient ethanol production throughout batch fermentation. from this work, we propose that the activation of biosynthetic genes in nutrient-poor  media creates a biosynthetic burden that reduces the expression of chromosomal pdc and adhb by competing for transcriptional and translational machinery. this reduced expression can be viewed as analogous to the effect of plasmids (plasmid  burden) on the expression of native chromosomal genes.

TI  == fermentations with new recombinant organisms.
AB  == united states fuel ethanol production in 1998 exceeded the record production of 1.4 billion gallons set in 1995. most of this ethanol was produced from over 550  million bushels of corn. expanding fuel ethanol production will require developing lower-cost feedstocks, and only lignocellulosic feedstocks are available in sufficient quantities to substitute for corn starch. major technical hurdles to converting lignocellulose to ethanol include the lack of low-cost efficient enzymes for saccharification of biomass to fermentable sugars and the development of microorganisms for the fermentation of these mixed sugars. to date, the most successful research approaches to develop novel biocatalysts that  will efficiently ferment mixed sugar syrups include isolation of novel yeasts that ferment xylose, genetic engineering of escherichia coli and other gram negative bacteria for ethanol production, and genetic engineering of saccharoymces cerevisiae and zymomonas mobilis for pentose utilization. we have evaluated the fermentation of corn fiber hydrolyzates by the various strains developed. e. coli k011, e. coli sl40, e. coli fbr3, zymomonas cp4 (pzb5), and saccharomyces 1400 (plnh32) fermented corn fiber hydrolyzates to ethanol in the range of 21-34 g/l with yields ranging from 0.41 to 0.50 g of ethanol per gram of sugar consumed. progress with new recombinant microorganisms has been rapid and will continue with the eventual development of organisms suitable for commercial  ethanol production. each research approach holds considerable promise, with the possibility existing that different "industrially hardened" strains may find separate applications in the fermentation of specific feedstocks.

TI  == enteric bacterial catalysts for fuel ethanol production.
AB  == the technology is available to produce fuel ethanol from renewable lignocellulosic biomass. the current challenge is to assemble the various process options into a commercial venture and begin the task of incremental improvement.  current process designs for lignocellulose are far more complex than grain to ethanol processes. this complexity results in part from the complexity of the substrate and the biological limitations of the catalyst. our work at the university of florida has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using genes encoding zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. these two genes have been assembled into a portable ethanol production cassette, the pet operon, and integrated into the chromosome of escherichia coli b for use with hemicellulose-derived syrups. the resulting strain, ko11, produces ethanol efficiently from all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. by using the same approach, we integrated the pet operon into the chromosome of klebsiella oxytoca to produce strain p2 for use in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) process for cellulose. strain p2 has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. recently, the ability to produce and secrete high levels of endoglucanase has also been added to strain p2, further reducing the requirement for fungal cellulase. the general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts using the pet operon has been most successful with enteric bacteria but was also extended to gram positive bacteria, which have other useful traits for lignocellulose conversion. many opportunities remain for further improvements in these biocatalysts as we proceed toward the development of single organisms that can be used for the efficient fermentation of both hemicellulosic and cellulosic substrates.

TI  == exceptional characteristics of heterotetrameric (alpha 2 beta 2) e1p of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from zymomonas mobilis: expression from an own promoter and a lipoyl domain in e1 beta.
AB  == in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdhc) of zymomonas mobilis the beta subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (e1p) as well as the acetyltransferase (e2p) contain an n-terminal lipoyl domain. both lipoyl domains were acetylated in vitro using 2-14c-pyruvate as a substrate, demonstrating that both lipoyl domains can accept acetyl groups from the e1 component. as previously shown the structural genes (pdha alpha beta, pdhb, lpd) encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of z. mobilis are located in two distinct gene clusters, pdha alpha beta  and pdhb-orf2-lpd (u. neveling et al. (1998) j. bacteriol. 180, 1540-1548). analysis of pdh gene expression using lacz fusions revealed that the dna fragments upstream of pdha alpha, pdhb and lpd each have promoter activities. these pdh promoter activities were 7-30-fold higher in z. mobilis than in escherichia coli.

TI  == mutagenesis and crystallographic studies of zymomonas mobilis trna-guanine transglycosylase to elucidate the role of serine 103 for enzymatic activity.
AB  == the trna modifying enzyme trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt) is involved in the  exchange of guanine in the first position of the anticodon with preq1 as part of  the biosynthesis of the hypermodified base queuine (q). mutation of ser90 to an alanine in escherichia coli tgt leads to a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity (reuter, k. et al. (1994) biochemistry 33, 7041-7046). to further clarify the role of this residue in the catalytic center, we have mutated the corresponding ser103 of the crystallizable zymomonas mobilis tgt into alanine. the crystal structure of a tgt(s103a)/preq1 complex combined with biochemical data presented in this paper suggest that ser103 is essential for substrate orientation in the tgt reaction.

TI  == the efficient export of nadp-containing glucose-fructose oxidoreductase to the periplasm of zymomonas mobilis depends both on an intact twin-arginine motif in the signal peptide and on the generation of a structural export signal induced by cofactor binding.
AB  == the periplasmic, nadp-containing glucose-fructose oxidoreductase of the gram-negative bacterium zymomonas mobilis belongs to a class of redox cofactor-dependent enzymes which are exported with the aid of a signal peptide containing a so-called twin-arginine motif. in this paper we show that the replacement of one or both arginine residues results in drastically reduced translocation of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase to the periplasm, showing that this motif is essential. mutant proteins which, in contrast to wild-type glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, bind nadp in a looser and dissociable manner, were severely affected in the kinetics of plasma membrane translocation. these results strongly suggest that the translocation of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase into the periplasm uses a sec-independent apparatus which recognizes, as an additional signal, a conformational change in the structure of  the protein, most likely triggered by cofactor binding. furthermore, these results suggest that glucose-fructose oxidoreductase is exported in a folded form. a glucose-fructose oxidoreductase:beta-galactosidase fusion protein is not  lethal to z. mobilis cells and leads to the accumulation of the cytosolic preform of wild-type glucose-fructose oxidoreductase expressed in trans but not of a typical sec-substrate (ompa), indicating that the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase translocation apparatus can be blocked without interfering with the export of essential proteins via the sec pathway.

TI  == enhancement of expression and apparent secretion of erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celz) in escherichia coli b.
AB  == escherichia coli b has been engineered as a biocatalyst for the conversion of lignocellulose into ethanol. previous research has demonstrated that derivatives  of e. coli b can produce high levels of erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celz) as a periplasmic product and that this enzyme can function with commercial fungal cellulase to increase ethanol production. in this study, we have demonstrated two methods that improve celz expression in e. coli b. initially, with a low-copy-number vector, two e. coli glycolytic gene promoters (gap and eno) were tested and found to be less effective than the original celz promoter. by screening 18,000 random fragments of zymomonas mobilis dna, a surrogate promoter was identified which increased celz expression up to sixfold.  with this promoter, large polar inclusion bodies were clearly evident in the periplasmic space. sequencing revealed that the most active surrogate promoter is derived from five sau3a1 fragments, one of which was previously sequenced in z. mobilis. visual inspection indicated that this dna fragment contains at least five putative promoter regions, two of which were confirmed by primer extension analysis. addition of the out genes from e. chrysanthemi ec16 caused a further increase in the production of active enzyme and facilitated secretion or release  of over half of the activity into the extracellular environment. with the most active construct, of a total of 13,000 iu of active enzyme per liter of culture,  7,800 iu was in the supernatant. the total active endoglucanase was estimated to  represent 4 to 6% of cellular protein.

TI  == metabolic engineering of bacteria for ethanol production
AB  == technologies are available which will allow the conversion of lignocellulose into fuel ethanol using genetically engineered bacteria. assembling these into a cost-effective process remains a challenge. our work has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using a portable ethanol production pathway. genes encoding zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been integrated into the chromosome of escherichia coli b to produce strain ko11 for the fermentation of hemicellulose-derived syrups. this organism can efficiently ferment all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. klebsiella oxytoca m5a1 has been genetically engineered in a similar manner to produce strain p2 for ethanol production from cellulose. this organism has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. the optimal ph for cellulose fermentation with this organism (ph 5.0-5.5) is near that of fungal cellulases. the general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts has been most successful with enteric bacteria thus far. however, this approach may also prove useful with gram-positive bacteria which have other  important traits for lignocellulose conversion. many opportunities remain for further improvements in the biomass to ethanol processes. these include the development of enzyme-based systems which eliminate the need for dilute acid hydrolysis or other pretreatments, improvements in existing pretreatments for enzymatic hydrolysis, process improvements to increase the effective use of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes, improvements in rates of ethanol production, decreased nutrient costs, increases in ethanol concentrations achieved in biomass beers, increased resistance of the biocatalysts to lignocellulosic-derived toxins, etc. to be useful, each of these improvements must result in a decrease in the cost for ethanol production. copyright 1998 john wiley & sons, inc.

TI  == application of mathematical tools for metabolic design of microbial ethanol production.
AB  == many attempts to engineer cellular metabolism have failed due to the complexity of cellular functions. mathematical and computational methods are needed that can organize the available experimental information, and provide insight and guidance for successful metabolic engineering. two such methods are reviewed here. both methods employ a (log)linear kinetic model of metabolism that is constructed based on enzyme kinetics characteristics. the first method allows the description of the dynamic responses of metabolic systems subject to spatiotemporal variations in their parameters. the second method considers the product-oriented, constrained optimization of metabolic reaction networks using mixed-integer linear programming methods. the optimization framework is used in order to identify the combinations of the metabolic characteristics of the glycolytic enzymes from yeast and bacteria that will maximize ethanol production. the methods are also applied to the design of microbial ethanol production metabolism. the results of the calculations are in qualitative agreement with experimental data presented here. experiments and calculations suggest that, in resting escherichia coli cells, ethanol production and glucose uptake rates can be increased by 30% and 20%, respectively, by overexpression of a deregulated pyruvate kinase, while increase in phosphofructokinase expression levels has no effect on ethanol production and glucose uptake rates.

AB  == planar asymmetric glycolipid/phospholipid bilayer membranes were used as a reconstitution model of the lipid matrix of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria to study complement (c) activation by various bacterial surface glycolipids with the aim of defining the c activation pathway. as glycolipids the lipopolysaccharides of salmonella enterica serovar minnesota r mutant strains r595 (re lps) and r4 (rd2 lps), pentaacyl lipid a from the lps of the escherichia coli re mutant f515, and glycosphingolipid gsl-1 of sphingomonas paucimobilis iam 12576 were used. methylester and carboxyl-reduced derivatives of gsl-1 were used  to elucidate the role of the carboxyl group as common functional group of lps and gsl-1 for c activation. the formation of lytic pores was monitored via the measurement of changes in membrane current. for all glycolipids we observed a considerable increase in membrane current soon after addition of whole human serum due to the formation of lytic pores in the membranes. pore formation was dependent on the presence of c9, indicating that the observed current changes were due to c activation. we found that in our reconstitution system of the outer membrane lipid a, re lps, and rd2 lps activated the classical pathway, the activation being independent of specific anti-lps antibodies. in contrast, gsl-1  and the methylester derivative of gsl-1 activated the alternative pathway even at the low serum concentrations used in this study (about 0.2% v/v). interestingly,  the carboxyl reduced gsl-1 activated the classical pathway.

TI  == novel selection for isoniazid (inh) resistance genes supports a role for nad+-binding proteins in mycobacterial inh resistance.
AB  == the genetic basis of isoniazid (inh) resistance remains unknown for a significant proportion of clinical isolates. to identify genes which might confer resistance  by detoxifying or sequestering inh, we transformed the escherichia coli oxyr mutant, which is relatively sensitive to inh, with a mycobacterium tuberculosis plasmid library and selected for inh-resistant clones. three genes were identified and called ceo for their ability to complement the escherichia coli oxyr mutant. ceoa was the previously identified m. tuberculosis glf gene, which encodes a 399-amino-acid nad+- and flavin adenine dinucleotide-requiring enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of udp-galactopyranose to udp-galactofuranose. the proteins encoded by the ceobc pair were homologous with  one another and with the n terminus of the potassium uptake regulatory protein trka. each of the three ceo proteins contains a motif common to nad+ binding pockets. overexpression of the m. tuberculosis glf gene by placing it under the control of the hsp60 promoter on a multicopy plasmid in mycobacterium bovis bcg produced a strain for which the inh mic was increased 50% compared to that for the control strains, while similar overexpression of the ceobc pair had no effect on inh susceptibility in bcg. mycobacterial extracts containing the overexpressed glf protein did not bind radiolabeled inh directly, suggesting a more complex mechanism than the binding of unmodified inh. our results support the hypothesis  that upregulated mycobacterial proteins such as glf may contribute to inh resistance in m. tuberculosis by binding a modified form of inh or by sequestering a factor such as nad+ required for inh activity.

AB  == escherichia coli ko11 was previously constructed to produce ethanol from acid hydrolysates of hemicellulose (pentoses and hexoses) by the chromosomal integration of zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and  alcohol dehydrogenase (adhb). klebsiella oxytoca p2 was constructed in an analogous fashion for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cellulose and contains pts enzymes for cellobiose. in this study, ko11 was further engineered for the fermentation of cellulose by adding the k. oxytoca casab genes encoding enzyme iicellobiose and phospho-beta-glucosidase. although the two k. oxytoca genes were well expressed in cloning hosts such as dh5 alpha,  both were expressed poorly in e. coli ko11, a derivative of e. coli b. spontaneous mutants which exhibited more than 15-fold-higher specific activities  for cellobiose metabolism were isolated. the mutations of these mutants resided in the plasmid rather than the host. three mutants were characterized by sequence analysis. all contained similar internal deletions which eliminated the casab promoter and operator regions and placed the lacz shine-dalgarno region immediately upstream from the casa shine-dalgarno region. ko11 harboring mutant plasmids (ploi1908, ploi1909, or ploi1910) rapidly fermented cellobiose to ethanol, and the yield was more than 90% of the theoretical yield. two of these strains were used with commercial cellulase to ferment mixed-waste office paper to ethanol.

TI  == the role of his113 and his114 in pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) is one of several enzymes that require thiamin diphosphate (thdp) and a divalent cation as essential cofactors. recently, the three-dimensional structures of the enzyme from two yeasts have been determined.  while these structures shed light on the binding of the cofactors and the reaction mechanism, the interactions between the substrate pyruvate and the enzyme remain unclear. we have used pdc from zymomonas mobilis as a model for these enzymes in order to study substrate binding. the recombinant enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli. high yield, simplicity of purification, high stability and simple kinetics make this model well suited for these studies. activity measurements in the ph range between 5.8 and 8.5 indicated that a his residue may be involved in substrate binding. analysis of an alignment of all known pdc protein sequences showed two invariant his residues (his113 and his114) which, according to the crystal structure of yeast pdc, are in the vicinity of the active site. here we demonstrate that replacement of his114 by gln does not have a great effect on cofactor and substrate binding. however, the k(cat) is decreased indicating that his114 may assist in catalysis. in contrast, substitution of his113 by gln renders the enzyme completely inactive. this mutant has decreased affinity for both cofactors, as revealed by measurements of tryptophan fluorescence quenching. however, this decreased affinity is insufficient to account for the complete loss of activity. despite its inability  to support overall catalysis, this [gln113]pdc mutant is capable of releasing acetaldehyde from 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)thiamin diphosphate supplied exogenously. it  is proposed that upon substrate binding, his113 is placed close to c2 of the thiazole ring. subsequent deprotonation of this atom leads to a conformational change that allows a flexible loop (residues 105-112) that precedes his113 to close over the active site. hence, replacement of his113 by another residue interferes with this closure of the active site and thus disrupts the catalytic process.

TI  == squalene-hopene cyclase from bradyrhizobium japonicum: cloning, expression, sequence analysis and comparison to other triterpenoid cyclases.
AB  == with the help of a pcr-based screening method, the gene encoding squalenehopene cyclase (shc) of bradyrhizobium japonicum usda 110 was isolated from a cosmid library. the shc catalyses the cyclization of squalene to hopanoids, a class of triterpenoid lipids recently discovered in nitrogen-fixing, root-nodule-forming bradyrhizobium bacteria. hybridization experiments showed that the gene is present in bacteria of all bradyrhizobium strains tested and in photosynthetic bacteria forming stem nodules on tropical legumes of the genus aeschynomene. the  bradyrhizobium shc gene is 1983 bp in length and encodes a protein of 660 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 73671 da. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the sequences of other shcs revealed highest similarity (70%) to the shc from the gram-negative zymomonas mobilis and lower similarity (48%) to the shcs from the gram-positive alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris. bradyrhizobium shc also showed similarity (38-43%) to eukaryotic oxidosqualene cyclases. the b. japonicum shc gene was expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant shc catalysed the cyclization of squalene to the hopanoids hopene and diplopterol in vitro. however, the formation of the gammacerane derivative tetrahymanol, which is produced in addition to hopanoids in b. japonicum strains in vivo, could not be detected in vitro. therefore, the presence of a second squalene cyclase in b. japonicum can be assumed. sequence analysis of 0.5 kb upstream from the shc gene  identified a partial orf with significant similarity to the c-terminus of an orf  located immediately upstream from the shc gene in z. mobilis. both orfs also showed similarity to phytoene desaturases from cyanobacteria and plants. the 3'-end of this orf from b. japonicum overlaps with 13 bp at the 5'-end of shc. the close proximity of this orf to shc suggests that shc and this orf may be part of an operon.

TI  == transposon mutagenesis and strain construction in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == conjugative or mobilizable plasmids carrying the transposable elements tn5, tn501 or mini mu were readily transferred from escherichia coli donors into zymomonas mobilis recipients with frequencies depending both on donor and recipient strain  used. with the exception of pulb113 (rp4::mini mu), all foreign plasmids exhibited high instability in z. mobilis transconjugants under both selective and non-selective conditions. transposition events and consequent mutagenesis occurred readily in z. mobilis transconjugant strains, with tn5 and tn501 being far less successful than mini mu. transposon mutagenesis with the help of mini mu resulted in the isolation of a large number of independent auxotrophs with polyauxotrophs, cysteine, methionine and isoleucine requiring-isolates being the  most frequent. when chromosomal dna from all these mutants was digested with various restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction patterns were hybridized with a mini mu probe, the majority of these mutants appeared to have insertions at different sites of the chromosome. thus, transposon mutagenesis by  mini mu is proven to be a simple and efficient tool for mutant production and the genetic analysis of z. mobilis.

TI  == extracellular melibiose and fructose are intermediates in raffinose catabolism during fermentation to ethanol by engineered enteric bacteria.
AB  == contrary to general concepts of bacterial saccharide metabolism, melibiose (25 to 32 g/liter) and fructose (5 to 14 g/liter) accumulated as extracellular intermediates during the catabolism of raffinose (o-alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-1, 6-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-d-fructofuranoside) (90 g/liter) by ethanologenic recombinants of escherichia coli b, klebsiella oxytoca m5a1, and erwinia chrysanthemi ec16. both hydrolysis products (melibiose and fructose) were subsequently transported and further metabolized by all three organisms. raffinose catabolism was initiated by beta-fructosidase; melibiose was subsequently hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose by alpha-galactosidase. glucose  and fructose were completely metabolized by all three organisms, but galactose accumulated in the fermentation broth with ec16(ploi555) and p2. mm2 (a raffinose-positive e. coli mutant) was the most effective biocatalyst for ethanol production (38 g/liter) from raffinose. all organisms rapidly fermented sucrose (90 g/liter) to ethanol (48 g/liter) at more than 90% of the theoretical yield. during sucrose catabolism, both hydrolysis products (glucose and fructose) were metabolized concurrently by ec16(ploi555) and p2 without sugar leakage. however,  fructose accumulated extracellularly (27 to 28 g/liter) at early stages of fermentation with ko11 and mm2. sequential utilization of glucose and fructose correlated with a diauxie in base utilization (ph maintenance). the mechanism of  sugar escape remains unknown but may involve downhill leakage via permease which  transports precursor saccharides or novel sugar export proteins. if sugar escape  occurs in nature with wild organisms, it could facilitate the development of complex bacterial communities which are based on the sequence of saccharide catabolism and the hierarchy of sugar utilization.

TI  == expression of the zymomonas mobilis gfo gene or nadp-containing glucose:fructose  oxidoreductase (gfor) in escherichia coli. formation of enzymatically active pregfor but lack of processing into a stable periplasmic protein.
AB  == glucose:fructose oxidoreductase (gfor) of the gram-negative bacterium zymomonas mobilis is a periplasmic enzyme with tightly bound cofactor nadp. the preprotein  carries an unusually long n-terminal signal peptide of 52 amino acid residues. expression of the gfo gene in cells of escherichia coli k12, under the control of a tac promoter, led to immunologically detectable proteins in western blots, and  to the formation of an enzymatically active precursor form (pregfor), located in  the cytosol. processing of pregfor to the mature form was not observed in e. coli. replacement of the authentic gfor signal peptide by the shorter signal peptides of phoa or ompa from e. coli led to processing of the respective gfor precursor proteins. however, the processed proteins were unstable and rapidly degraded in the periplasm unless an e. coli mutant was used that carried a triple lesion for periplasmic and outer-membrane proteases. when fusion-protein export was inhibited by sodium azide or carboxylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the cytoplasmic precursor forms of the respective pregfor were not degraded. a major  protease-resistant gfor peptide from the ompa-gfor fusion was found within spheroplasts of e. coli to which nadp had been added externally. the formation of this peptide did not occur in the presence of nad. it is concluded that nadp is required for gfor to fold into its native conformation and that its absence from  the e. coli periplasm is responsible for failure to form a stable periplasmic protein. the results strongly suggest that, in z. mobilis, additional protein factors are required for the transport of nadp across the plasma membrane and/or  incorporation of nadp into the gfor apoenzyme.

TI  == metabolic engineering for the production of carotenoids in non-carotenogenic bacteria and yeasts.
AB  == the crt gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of carotenoids such as lycopene, beta-carotene and astaxanthin have been isolated from carotenogenic bacteria such as erwinia species and the marine bacterium agrobacterium aurantiacum. the functions of the individual genes have been identified. the first substrate of the enzymes encoded by the erwinia crt clusters is farnesyl pyrophosphate which is not only the precursor for carotenoid biosynthesis but also sterols, dolichols and other numerous isoprenoid compounds. escherichia coli does not naturally synthesize carotenoids, but by using the carotenogenic genes recombinant strains accumulating lycopene, beta-carotene and astaxanthin have been produced. other non-carotenogenic bacteria such as zymomonas mobilis have also been engineered to produce beta-carotene by the introduction of the corresponding crt genes. a gene capable of enhancing carotenoid levels in e. coli has also been isolated from cdna libraries of the yeast phaffia rhodozyma and the green alga haematococcus pluvialis. this gene has been found to encode an isopentenyl pyrophophate isomerase. it has further been shown that the edible yeasts candida utilis as well as saccharomyces cerevisiae, which possess no carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, acquire the ability to produce carotenoids, when the carotenogenic genes are expressed under the control of yeast-derived promoters and terminators. it has been observed in the yeasts s. cerevisiae and c. utilis carrying the lycopene biosynthesis genes that ergosterol content is decreased by 10 and 35%, respectively. it is therefore likely that the carbon flux for the ergosterol biosynthesis has been partially directed from farnesyl pyrophosphate to a new pathway for the lycopene biosynthesis. further, the expression of a truncated gene which codes for the catalytic domain of the endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. a reductase, has been found to be effective for enhancing carotenoid levels in the yeast c. utilis.

TI  == cysteine 265 is in the active site of, but is not essential for catalysis by trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt) from escherichia coli.
AB  == site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have previously shown that the trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt) from escherichia coli is a zinc metalloprotein and identified the enzymic ligands to the zinc [chong et al. (1995), biochemistry 34, 3694-3701; garcia et al. (1966), biochemistry 35, 3133-3139]. during these studies one mutant, tgt (c265a), was found to exhibit a significantly lower specific activity, but was not found to be involved in the zinc site. the present report demonstrates that tgt is inactivated by treatment with thiol reagents (e.g., dtnb, mmts, and n-ethylmaleimide). further, this inactivation is shown to be due to modification  of cysteine 265. the kinetic parameters for the mutants tgt (c265a) and tgt (c265s), however, suggest that this residue is not performing a critical role in  the tgt reaction. we conclude that cysteine 265 is in the active site of tgt, but is not performing a critical catalytic function. this conclusion is supported by  the recent determination of the x-ray crystal structure of the tgt from zymomonas mobilis [romier et al. (1966), embo j. 15, 2850-2857], which reveals that the residue corresponding to cysteine 265 is distant from the putative catalytic site, but is in the middle of a region of the enzyme surface proposed to bind trna.

TI  == stabilization of pet operon plasmids and ethanol production in escherichia coli strains lacking lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase activities.
AB  == in the last decade, a major goal of research in biofuels has been to metabolically engineer microorganisms to ferment multiple sugars from biomass or  agricultural wastes to fuel ethanol. escherichia coli strains genetically engineered to contain the pet operon (zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase b genes) produce high levels of ethanol. strains carrying the pet operon in plasmid (e.g., e. coli b/ploi297) or in chromosomal (e.g., e. coli ko11) sites require antibiotics in the media to maintain genetic stability and high ethanol productivity. to overcome this requirement, we used the conditionally lethal e. coli strain fmj39, which carries mutations for lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase and grows aerobically but is incapable of anaerobic growth unless these mutations are complemented. e. coli fbr1 and fbr2 were created by transforming e. coli fmj39 with the pet operon plasmids ploi295 and ploi297, respectively. both strains were capable of anaerobic growth and displayed no apparent pet plasmid losses after 60 generations in serially transferred (nine times) anaerobic batch cultures. in contrast, similar aerobic cultures rapidly lost plasmids. in high-cell-density batch fermentations, 3.8% (wt/vol) ethanol (strain fbr1) and 4.4% (wt/vol) ethanol (strain fbr2) were made from 10% glucose. anaerobic, glucose-limited continuous cultures of strain fbr2 grown for 20 days (51 generations; 23 with tetracycline and then 28 after tetracycline removal) showed no loss of antibiotic resistance. anaerobic, serially transferred batch cultures and high-density fermentations were inoculated with cells taken at 57 generations from the previous continuous culture. both cultures continued to produce high levels of ethanol in the absence of tetracycline. the genetic stability conferred by selective pressure for pet-containing cells without requirement for antibiotics suggests potential commercial suitability for e. coli fbr1 and fbr2.

TI  == development of an arabinose-fermenting zymomonas mobilis strain by metabolic pathway engineering.
AB  == the substrate fermentation range of the ethanologenic bacterium zymomonas mobilis was expanded to include the pentose sugar, l-arabinose, which is commonly found in agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic biomass. five genes, encoding  l-arabinose isomerase (araa), l-ribulokinase (arab), l-ribulose-5-phosphate-4-epimerase (arad), transaldolase (talb), and transketolase (tkta), were isolated from escherichia coli and introduced into z.  mobilis under the control of constitutive promoters that permitted their expression even in the presence of glucose. the engineered strain grew on and produced ethanol from l-arabinose as a sole c source at 98% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield, based on the amount of consumed sugar. this indicates  that arabinose was metabolized almost exclusively to ethanol as the sole fermentation product, with little by-product formation. although no diauxic growth pattern was evident, the microorganism preferentially utilized glucose before arabinose, apparently reflecting the specificity of the indigenous facilitated diffusion transport system. this microorganism may be useful, along with the previously developed xylose-fermenting z. mobilis (m. zhang, c. eddy, k. deanda, m. finkelstein, and s. picataggio, science 267:240-243, 1995), in a mixed culture for efficient fermentation of the predominant hexose and pentose sugars in agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic feedstocks to ethanol.

TI  == expression of the escherichia coli pmi gene, encoding phosphomannose-isomerase in zymomonas mobilis, leads to utilization of mannose as a novel growth substrate, which can be used as a selective marker.
AB  == wild-type zymomonas mobilis can utilize only three substrates (sucrose, glucose,  and fructose) as sole carbon sources, which are largely converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. here, we show that although d-mannose is not used as a growth substrate, it is taken up via the glucose uniport system (glucose facilitator protein) with a vmax similar to that of glucose. moreover, d-mannose was phosphorylated by a side activity of the resident fructokinase to mannose-6-phosphate. fructokinase was purified to homogeneity from an frk-recombinant z. mobilis strain showing a specific activity of 205 +/- 25 u of  protein mg-1 with fructose (k(m), 0.75 +/- 0.06 mm) and 17 +/- 2 u mg-1 (relative activity, 8.5%) with mannose (k(m), 0.65 +/- 0.08 mm). however, no phosphomannoseisomerase activity could be detected for z. mobilis, and this appeared to be the reason for the lack of growth on mannose. therefore, we introduced the escherichia coli gene pmi (mana) in z. mobilis under the control of a laciq-ptac system on a broad-host-range plasmid (pzy507; cmr). subsequently, in pmi-recombinant cells of z. mobilis, phosphomannoseisomerase was expressed in  a range of from 3 u (without isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside [iptg]) to 20 u mg-1 of protein in crude extracts (after iptg induction). recombinant cells of  different z. mobilis strains utilized mannose (4%) as the sole carbon source with a growth rate of 0.07 h-1, provided that they contained fructokinase activity. when the frk gene was additionally expressed from the same vector, fructokinase activities of as much as 9.7 u mg-1 and growth rates of as much as 0.25 h-1 were  detected, compared with 0.34 h-1 on fructose for wild-type z. mobilis. selection  for growth on mannose was used to monitor plasmid transfer of pzy507pmi from e. coli to z. mobilis strains and could replace the previous selection for antibiotic resistance.

TI  == the gluemp operon from zymomonas mobilis encodes a high-affinity glutamate carrier with similarity to binding-protein-dependent transport systems.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence downstream of the grp gene, encoding the glutamate uptake regulatory protein of zymomonas mobilis, was determined. three clustered genes (glue, glum, and glup) close to ghe grp gene, but on the opposite strand, were identified. these genes encode a high-affinity transport system for glutamate and aspartate. the glup gene product is a polypeptide of 25.4 kda and contains segments with significant similarity to the atp-binding proteins of binding-protein-dependent transport systems. the glum polypeptide (22.9 kda) is highly hydrophobic and consists of four potential membrane-spanning domains. the  hydrophilic glue gene product, with a molecular mass of 22.1 kda, contains a region with sequence similarity to some of the periplasmic binding proteins and a sequence motif of a signal peptide for periplasmic localization. the transport system could not be functionally expressed in z. mobilis. however, when heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, it catalyzed uptake of glutamate, which was characterized kinetically. our results suggest that the glutamate transport system encoded by the gluemp operon is repressed in z. mobilis by the regulatory protein grp.

TI  == the role of residues glutamate-50 and phenylalanine-496 in zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  == several enzymes require thiamine diphosphate (thdp) as an essential cofactor, and we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc; ec 4.1.1.1) from zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. it is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification, homotetrameric subunit structure and simple kinetic properties. crystallographic analyses of three thdp-dependent enzymes [muller, lindqvist, furey, schulz, jordan and schneider (1993) structure 1, 95-103] have suggested that an invariant glutamate  participates in catalysis. in order to evaluate the role of this residue, identified in pdc from zymomonas mobilis as glu-50, it has been altered to glutamine and aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene. the mutant proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. here we demonstrate that substitution with aspartate yields an enzyme with 3% of the activity of the wild-type, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. replacement of glu-50 with glutamine yields an enzyme with only 0.5% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. each of these mutant enzymes has a decreased affinity for both  thdp and mg2+. it has been reported that the binding of cofactors to apopdc quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence [diefenbach and duggleby (1991) biochem. j. 276, 439-445] and we have identified the residue responsible as trp-487 [diefenbach, candy, mattick and duggleby (1992) febs lett. 296, 95-98]. although this residue is some distance from the cofactor binding site, it lies in the dimer interface, and the proposal has been put forward [dyda, furey, swaminathan, sax, farrenkopf and jordan (1993) biochemistry 32, 6165-6170] that alteration of ring stacking with phe-496 of the adjacent subunit is the mechanism of fluorescence quenching when cofactors bind. the closely related enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase (from enterobacter cloacae) has a leucine residue at the position corresponding to phe-496 but shows fluorescence quenching properties that are similar to those of pdc. this suggests that the fluorescence quenching is due to some perturbation of the local environment of trp-487 rather than to a  specific interaction with phe-496. this latter hypothesis is supported by our data: mutation of this phenylalanine to leucine, isoleucine or histidine in pdc does not eliminate the fluorescence quenching upon addition of cofactors.

AB  == to be economic and to be compatible with modern continuous bioconversion systems, it is imperative that the process organism exhibits an extremely high degree of stability. in the case of ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, functional stability of the potential process biocatalyst can be assessed in terms of the capacity to sustain high-performance fermentation during the continuous fermentation of biomass-derived sugars. this investigation employed glucose- or xylose-limited chemostat culture to examine the functional stability  of two patented, genetically engineered e. coli-namely e. coli b (atcc 11303) carrying the zymomonas genes for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase ii on a multicopy plasmid ploi297 and a chromosomal pet integrant of strain 11303, designated as strain ko11. both recombinants carry markers for antibiotic  resistance and have been reported to exhibit genetic stability in the absence of  antibiotic selection. chemostats were fed with luria broth (lb) (with 25 g/l sugar) at a dilution rate of 0.14 and 0.07/h when the feed medium was glucose-lb  and xylose-lb, respectively. they ph was controlled at 6.3. with glucose, both recombinants exhibited a rapid loss of ethanologenicity even when selection pressure was imposed by the inclusion of antibiotics in the feed medium. with strain ko11, increasing the concentration of chloramphenicol from 40 to 300 mg/l, resulted in a retardation in the rate of loss of ethanologenicity, but it did not prevent it. under xylose limitation, the plasmid-bearing recombinant appeared to  be stabilized by antibiotics, but this did not reflect genetic stability, since the slower-growing revertant was washed out at a dilution rate of 0.07/h. with both recombinants, interpretation of functional stability with xylose was complicated by the inherent ethanologenicity associated with the host culture. based on an average cost for large bulk quantities of antibiotics at $55/kg and an amendment level of 40 g/m3, the estimated economic impact regarding the potential requirement for operational stabilization by antibiotics in a plant operating in batch mode varied from a maximum of 29 cents/gal of e95 ethanol for  antibiotic amendment of all fermentation media to a minimum of 0.45 cents/gal where antibiotics were used exclusively for the preparation of the inocula for every fourth batch fermentation cycle. the high degree of instability observed in these continuous fermentations does not auger well for the proposed potential industrial utility of these patented, genetically engineered constructs for the production of fuel ethanol from biomass and wastes.

TI  == the relationship between growth enhancement and pet expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the pet operon consists of genes coding for enzymes responsible for ethanol production and consists of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase ii from the high-performance ethanologen zymomonas mobilis. this article describes the physiological influence of pet expression in escherichia coli b (atcc 11303)  in terms of growth rate and overall concentrations of cell mass and catabolic end products achieved under well-defined cultivation conditions that included constant ph and carbon (energy) limitation. glucose, mannose, and xylose were used as substrates, because they represent the principal fermentable components of lignocellulosic biomass and because fermentation of these sugars involves different metabolic pathways. two different types of ethanologenic recombinants were used-a strain in which pet expression was via a multicopy plasmid (plo1297)  and a chromosomal integrant, strain ko11. under the condition of sugar substrate  limitation, there was no growth enhancement by pet expression with either glucose or mannose. whereas the host strain produced exclusively lactic acid from glucose and mannose, both recombinants produced mostly ethanol. both the plasmid-carrying strain and the pet integrant exhibited slower growth compared to the host culture with glucose or mannose as fermentation substrate. with mannose, the plasmid recombinant grew appreciably slower than either the host culture or the recombinant ko11. use of a magnesium-deficient medium produced different results  with glucose since substrate and turbidometric measurements proved to be unreliable in terms of estimating overall biomass levels. at ph 6.3, pet expression improved overall biomass yield; but at ph 7.0, the cell yields exhibited by the plasmid recombinant and the host strain were the same. e. coli b did not grow well on xylose as sole carbon source. with xylose, pet expression increased the growth rate, but had no effect on the overall biomass yield. in comparing our observations with the reports of others, it was concluded that the  effect of pet expression on growth of e.coli is dependent on several different biochemical, physiological, genetic, and environmental factors, which largely precludes a statement of generality regarding this phenomenon.

TI  == the cyanobacterium synechococcus sp. strain pcc 7942 contains a second alkaline phosphatase encoded by phov.
AB  == a gene (phov) encoding an alkaline phosphatase from synechococcus sp. strain pcc  7942 was isolated by screening a plasmid gene bank for expression of alkaline phosphatase activity in escherichia coli jm103. two independent clones carrying the same alkaline-phosphatase-encoding gene were isolated. one of these clones (pkw1) was further analysed and the nucleotide sequence of a contiguous 3234 bp dna fragment was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf1 and phov) and an incomplete orf3 were identified reading in the same direction. the deduced phov gene product showed 34% identity to the alkaline phosphatase phoa from zymomonas mobilis, and the n-terminal part of the putative orf3 protein exhibited 57% identity to a protein of unknown function from frankia sp. insertional inactivation of the synechococcus pcc 7942 phov gene failed, indicating an essential role for either the phov or the orf3 gene product. phov consists of 550 amino acid residues, resulting in a molecular mass of 61.3 kda. to overexpress the synechococcus pcc 7942 phov gene in e. coli, plasmid pkw1 was transformed into a phoa mutant of e. coli (cc118). in e. coli strain cc118(pkw1) phov was expressed constitutively with high rates of activity, and was shown to be membrane associated in the periplasmic space. after partial purification of the recombinant phov, it was shown that, like other alkaline phosphatases, the synechococcus phov had a broad ph optimum in the alkaline region and a broad substrate specificity for phosphomonoesters, required zn2+ for activity, and was  inhibited by phosphate. in contrast to several other alkaline phosphatases, phov  was inhibited by mn2+. due to the lack of a synechococcus pcc 7942 phov mutant strain, the function of phov remains uncertain. however, the present results show that synechococcus pcc 7942 has a second, probably phosphate-irrepressible, alkaline phosphatase (phov, 61.3 kda) in addition to the phosphate-repressible enzyme (phoa, 145 kda) already described.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == development of a gene reporter system in moderately halophilic bacteria by employing the ice nucleation gene of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the expression of the ice nucleation gene inaz of pseudomonas syringae in several moderate halophiles was investigated to establish its utility as a reporter for promoter activity and gene expression studies in these biotechnologically and environmentally important bacteria. a promoterless version of inaz was introduced in two different restriction sites and at both orientations in a recombinant plasmid able to replicate in moderate halophiles and, in particular, within the sequence of its phe1 part, a native plasmid of halomonas elongata. one orientation of both recombinant constructs expressed high levels of ice nucleation activity in h. elongata and volcaniella eurihalina cells, indicating that inaz was probably introduced in the correct orientation downstream of putative native promoters. a recombinant construct carrying a tandem duplication  of inaz at the same orientation gave significantly higher ice nucleation activity, showing that inaz is appropriate for gene dosage studies. the ice nucleation gene was also expressed in h. elongata and v. eurihalina under the control of pbla (the promoter of the beta-lactamase gene of escherichia coli) and ppdc (the promoter of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene of zymomonas mobilis). one  of the inaz reporter plasmids expressing high levels of ice nucleation activity under the control of a native putative promoter was also transferred in halomonas subglaciescola, halomonas meridiana, halomonas halodurans, and deleya halophila.  in all cases, ice+ transconjugants were successfully isolated, demonstrating that inaz is expressed in a wide spectrum of moderately halophilic species.

TI  == sequence analysis and overexpression of the zymomonas mobilis tgt gene encoding trna-guanine transglycosylase: purification and biochemical characterization of the enzyme.
AB  == trna-guanine transglycosylase (tgt) is involved in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified trna nucleoside queuosine (q). it catalyzes the posttranscriptional base exchange of the q precursor 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preq1) with the genetically encoded guanine in the anticodon of trna(asp), trna(asn), trna(his),  and trna(tyr). a partially sequenced gene upstream of the dna ligase (lig) gene of the zymomonas mobilis chromosome shows strong homology to the tgt gene of escherichia coli (k.b. shark and t. conway, fems microbiol. lett. 96:19-26, 1992). we showed that this gene is able to complement the tgt mutation in e. coli sj1505, and we determined its complete sequence. four start codons were possible  for this gene, resulting in proteins of 386 to 399 amino acids (m(r), 42,800 to 44,300) showing 60.4% sequence identity with tgt from e. coli. the smallest of the four possible reading frames, which was still extended at its 5' end compared with the e. coli tgt gene, was overexpressed in e. coli. the gene product was purified to homogeneity and was biochemically characterized. the kinetical parameters were virtually identical to those published for the e. coli enzyme. in contrast to e. coli tgt, which is reported to be a homotrimer, z. mobilis tgt was found to be a monomer according to gel filtration. in this study, it was shown that the formation of homotrimers by the e. coli enzyme is readily reversible and is dependent on protein concentration.

TI  == the glutamate uptake regulatory protein (grp) of zymomonas mobilis and its relation to the global regulator lrp of escherichia coli.
AB  == after being expressed in escherichia coli jc5412, which is defective in glutamate transport, a zymomonas mobilis gene which enabled this strain to grow on glutamate was cloned. this gene encodes a protein with 33% amino acid identity to the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (lrp) of e. coli. although overall glutamate uptake in e. coli was increased, the protein encoded by the cloned fragment repressed the secondary h+/glutamate transport system gltp by interaction with the promoter region of the gltp gene. it also repressed the secondary, h(+)-coupled glutamate uptake system of z. mobilis, indicating that at least one role of this protein in z. mobilis is to regulate glutamate transport.  consequently, it was designated grp (for glutamate uptake regulatory protein). when expressed in e. coli, grp repressed the secondary h+/glutamate transport system gltp by binding to the regulatory regions of the gltp gene. an lrp mutation in e. coli was complemented in trans with respect to the positive expression regulation of ilvih (coding for acetohydroxy acid synthase iii) by a plasmid which carries the grp gene. the expression of grp is autoregulated, and in z. mobilis, it depends on growth conditions. the putative presence of a homolog of grp in e. coli is discussed.

TI  == improved strains of recombinant escherichia coli for ethanol production from sugar mixtures.
AB  == hemicellulose hydrolysates of agricultural residues often contain mixtures of hexose and pentose sugars. ethanologenic escherichia coli that have been previously investigated preferentially ferment hexose sugars. in some cases, xylose fermentation was slow or incomplete. the purpose of this study was to develop improved ethanologenic e. coli strains for the fermentation of pentoses in sugar mixtures. using fosfomycin as a selective agent, glucose-negative mutants of e. coli ko11 (containing chromosomally integrated genes encoding the ethanol pathway from zymomonas mobilis) were isolated that were unable to ferment sugars transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. these strains (sl31 and sl142) retained the ability to ferment sugars with independent transport systems such as arabinose and xylose and were used to  ferment pentose sugars to ethanol selectively in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. additional fosfomycin-resistant mutants were isolated  that were superior to strain ko11 for ethanol production from hexose and pentose  sugars. these hyperproductive strains (sl28 and sl40) retained the ability to metabolize all sugars tested, completed fermentations more rapidly, and achieved  higher ethanol yields than the parent. both sl28 and sl40 produced 60 gl-1 ethanol from 120 gl-1 xylose in 60 h, 20% more ethanol than ko11 under identical  conditions. further studies illustrated the feasibility of sequential fermentation. a mixture of hexose and pentose sugars was fermented with near theoretical yield by sl40 in the first step followed by a second fermentation in  which yeast and glucose were added. such a two-step approach can combine the attributes of ethanologenic e. coli for pentoses with the high ethanol tolerance  of conventional yeasts in a single vessel.

TI  == imidazole acetol phosphate aminotransferase in zymomonas mobilis: molecular genetic, biochemical, and evolutionary analyses.
AB  == hish encodes imidazole acetol phosphate (iap) aminotransferase in zymomonas mobilis and is located immediately upstream of tyrc, a gene which codes for cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. a plasmid containing hish was able to complement an escherichia coli histidine auxotroph which lacked the homologous aminotransferase. dna sequencing of hish revealed an open reading frame of 1,110  bp, encoding a protein of 40,631 da. the cloned hish product was purified from e. coli and estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to have a molecular mass of 40,000 da. since the native enzyme had a molecular mass of 85,000 da as determined by gel filtration, the active enzyme species must be a homodimer. the purified enzyme was able to transaminate aromatic amino acids and histidine in addition to histidinol phosphate. the existence of a single protein having broad substrate specificity was consistent with the constant ratio of activities obtained with different substrates following a variety of physical  treatments (such as freeze-thaw, temperature inactivation, and manipulation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate content). the purified enzyme did not require addition of  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, but dependence upon this cofactor was demonstrated following resolution of the enzyme and cofactor by hydroxylamine treatment. kinetic data showed the classic ping-pong mechanism expected for aminotransferases. km values of 0.17, 3.39, and 43.48 mm for histidinol phosphate, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were obtained. the gene structure around hish-tyrc suggested an operon organization. the hish-tyrc cluster in z. mobilis is reminiscent of the hish-tyra component of a complex operon in bacillus subtilis, which includes the tryptophan operon and aroe. multiple alignment of all aminotransferase sequences available in the database showed that within the class i superfamily of aminotransferases, iap aminotransferases (family i beta) are closer to the i gamma family (e.g., rat tyrosine aminotransferase) than to the i alpha family (e.g., rat aspartate aminotransferase or e. coli aspc). signature motifs which distinguish the iap aminotransferase family were identified in the region of the active-site lysine and in the region of the interdomain interface.

AB  == the zymomonas mobilis gene sacc that encodes the extracellular sucrase (protein b46) was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the gene was found to be present downstream to the already described levansucrase gene sacb in the cloned  chromosomal fragment of z. mobilis. the expression product was different from sacb and exhibited sucrase but not levansucrase activity; therefore, sacc behaves like a true sucrase. expression of sacc in e. coli jm109 and xl1 was very low; overexpression was observed in e. coli bl21 after induction of the t7 polymerase  expression system with iptg. subcellular fractionation of the e. coli clone carrying plasmid plss2811 showed that more than 70% of the sucrase activity could be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that the enzyme was soluble and not secreted in e. coli. the nucleotide sequence analysis of sacc revealed an open reading frame 1239bp long coding for a 413 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46 kda. the first 30 deduced amino acids from this orf were identical with those from the n-terminal sequence of the extracellular sucrase (protein b46) purified from z. mobilis zm4. no leader peptide sequence could be identified in the sacc gene. the amino acid sequence of sacc showed very little similarity to those of other known sucrases, but was very similar to the levansucrases of z. mobilis (61.5%), erwinia amylovora (40.2%) and bacillus subtilis (25.6%).

TI  == characterization of the zymomonas mobilis glucose facilitator gene product (glf)  in recombinant escherichia coli: examination of transport mechanism, kinetics and the role of glucokinase in glucose transport.
AB  == zymomonas mobilis is known to transport glucose by a facilitated diffusion process. a putative glucose facilitator gene (glf), closely related to a large family of glucose transporters, is located in a cluster of genes that code for enzymes of glucose metabolism. the z. mobilis glf gene is able to complement glucose transport in an escherichia coli strain that is defective in native glucose transport and glucokinase. in this study, the recombinant e. coli was shown to be capable of influx counterflow when preloaded with glucose and had an  apparent km for glucose of approximately 1.1-2.9 mm, consistent with the function of glf as a low-affinity glucose facilitator. the ability of glucokinase mutants  expressing glf to transport glucose made it clear that glucokinase activity was not required for glf-dependent glucose transport. the possibility that glucokinase can interact with glf to improve the affinity for glucose was not supported since expression of the z. mobilis glucokinase gene, in addition to glf, did not affect the km of glf for glucose in recombinant e. coli. the inability of various sugars to compete with glucose during glucose transport by recombinant e. coli expressing glf indicated that glf is specific for glucose. while the results of fructose transport assays did not completely rule out the possibility of very low affinity for fructose, the apparent specificity of glf for glucose makes it possible that z. mobilis utilizes a different transporter(s) for fructose.

AB  == this study compared the anaerobic catabolism of glucose and xylose by a patented, recombinant ethanologenic escherichia coli b 11303:ploi297 in terms of overall yields of cell mass (growth), energy (atp), and end product (ethanol). batch cultivations were conducted with ph-controlled stirred-tank bioreactors using both a nutritionally rich, complex medium (luria broth) and a defined salts minimal medium and growth-limiting concentrations of glucose or xylose. the value of gamma atp was determined to be 9.28 and 8.19 g dry wt cells/mol atp in complex and minimal media, respectively. assuming that the nongrowth-associated energy demand is similar for glucose and xylose, the mass-based growth yield (yx/s, g dry wt cells/g sugar) should be proportional to the net energy yield from sugar metabolism. the value of yx/s was reduced, on average, by about 50% (from 0.096 g/g glu to 0.51 g/g xyl) when xylose replaced glucose as the growth-limiting carbon and energy source. it was concluded that this observation is consistent with the theoretical difference in net energy (atp) yield associated with anaerobic catabolism of glucose and xylose when differences in the mechanisms of  energy-coupled transport of each sugar are taken into account. in a defined salts medium, the net atp yield was determined to be 2.0 and 0.92 for glucose and xylose, respectively.

AB  == zymomonas mobilis is unique among bacteria in its ability to produce high levels  of ethanol (etoh) during fermentation. elevated etoh concentration, like elevated temperature, is a microbial stress and a universal inducer of stress proteins. for z. mobilis, exposure to high levels of etoh represents a natural stress. by using a simple strategy which combines the genetic tools of escherichia coli and  bacillus subtilis, we have cloned genes encoding two of the most abundant stress  proteins in z. mobilis, groes and groel. both genes were expressed at high levels in e. coli. despite the unique environment (etoh concentrations of above 10%) in  which the translated products from these genes function in z. mobilis, the amino-acid sequences encoded were remarkably similar to their homologues from bacteria which are not known to accumulate etoh. two small regions were observed, however, which appear more similar to saccharomyces cerevisiae hsp60 (groel homologue) than to e. coli or the concensus. these may be related to etoh tolerance.

TI  == two genes for carbohydrate catabolism are divergently transcribed from a region of dna containing the hexc locus in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1.
AB  == the hexc locus of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 was localized to a 247-bp segment of chromosomal dna on the multicopy broad-host-range vector pro1614. the presence of this plasmid (ppz196) in strain pao1 produced the so-called "hexc effect," a two- to ninefold increase in the activities of four carbohydrate catabolism enzymes, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. the extent of the hexc effect was restricted, since three independently regulated metabolic enzymes were not affected by the presence of the hexc plasmid. furthermore, the hexc-containing plasmid did not suppress catabolite repression control. nucleotide sequence analysis of the segment of dna encompassing hexc revealed a 128-bp region rich in adenosine-plus-thymine (at) content separating two divergent open reading frames (orfs). transcriptional start sites for these two genes were mapped to the intergenic region, demonstrating that this sequence contained overlapping divergent promoters. the intergenic region contained potential regulatory sequences such as dyad symmetry motifs, polydeoxyadenosine tracts, and a sequence matching the integration host factor recognition site in escherichia coli. one of the orfs encoded a 610-amino-acid protein with 55 to 60% identity to 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase from e. coli and zymomonas mobilis. the second orf coded for a protein of 335 amino acids that displayed 45 to 60% identity to the nad-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap) family of enzymes. the nad-dependent gap gene on the p. aeruginosa chromosome was previously unmapped. gap was found to exhibit the hexc-dependent increase in its  basal activity, establishing it as a fifth catabolic enzyme in the multioperonic  hex regulon.

AB  == the dna sequence of a 225.4 kilobase segment of the escherichia coli k-12 genome  is described here, from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes on the genetic map. this brings the  total of contiguous sequence from the e.coli genome project to 725.1 kb (76.0 to  92.8 minutes). we found 191 putative coding genes (orfs) of which 72 genes were previously known, and 110 of which remain unidentified despite literature and similarity searches. seven new genes--arse, arsf, arsg, tref, xylr, xylg, and xylh--were identified as well as the previously mapped pit and dcta genes. the arrangement of proposed genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 90 potential transcription units. other features include 19 rep elements, 95 computer-predicted bends, 50 chi sites, and one grey hole. thirty-one putative signal peptides were found, including those of thirteen known membrane or periplasmic proteins. one trna gene (prok) and two insertion sequences (is5 and is150) are located in this segment. the genes in this region are organized with equal numbers oriented with or against replication.

TI  == characterization and sequence of phoc, the principal phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase of morganella morganii.
AB  == phosphatase activities were investigated in morganella morganii, which is one of  the few enterobacterial species producing high-level phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase activity (hpap phenotype), and the gene encoding the major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase was cloned, sequenced, and its product characterized. using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, morganella produced a  major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named phoc) which is associated with the hpap phenotype, a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase, and a  phosphate-repressible alkaline phosphatase. the presence of the phoc activity prevented induction of alkaline phosphatase when a phoc-hydrolysable organic phosphate ester, such as glycerol 2-phosphate, was the sole phosphate source. phoc is a secreted nonspecific acid phosphatase apparently composed of four 25 kda polypeptide subunits. the enzyme is resistant to edta, p(i), fluoride and tartrate. the m. morganii phoc showed 84.6% amino acid sequence identity to the phon nonspecific acid phosphatase of providencia stuartii, 45.3% to the phon nonspecific acid phosphatase of salmonella typhimurium, and 37.8% to the principal acid phosphatase (phoc) of zymomonas mobilis. comparison of sequence data and of regulation of these enzymes suggested a different phylogeny of members of this gene family within the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction-based random mutagenesis: production and characterization of thermostable mutants of zymomonas mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase-2.
AB  == the adhb gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase-2 from zymomonas mobilis has been subjected to random mutagenesis to obtain more thermostable variants of the enzyme. random mutagenesis was accomplished using the polymerase chain reaction in mutagenic conditions. the optimum conditions involved restricting the concentration of one nucleotide to approximately one-tenth the normal amount. this introduced mutations at an average rate of 1 base in 600 in a 30-cycle pcr,  sufficient to ensure that the majority of encoding dna sequences in the mutant library have at least one base change from wild-type. seven thermostable mutants  were isolated from one library screening of 3000 colonies; two of these were selected for detailed study and purified using dye-ligand chromatography. mutant  ts-1 (f9s, v295a) was 3 degrees c more stable than the wild-type and had altered  kinetic characteristics, with reduced affinity for ethanol and acetaldehyde and reduced ethanol oxidation vmax. mutant ts-2 (m13i, e19k, m192i) also had increased thermostability of 3 to 4 degrees c, but its kinetic characteristics were similar to that of the wild-type. of the base changes found after sequencing a wide selection of mutants, 90% were transitions and 10% were transversions. included were several t to c base changes which did not correspond with the nucleotide limitation used to create the mutant libraries.

TI  == molecular cloning and sequence analysis of an azospirillum brasilense indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase gene.
AB  == azospirillum brasilense isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants has the ability to excrete indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) into the culture media. cosmid p0.2, isolated from an a. brasilense sp245 genome library in plafr1, complements  the tn5-induced mutant spm7918 of a. brasilense sp6 which excretes reduced amounts of iaa. restriction mapping and gene expression studies identified a bglii-ecori 4.3 kb fragment of p0.2 sufficient for the restoration of high levels of iaa production in mutant spm7918. tn5 mutagenesis localized the gene responsible on a 1.8 kb smai fragment. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains one complete open reading frame. the predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase of enterobacter cloacae and the pyruvate decarboxylases of saccharomyces cerevisiae  and zymomonas mobilis. the a. brasilense mutant sp245a, constructed by homogenotization of a tn5 insertion derivative of the 1.8 kb smai fragment, also  displayed reduced iaa production. introduction of the cloned wild-type gene into  rhizobium meliloti 1021 resulted in increased iaa production. cell-free extracts  prepared from r. meliloti and a. brasilense transconjugants harboring this gene could convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol. these results clearly demonstrate that iaa production in a. brasilense is mediated by indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase.

TI  == investigation of the cofactor-binding site of zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  == several enzymes require thiamin diphosphate (thdp) as an essential cofactor, and  we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc; ec 4.1.1.1) from zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. it is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification and its simple kinetic properties. a sequence motif of approx. 30 residues, beginning with a glycine-aspartate-glycine (-gdg-) triplet and ending with a double asparagine (-nn-) sequence, has been identified in many of these enzymes [hawkins, borges and perham (1989) febs lett. 255, 77-82]. other residues within this putative thdp-binding motif are conserved, but to a lesser extent, including a glutamate and a proline residue. the role of the elements of this motif has been clarified  by the determination of the three-dimensional structure of three of these enzymes [muller, lindqvist, furey, schulz, jordan and schneider (1993) structure 1, 95-103]. four of the residues within this motif were modified by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned pdc gene to evaluate their role in cofactor binding. the mutant proteins were expressed in escherichia coli and found to purify normally, indicating that the tertiary structure of these enzymes had not been grossly perturbed by the amino acid substitutions. we have shown previously [diefenbach, candy, mattick and duggleby (1992) febs lett. 296, 95-98] that changing the aspartate in the -gdg- sequence to glycine, threonine or asparagine  yields an inactive enzyme that is unable to bind thdp, therefore verifying the role of the thdp-binding motif. here we demonstrate that substitution with glutamate yields an active enzyme with a greatly reduced affinity for both thdp and mg2+, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. unlike the wild-type tetrameric  enzyme, this mutant protein usually exists as a dimer. replacement of the second  asparagine of the -nn- sequence by glutamine also yields an inactive enzyme which is unable to bind thdp, whereas replacement with an aspartate residue results in  an active enzyme with a reduced affinity for thdp but which displays normal kinetics for both mg2+ and pyruvate. replacing the conserved glutamate with aspartate did not alter the properties of the enzyme, while the conserved proline, thought to be required for structural reasons, could be substituted with glycine or alanine without inactivating the enzyme, but these changes did reduce  its stability.

TI  == metal-catalyzed oxidation of fe2+ dehydrogenases. consensus target sequence between propanediol oxidoreductase of escherichia coli and alcohol dehydrogenase  ii of zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == we have studied two enzymes of a newly described family of dehydrogenases with high sequence homology, 1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase of escherichia coli and alcohol dehydrogenase ii of zymomonas mobilis. these enzymes perform their metabolic role under anaerobic conditions; in the presence of oxygen, they show a very similar inactivation pattern by a metal-catalyzed oxidation system. titration of histidine residues with diethyl pyrocarbonate showed one histidine residue less in the oxidized enzymes. comparison of subtilisin peptide maps of active and inactivated enzymes showed a difference in one histidine-containing peptide, the sequence of which is yntph277gvan for propanediol oxidoreductase and ynlph277gv for alcohol dehydrogenase ii. this histidine residue lies 10 residues  away from a proposed metal-binding site, h263xxxh267, necessary to explain a site-specific free radical mechanism. the three histidine residues here described are strictly conserved in all enzymes of this family. in this report we propose that histidine 277 is a target for oxidation by a metal-catalyzed oxidation system and that this modification leads to the irreversible inactivation of both  enzymes.

TI  == molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  == there is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. they display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. they can be divided into three  major categories. (1) the nad- or nadp-dependent dehydrogenases. these can in turn be divided into the group i long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases i, ii, and iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida; the group ii short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of klebsiella aerogenes; the group iii "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase ii of zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase iv of saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900  residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of escherichia coli and clostridium acetobutylicum. the aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of a. methanolica and mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-n,n-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) nad(p)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor f420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of acetobacter and gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) oxidases that catalyze  an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi  involved in lignin degradation. this review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. the discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. the physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.

TI  == molecular analysis of the erwinia chrysanthemi region containing the kdga and zwf genes.
AB  == the pathways of pectin and galacturonate catabolism in erwinia chrysanthemi converge to form a common intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which is phosphorylated to form 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (kdgp) and then cleaved  by the aldolase encoded by the kdga gene. we cloned the kdga gene of the e. chrysanthemi strain 3937 by complementing an escherichia coli kdga mutation, using an rp4-derivative plasmid. restriction mapping of the kdga region and isolation of kdga-lac fusions allowed the more precise localization of the kdga gene and determination of its transcriptional direction. the nucleotide sequence  of the kdga region indicated that the kdga reading frame is 639 bases long, corresponding to a protein of 213 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22,187 da. comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the e. chrysanthemi kdgp-aldolase to the e. coli, zymomonas mobilis and pseudomonas putida enzymes showed that they are highly conserved. the e. chrysanthemi kdga structural gene begins 153 bases downstream of an open reading frame that has a high homology with the zwf e. coli gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. the zwf gene is also linked to eda (kdga) in e. coli and p. putida but genetic organization is different. regulation of zwf and kdga expression in e. chrysanthemi was analysed using lacz fusions. the expression of zwf is independent of the growth rate, but is repressed in the presence of glucose. induction of kdga by pectin-degradation products is mediated in vivo by the negative regulatory gene kdgr, which also controls all the steps of pectin degradation.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria: a novel pathway for the early steps leading  to isopentenyl diphosphate.
AB  == incorporation of 13c-labelled glucose, acetate, pyruvate or erythrose allowed the determination of the origin of the carbon atoms of triterpenoids of the hopane series and/or of the ubiquinones from several bacteria (zymomonas mobilis, methylobacterium fujisawaense, escherichia coli and alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris) confirmed our earlier results obtained by incorporation of 13c-labelled acetate into the hopanoids of other bacteria and led to the identification of a novel biosynthetic route for the early steps of isoprenoid biosynthesis. the c5 framework of isoprenic units results most probably (i) from  the condensation of a c2 unit derived from pyruvate decarboxylation (e.g. thiamine-activated acetaldehyde) on the c-2 carbonyl group of a triose phosphate  derivative issued probably from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and not from pyruvate  and (ii) from a transposition step. although this hypothetical biosynthetic pathway resembles that of l-valine biosynthesis, this amino acid or its c5 precursors could be excluded as intermediates in the formation of isoprenic units.

TI  == isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria: two different pathways?
AB  == the biosynthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate, a central intermediate of isoprenoid formation, was investigated in six different bacterial organisms. cell-free extracts of myxococcus fulvus, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus plantarum and halobacterium cutirubrum converted [14c]acetyl-coa or [14c]hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa to [14c]mevalonic acid. furthermore, [14c]mevalonic acid, [14c]mevalonate-5-phosphate and [14c]mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate were metabolized to [14c]isopentenylpyrophosphate. these data demonstrated the in vitro operation of  acetoacetate pathway for the formation of isopentenylpyrophosphate in bacteria. in contrast, no intermediates of this reaction sequence could be detected using cell-free extracts of zymomonas mobilis and escherichia coli. these results indicate that at least two different pathways for the biosynthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate are present in bacteria.

TI  == the aroq-encoded monofunctional chorismate mutase (cm-f) protein is a periplasmic enzyme in erwinia herbicola.
AB  == enteric bacteria possess two species of chorismate mutase which exist as catalytic domains on the amino termini of the bifunctional phea and tyra proteins. in addition, some of these organisms possess a third chorismate mutase, cm-f, which exists as a small monofunctional protein. the cm-f gene (denoted aroq) from erwinia herbicola was cloned and sequenced for the first time. a strategy for selection by functional complementation in a chorismate mutase-free  escherichia coli background was devised by using a recombinant plasmid derivative of puc18 carrying a zymomonas mobilis tyrc insert which encodes cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. the aroq gene is 543 bp in length, predicting a 181-residue protein product having a calculated molecular mass of 20,299 da. the e. herbicola aroq promoter is recognized by e. coli, and a putative sigma-70 promoter region was identified. n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified cm-f protein indicated cleavage of a 20-residue signal peptide. this was consistent with the monomeric molecular mass determined for the enzyme of about 18,000 da. the native enzyme is a homodimer. the implied translocation of cm-f was confirmed by osmotic shock experiments which demonstrated a periplasmic location. immunogold electron  microscopy indicated a polar localization within the periplasm. polyclonal antibody raised against e. herbicola cm-f did not cross-react with the cm-f protein from the closely related serratia rubidaea, as well as from a number of other gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, when the e. herbicola aroq gene was used as a probe in southern blot hybridizations with ecrori digests of chromosomal dna from s. rubidaea and other enteric organisms, no hybridization was detected at low stringency. thus, the aroq gene appears to be unusually divergent among closely related organisms. the deduced cm-f amino acid sequence did not exhibit compelling evidence for homology with the monofunctional chorismate mutase protein of bacillus subtilis.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the zymomonas mobilis phosphoglycerate mutase gene (pgm) in escherichia coli.
AB  == phosphoglycerate mutase is an essential glycolytic enzyme for zymomonas mobilis,  catalyzing the reversible interconversion of 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate. the pgm gene encoding this enzyme was cloned on a 5.2-kbp dna fragment and expressed in escherichia coli. recombinants were identified by using antibodies directed against purified z. mobilis phosphoglycerate mutase. the pgm  gene contains a canonical ribosome-binding site, a biased pattern of codon usage, a long upstream untranslated region, and four promoters which share sequence homology. interestingly, adha and a d-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase were found on the same dna fragment and appear to form a cluster of genes which function in central metabolism. the translated sequence for z. mobilis pgm was in full agreement with the 40 n-terminal amino acid residues determined by protein sequencing. the primary structure of the translated sequence is highly conserved  (52 to 60% identity with other phosphoglycerate mutases) and also shares extensive homology with bisphosphoglycerate mutases (51 to 59% identity). since southern blots indicated the presence of only a single copy of pgm in the z. mobilis chromosome, it is likely that the cloned pgm gene functions to provide both activities. z. mobilis phosphoglycerate mutase is unusual in that it lacks the flexible tail and lysines at the carboxy terminus which are present in the enzyme isolated from all other organisms examined.

TI  == mutational analysis of segmental stabilization of transcripts from the zymomonas  mobilis gap-pgk operon.
AB  == in zymomonas mobilis, the genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase are transcribed together from the gap-pgk operon. however, higher levels of the former enzyme are present in the cytoplasm because  of increased stability of a 5' segment containing the gap coding region. this segment is bounded by an upstream untranslated region which can be folded into many stem-loop structures and a prominent intercistronic stem-loop. mutations eliminating a proposed stem-loop in the untranslated region or the intercistronic stem-loop resulted in a decrease in the stability and pool size of the 5' gap segment. site-specific mutations in the unpaired regions of both of these stems also altered the message pools. elimination of the intercistronic stem appeared to reduce the endonucleolytic cleavage within the pgk coding region, increasing the stability and abundance of the full-length message. dna encoding the prominent stem-loop at the 3' end of the message was shown to be a transcriptional terminator both in z. mobilis and in escherichia coli. this third stem-loop region (part of the transcriptional terminator) was required to stabilize the full-length gap-pgk message.

TI  == an allosterically insensitive class of cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == the key enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis in many gram-negative prokaryotes is cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. the zymomonas mobilis gene (tyrc) coding for this  enzyme was cloned in escherichia coli by complementation of a tyrosine auxotroph. the tyrc gene was 882 bp long, encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 32086 da. the z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase expressed in e. coli was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. the subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 32 kda as determined by sds/page. the ratio of the activity of arogenate dehydrogenase to that of prephenate dehydrogenase (approximately 3:1) remained constant throughout purification, and the two activities were therefore inseparable. the genetic and biochemical data obtained  demonstrated a single enzyme protein capable of catalyzing either of two reactions. km values of 0.25 mm and 0.18 mm were obtained from prephenate and l-arogenate, respectively. the km value obtained for nad+ (0.09 mm) was the same  regardless of whether the enzyme was assayed as arogenate dehydrogenase or as prephenate dehydrogenase. unlike the corresponding enzyme of pseudomonas aeruginosa or e. coli, the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase of z. mobilis lacks sensitivity to feedback inhibition by l-tyrosine. a typical nad(+)-binding domain was found to be located at the n-terminus of the protein. although the deduced amino-acid sequence of the z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase showed relatively low identity (19-32%) with the prephenate dehydrogenases of bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as with the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase components of the bifunctional t-proteins of e. coli and erwinia herbicola, a presumptive motif was identified which may correspond to critical residues of the binding site for cyclohexadienyl substrate molecules. immediately upstream of tryc a portion of a gene was sequenced and found to exhibit clearcut  homology of the deduced amino-acid sequence with the b. subtilis hish gene product. thus, the zymomonas gene organization is reminiscent of the linkage of genes encoding a tryosine-pathway dehydrogenase and a histidine-pathway aminotransferase in b. subtilis.

AB  == the zymomonas mobilis lig gene that encodes dna ligase was cloned from a cosmid library and identified by genetic complementation of a conditional-lethal escherichia coli dna ligase mutant. nucleotide sequence analysis of the z. mobilis lig region indicated that the gene is 2196 bp long, encoding a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 82,089. the primary amino acid sequence of the z. mobilis ligase is 48% identical to the e. coli enzyme. two genes located upstream of lig were identified as tgt, encoding trna guanine transglycosylase and uvrb, encoding the beta subunit of excision endonuclease. computer searches did not reveal any transcriptional terminators in the 46-bp tgt-lig intergenic region, suggesting that lig may be cotranscribed with one or more upstream genes. weak expression of lig is explained in part by frequent use of codons that are known to be rarely used in the highly expressed glycolytic gene set.

TI  == the entner-doudoroff pathway: history, physiology and molecular biology.
AB  == the entner-doudoroff pathway is now known to be very widely distributed in nature. biochemical and physiological studies show that the entner-doudoroff pathway can operate in a linear and catabolic mode, in a 'cyclic' mode, in a modified mode involving non-phosphorylated intermediates, or in alternative modes involving c1 metabolism and anabolism. molecular and genetic analyses of the entner-doudoroff pathway in zymomonas mobilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa have led to an improved understanding of some fundamental aspects of metabolic controls. it can be argued that the entner-doudoroff pathway is more primitive than embden-meyerhof-parnas glycolysis.

TI  == molecular characterization of the entner-doudoroff pathway in escherichia coli: sequence analysis and localization of promoters for the edd-eda operon.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the entire escherichia coli edd-eda region that encodes the enzymes of the entner-doudoroff pathway was determined. the edd structural gene begins 236 bases downstream of zwf. the eda structural gene begins 34 bases downstream of edd. the edd reading frame is 1,809 bases long and  encodes the 602-amino-acid, 64,446-da protein 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the e. coli and zymomonas mobilis dehydratase enzymes are highly conserved. the eda reading frame is 642 bases long and encodes the 213-amino-acid, 22,283-da protein 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. this enzyme had been previously purified and sequenced by others on the basis of its related enzyme activity, 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase. the data presented here provide proof that the two enzymes are identical. the primary amino acid sequences of the e. coli, z. mobilis, and pseudomonas putida aldolase enzymes are highly conserved. when e. coli is grown on gluconate, the edd and eda genes are cotranscribed. four putative promoters within the edd-eda region were identified by transcript mapping and computer analysis. p1, located upstream of edd, appears to be the primary gluconate-responsive promoter of the edd-eda operon, responsible for induction of the entner-doudoroff pathway, as mediated by the gntr product. high  basal expression of eda is explained by constitutive transcription from p2, p3, and/or p4 but not p1.

TI  == fermentation of sweet whey by ethanologenic escherichia coli.
AB  == whey, an abundant byproduct of the dairy industry, contains large amounts of protein and lactose which could be used for fuel ethanol production. we have investigated a new organism as a candidate for such fermentations: recombinant escherichia coli containing the genes encoding the ethanol pathway from zymomonas mobilis. the highest level of ethanol achieved, 68 g/l, was produced after 108 hours in luria broth containing 140 g lactose/l. fermentations of lower lactose concentrations were completed more rapidly with approximately 88% of theoretical  yields. reconstituted sweet whey (60 g lactose/l)was fermented more slowly than lactose in luria broth requiring 144 hours to produce 26 g ethanol/l. supplementing sweet whey with a trace metal mix and ammonium sulfate reduced the  required fermentation time to 72 hours and increased final ethanol concentration  (28 g ethanol/l). by adding proteinases during fermentation, the requirement for  ammonia was completely eliminated, and the rate of fermentation further improved  (30 g ethanol/l after 48 hours). this latter increased in rate of ethanol production and ethanol yield are presumed to result from incorporation of amino acids released by hydrolysis of whey proteins. the fermentation of sweet whey by  ethanologenic e. coil reduced the nonvolatile residue by approximately 70%. this  should reduce biological oxygen demand and reduce the cost of waste treatment. whey supplemented with trace metals and small amounts of proteinase may represent an economically attractive feedstock for the production of ethanol and other useful chemicals.

AB  == the frk gene encoding the enzyme fructokinase (fructose 6-phosphotransferase [ec  2.7.1.4]) from zymomonas mobilis has been isolated on a partial taqi digest fragment of the genome and sequenced. an open reading frame of 906 bp corresponding to 302 amino acids was identified on a 3-kbp taqi fragment. the deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to the first 20 amino acids (including an n-terminal methionine) determined by amino acid sequencing of the purified protein. the 118 bp preceding the methionine codon on this fragment does not appear to contain a promoter sequence. there was weak expression of the active enzyme in the recombinant escherichia coli clone under control of the lac promoter on the puc plasmid. comparison of the amino acid sequence with that of the glucokinase enzyme (ec 2.7.1.2) from z. mobilis reveals relatively little homology, despite the fact that fructokinase also binds glucose and has kinetic and structural properties similar to those of glucokinase. also, there is little  homology with hexose kinases that have been sequenced from other organisms. northern (rna) blot analysis showed that the frk transcript is 1.2 kb long. fructokinase activity is elevated up to twofold when z. mobilis was grown on fructose instead of glucose, and there was a parallel increase in frk mrna levels. differential mrna stability was not a factor, since the half-lives of the frk transcript were 6.2 min for glucose-grown cells and 6.6 min for fructose-grown cells.

TI  == effects of substitution of aspartate-440 and tryptophan-487 in the thiamin diphosphate binding region of pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == a tryptophan residue at position 487 in zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase  was altered to leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. this modified z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase was active when expressed in escherichia coli and had unchanged kinetics towards pyruvate. the enzyme showed a decreased affinity for the cofactors with the half-saturating concentrations increasing from 0.64 to 9.0 microm for thiamin diphosphate and from 4.21 to 45 microm for mg2+. unlike the wild-type enzyme, there was little quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon adding cofactors to this modified form. the data suggest that tryptophan-487 is close to the cofactor binding site but is not required absolutely for pyruvate decarboxylase activity. substitution of asparagine, threonine or glycine for aspartate-440, a residue which is conserved between many thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes, completely abolishes enzyme activity.

TI  == effect of acetic acid on xylose conversion to ethanol by genetically engineered e. coli.
AB  == efficient utilization of the pentosan fraction of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic feedstocks offers an opportunity to increase the yield and to reduce the cost of producing fuel ethanol. during prehydrolysis (acid hydrolysis  or autohydrolysis of hemicellulose), acetic acid is formed as a consequence of the deacetylation of the acetylated moiety of hemicellulose. recombinant escherichia coli b (atcc 11303), carrying the plasmid plo1297 with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase ii genes from zymomonas mobilis (cp4), converts xylose to ethanol with a product yield that approaches theoretical maximum. although other pentose-utilizing microorganisms are inhibited by acetic  acid, the recombinant e. coli displays a high tolerance for acetic acid. in xylose fermentations with a synthetic medium (luria broth), where the ph was controlled at 7, neither yield nor productivity was affected by the addition of 10.7 g/l acetic acid. nutrient-supplemented, hardwood (aspen) hemicellulose hydrolysate (40.7 g/l xylose) was completely fermented to ethanol (16.3 g/l) in 98 h. when the acetic acid concentration was reduced from 5.6 to 0.8 g/l, the fermentation time decreased to 58 h. overliming, with ca(oh)2 to ph 10, followed  by neutralization to ph 7 with sulfuric acid and removal of insolubles, resulted  in a twofold increase in volumetric productivity. the maximum productivity was 0.93 g/l/h. the xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and productivity in ca(oh)2-treated hardwood prehydrolysate, fortified with only mineral salts, were  94% and 0.26 g/l/h, respectively. the recombinant e. coli exhibits a xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency that is superior to that of other pentose-utilizing yeasts currently being investigated for the production of fuel  ethanol from lignocellulosic materials.

AB  == the eda gene that encodes 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of the entner-doudoroff pathway was cloned from zymomonas mobilis by genetic complementation of an escherichia coli mutant. the gene is present in a single copy on the z. mobilis genome and is not tightly linked to the edd gene. nucleotide sequence analysis of the eda region revealed that the structural gene  is 627 bp long and capable of encoding a protein of 208 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 21,505. the eda gene is monocistronic and is transcribed from a single promoter. the transcriptional initiation site was determined and an improved consensus promoter sequence for z. mobilis was derived. high-level expression of the eda gene can be attributed to very efficient translational initiation caused by the high quality of the ribosome-binding site and stability of the mrna, which has a decay rate of 7.6 min. a comparison of highly expressed z. mobilis genes indicated that the relative quality of the ribosome-binding sites of these genes might play an important role in determining the level of enzyme synthesis. this possibility is  discussed with regard to the role of gene expression in co-ordinating the enzyme  levels of the entner-doudoroff glycolytic pathway.

TI  == segmental message stabilization as a mechanism for differential expression from the zymomonas mobilis gap operon.
AB  == in zymomonas mobilis, three- to fourfold more glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein than phosphoglycerate kinase is needed for glycolysis because of differences in catalytic efficiency. consistent with this requirement, higher levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were observed with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the genes encoding these enzymes (gap and pgk, respectively) form a bicistronic operon, and some form of regulation is required to provide this differential expression. two transcripts were observed in northern rna analyses with segments of gap as a probe: a more abundant 1.2-kb transcript that contained gap alone and a 2.7-kb transcript that  contained both genes. based on the relative amounts of these transcripts, the coding regions for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were calculated to be fivefold more abundant than those for phosphoglycerate kinase. assuming equal translational efficiency, this is sufficient to provide the observed differences  in expression. operon fusions with lacz provided no evidence for intercistronic terminators or attenuation mechanisms. both gap operon messages were very stable, with half-lives of approximately 16 min (1.2-kb transcript) and 7 min (2.7-kb transcript). transcript mapping and turnover studies indicated that the shorter gap message was a stable degradation product of the full-length message. thus differential expression of gap and pgk results primarily from increased translation of the more stable 5' segment of the transcript containing gap. the slow turnover of the messages encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase is proposed as a major feature contributing to the high level of expression of these essential enzymes.

TI  == sequence and genetic organization of a zymomonas mobilis gene cluster that encodes several enzymes of glucose metabolism.
AB  == the zymomonas mobilis genes that encode glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf),  6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (edd), and glucokinase (glk) were cloned independently by genetic complementation of specific defects in escherichia coli  metabolism. the identity of these cloned genes was confirmed by various biochemical means. nucleotide sequence analysis established that these three genes are clustered on the genome and revealed an additional open reading frame in this region that has significant amino acid identity to the e. coli xylose-proton symporter and the human glucose transporter. on the basis of this evidence and structural analysis of the deduced primary amino acid sequence, this gene is believed to encode the z. mobilis glucose-facilitated diffusion protein,  glf. the four genes in the 6-kb cluster are organized in the order glf, zwf, edd, glk. the glf and zwf genes are separated by 146 bp. the zwf and edd genes overlap by 8 bp, and their expression may be translationally coupled. the edd and glk genes are separated by 203 bp. the glk gene is followed by tandem transcriptional terminators. the four genes appear to be organized in an operon. such an arrangement of the genes that govern glucose uptake and the first three steps of  the entner-doudoroff glycolytic pathway provides the organism with a mechanism for carefully regulating the levels of the enzymes that control carbon flux into  the pathway.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the saca gene: characterization of a sucrase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == the zymomonas mobilis gene (saca) encoding a protein with sucrase activity has been cloned in escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been determined.  potential ribosome-binding site and promoter sequences were identified in the region upstream of the gene which were homologous to e. coli and z. mobilis consensus sequences. extracts from e. coli cells, containing the saca gene, displayed a sucrose-hydrolyzing activity. however, no transfructosylation activity (exchange reaction or levan formation) could be detected. this sucrase activity was different from that observed with the purified extracellular protein b46 from z. mobilis. these two proteins showed different electrophoretic mobilities and molecular masses and shared no immunological similarity. thus, the product of saca (a polypeptide of 58.4-kda molecular mass) is a new sucrase from  z. mobilis. the amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of saca, showed strong homologies with the sucrases from bacillus subtilis, salmonella typhimurium, and vibrio alginolyticus.

AB  == a set of vectors was constructed for the cloning and expression of heterologous genes in the gram-negative bacterium zymomonas mobilis under the control of the pdc promoter of z. mobilis. the vectors pptz1, pptz3, and pptz4 are based on the  cryptic z. mobilis plasmid pzm02 and on parts of the escherichia coli plasmids pkk223-3 and pbr322 together with the multiple cloning site of phage m13mp18. dna fragments can be readily inserted immediately downstream from the pdc promoter at unique restriction sites for kpni, xbai and psti in pptz1 and additionally for smai and bamhi in pptz3. in pptz4, the 5' terminal codons of pdc were deleted allowing the formation of gene fusions. expression of a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) controlled by the pdc gene promoter  resulted in enzyme activities of up to 5.5 u/mg total cell protein in z. mobilis  cells.

TI  == cloning of the zymomonas mobilis structural gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase i (adha): sequence comparison and expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == zymomonas mobilis ferments sugars to produce ethanol with two biochemically distinct isoenzymes of alcohol dehydrogenase. the adha gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase i has now been sequenced and compared with the adhb gene, which encodes the second isoenzyme. the deduced amino acid sequences for these gene products exhibited no apparent homology. alcohol dehydrogenase i contained 337 amino acids, with a subunit molecular weight of 36,096. based on comparisons of primary amino acid sequences, this enzyme belongs to the family of zinc alcohol dehydrogenases which have been described primarily in eucaryotes. nearly all of the 22 strictly conserved amino acids in this group were also conserved in z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase i. alcohol dehydrogenase i is an abundant protein,  although adha lacked many of the features previously reported in four other highly expressed genes from z. mobilis. codon usage in adha is not highly biased  and includes many codons which were unused by pdc, adhb, gap, and pgk. the ribosomal binding region of adha lacked the canonical shine-dalgarno sequence found in the other highly expressed genes from z. mobilis. although these features may facilitate the expression of high enzyme levels, they do not appear  to be essential for the expression of z. mobilis adha.

TI  == activation of the lac genes of tn951 by insertion sequences from pseudomonas cepacia.
AB  == we have identified three transposable gene-activating elements from pseudomonas cepacia on the basis of their abilities to increase expression of the lac genes of the broad-host-range plasmid pgc91.14 (prp1::tn951). when introduced into auxotrophic derivatives of p. cepacia 249 (atcc 17616), this plasmid failed to confer the ability to utilize lactose. the lac genes of tn951 were poorly expressed in p. cepacia and were not induced by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. lac+ variants of the pgc91.14-containing  strains which formed beta-galactosidase at high constitutive levels as a consequence of transposition of insertion sequences from the p. cepacia genome to sites upstream of the lacz gene of tn951 were isolated. certain of the elements also increased gene expression in other bacteria. for example, is407 strongly activated the lacz gene of tn951 in pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli,  and is406 (but not is407) did so in zymomonas mobilis. the results indicate that  is elements from p. cepacia have potential for turning on the expression of foreign genes in a variety of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == transposable elements for efficient manipulation of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria: promoter probes and vectors for foreign genes.
AB  == we describe here the construction and use of a series of modified transposons based on the insertion sequence is1. like their parent, omegon-km [fellay et al., gene 76 (1989) 215-226], these elements permit efficient insertional mutagenesis  of a variety of gram-negative bacteria. the presence of a functional pbr322 origin of replication within the transposable element facilitates subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. the omegon-km system was previously shown to function in pseudomonas putida, rhizobium leguminosarum and paracoccus denitrificans. the results we present here demonstrate that its use can be extended to xanthomonas campestris, a plant pathogen, and to the microaeroduric zymomonas mobilis. derivative transposons carrying unique restriction sites for scai, ndei, xbai and xhoi have been constructed, allowing the cloning and introduction of foreign genes. we have also constructed two derivatives which can be used to generate operon fusions upon insertion and are thus useful for isolating and characterising indigenous promoters. one carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (cat)-encoding gene (cat) and the second, the  entire promoterless escherichia coli lac operon. we demonstrate the utility of the cat promoter probe in x. campestris to target conditional promoters inducible by high salt or subject to repression by glucose.

TI  == differential expression of gap and pgk genes within the gap operon of zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == in zymomonas mobilis, the genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap) and phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) are encoded in an operon that is transcribed from tandem promoters. the promoter-proximal gap gene is expressed at six- to ninefold higher levels than the pgk gene from chromosomal genes and from  multiple copies of plasmid-borne genes. two dominant transcripts were identified. the smaller, most abundant transcript contained primarily the gap message, whereas the larger, less abundant message contained both genes. the ratio of message levels for gap and pgk was calculated to be 5:1 and is sufficient to account for the observed differences in levels of gap and pgk. the differences in message abundance are proposed to result from either transcriptional attenuation  or preferential degradation of the 3' region encoding pgk. increases in gene dosage were accompanied by one-third the expected increase in enzymatic activity  on the basis of estimates of copy number, consistent with the presence of a limiting, positive regulatory factor. however, gap and pgk expressions were not reduced from the chromosome in recombinants that contained multiple copies of the gap operon with inactive genes.

TI  == expression vector for zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == this study describes the construction of several useful cloning vectors which can be conjugated from escherichia coli into zymomonas mobilis at high frequency, approaching 10 per donor or recipient. these vectors contain a broad-host-range replicon and mob site from rsf1010, a chloramphenicol acyltransferase gene under  the control of an enteric consensus promoter, and a second mob site (originally derived from rp4). the addition of this second mob site appears to be responsible for a 2-order-of-magnitude increase in the efficiency of transfer into z. mobilis. such vectors may be useful for other gram-negative bacteria in which conjugation efficiencies are low. these vectors are stably maintained in z. mobilis with no detectable loss of plasmid after 50 generations in the absence of selective pressure. one of these, ploi193, contains the tetracycline gene from pbr322 and associated cloning sites for insertional inactivation. another, ploi204, contains a z. mobilis promoter immediately upstream from a bamhi site which can be used for cloning. this promoter has been shown to efficiently drive  the expression of beta-galactosidase in both z. mobilis and e. coli. this promoter fragment from z. mobilis has been sequenced, and the site for transcriptional initiation in e. coli and z. mobilis has been identified.

AB  == wild-type strains of zymomonas mobilis exhibit multiple antibiotic resistance and thus restrict the use of many broad-host-range plasmids in them as cloning vehicles. antibiotic-sensitive mutants of z. mobilis were isolated and used as hosts for the conjugal transfer of broad-host-range plasmids from escherichia coli. such antibiotic-sensitive strains can facilitate the application of broad-host-range plasmids to the study of z. mobilis.

TI  == isolation of noninhibitory strains of zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == wild-type zymomonas mobilis strains inhibit the growth of escherichia coli. we report the first isolation of noninhibitory strains, called zymomonas inhibition  negative (zin), after treatment with n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. a standardized soft-agar overlay procedure for detecting e. coli growth inhibition  was also developed.

TI  == transformation of zymomonas mobilis by a hybrid plasmid.
AB  == the transformation of zymomonas mobilis by plasmid dna was achieved using a modification of the cacl2 method for escherichia coli. the highest frequency of transformation obtained was 5 x 10(3) transformants/micrograms dna. the success of the method depended upon the use of a plasmid which is a cointegrate between a z. mobilis cryptic plasmid and an e. coli plasmid carrying two selectable drug resistance markers.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different zymomonas mobilis strains.
AB  == twenty different zymomonas mobilis strains were found to produce a substance which inhibited or killed various other zymomonas , escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. this antibacterial activity could  be detected in cross-streak tests and as zones of clearing in lawns of the test bacteria. when zymomonas strains are used as recipients in conjugation experiments, their antibacterial activity can be used to advantage for removal of unwanted donor cells from the mating mixtures.

TI  == self-transmissible plasmid in zymomonas mobilis carrying antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid prut41 from zymomonas mobilis was examined for its biological properties. this plasmid was found to be conjugally transferred from z. mobilis cp4 to escherichia coli bm21 and to carry genes for antibiotic resistance (gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin). covalently closed circular plasmid dna was isolated from eight transconjugants of e. coli bm21. these plasmids were identical in mobility on agarose gels and exhibited the same restriction patterns as the native prut41 plasmid isolated from z. mobilis. the plasmid location of the antibiotic resistance genes was further confirmed by transforming e. coli bm21 with isolated prut41 plasmid from strain cp4 and with plasmids from the transconjugants of bm21. resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin was tightly linked and transferred together in all cases.

TI  == expression of a lactose transposon (tn951) in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == the potential utility of zymomonas mobilis as an organism for the commercial production of ethanol would be greatly enhanced by the addition of foreign genes  which expand its range of fermentable substrates. we tested various plasmids and  mobilizing factors for their ability to act as vectors and introduce foreign genes into z. mobilis cp4. plasmid pgc91.14, a derivative of rp1, was found to be transferred from escherichia coli to z. mobilis at a higher frequency than previously reported for any other plasmids. both tetracycline resistance and the  lactose operon from this plasmid were expressed in z. mobilis cp4. plasmid pgc91.14 was stably maintained in z. mobilis at 30 degrees c but rapidly lost at  37 degrees c.

TI  == lipid composition of zymomonas mobilis: effects of ethanol and glucose.
AB  == zymomonas mobilis is an alcohol-tolerant microorganism which is potentially useful for the commercial production of ethanol. this organism was found to contain cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine as major phospholipids. vaccenic acid was the most abundant fatty acid, with lesser amounts of myristic, palmitic, and palmitoleic acids. no  branched-chain or cyclopropane fatty acids were found. previous studies in our laboratory have shown that ethanol induces the synthesis of phospholipids enriched in vaccenic acid in escherichia coli (l. o. ingram, j. bacteriol. 125:670-678, 1976). the fatty acid composition of z. mobilis, an obligately ethanol-producing microorganism, represents an extreme of the trend observed in e. coli. in z. mobilis, vaccenic acid represents over 75% of the acyl chains in the polar membrane lipids. glucose and ethanol had no major effect on the fatty acid composition of z. mobilis. however, both glucose and ethanol caused a decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol and an increase in  cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine. ethanol also caused a dose-dependent reduction in the lipid-to-protein ratios of crude membranes. the lipid composition of z. mobilis may represent an evolutionary adaptation for survival in the presence of ethanol.

TI  == high-productivity alcohol fermentations using zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == a process is under development at the university of new south wales to produce fermentation ethanol faster and more efficiently. the process is based on the micro-organism zymomonas mobilis, which has higher specific rates of ethanol production and higher yields when compared with the traditionally used yeasts. by using hollow fibre membranes for cell recycle, high productivity continuous processes have been studied at laboratory-scale. pilot scale evaluations (500 litres) are now in progress through licence agreements between the university and industry. genetic manipulation and recombinant dna techniques are being used to increase the ethanol tolerance and broaden the substrate range. most recently glucoamylase genes from aspergillus niger have been cloned into escherichia coli  k12 as part of a programme to enable direct fermentation of starch to ethanol by  z. mobilis.

TI  == r-plasmid transfer in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == conjugal transfer of three incp1 plasmids and one incfii plasmid into strains of  the ethanol-producing bacterium zymomonas mobilis was obtained. these plasmids were transferred at high frequencies from escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa into z. mobilis and also between different z. mobilis strains, using the membrane filter mating technique. most of the plasmids were stably maintained in z. mobilis, although there was some evidence of delayed marker expression. a low level of chromosomal gene transfer, mediated by plasmid r68.45, was detected  between z. mobilis strains. genetic evidence suggesting that z. mobilis may be more closely related to e. coli than to pseudomonas or rhizobium is discussed.
