TI == 16s rdna analysis of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens: phylogenetic position and relation to butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria from the rumen of white-tailed deer.
AB == complete 16s rdna sequences of six strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, including the type strain (atcc 19171), were determined. the type strain was found to have less than 89% sequence similarity to the other isolates that were examined. the five plasmid-bearing strains formed a closely related cluster and three of these strains (ob156, ob157 and ob192) were very highly related (> 99%), indicating that they are isolates of the same genomic species. the phylogenetic position of butyrivibrio was found to be within the subphylum clostridium, of gram-positive bacteria. the closest relatives to the type strain were eubacterium cellulosolvens and cl. xylanolyticum and the closest relatives to the separately clustered strains were roseburia ceciola, lachnospira pectinoschiza and eubacterium rectale.

TI == effects of lasalocid or monensin on lactate-producing or -using rumen bacteria.
AB == lasalocid or monensin inhibited most of the lactate-producing rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, eubacterium cellulosolvens, e. ruminantium, lachnospira multiparus, lactobacillus ruminis, l. vitulinus, ruminococcus albus, r. flavefaciens, streptococcus bovis). minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from .38 to 3.0 micrograms/ml. among the lactate producers, those that produce succinate as a major end product (bacteroides, selenomonas, succinimonas, succinivibrio) were not inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. also, none of the major lactate fermenters (anaerovibrio, megasphaera, selenomonas) was inhibited by lasalocid or monensin. veillonella alcalescens was inhibited by 24 micrograms/ml of lasalocid but was resistant to monensin. hence, the reported increase in propionate in lasalocid- or monensin-fed cattle may result from selection for succinate producers and lactate fermenters. lasalocid and monensin appeared to inhibit selectively the production of l(+), but not d(-) lactic acid. the inhibition of major lactate-producing bacteria (streptococcus and lactobacillus) suggests that lasalocid or monensin may be used to prevent lactic acidosis in ruminants.
