TI  == phylogenetic analysis of endophytic bacterial isolates from leaves of the medicinal plant trichilia elegans a. juss. (meliaceae).
AB  == various organisms such as fungi and bacteria can live inside plants, inhabiting the aerial parts (primarily the leaves) without causing damage. these microorganisms, called endophytes, produce an extensive variety of compounds that can be useful for medical and agronomic purposes. trichilia elegans a. juss., belonging to the meliaceae family, shows wide dispersion in south america, and phytochemical analyses from these plants and endophyte isolates have shown biological activity. accordingly, the aim of this study was to verify the diversity of bacterial endophytes from t. elegans using partial sequencing of 16s rrna, followed by phylogenetic analysis. isolation was performed by cutting the leaves, after disinfection with 5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), in 1-2-mm2 fragments, which were equally placed on dishes containing tsa and fungicide benlate at 75 mug/ml. all dishes were incubated at 28 degrees c in the biochemical oxygen demand system for 5 days and periodically checked. afterwards, the colonization frequency (%) was determined: (number of fragments colonized by  bacteria/total number of fragments) x 100. three isolations between september 2011 and march 2012 were performed; the growth frequency ranged between 1.6 and 13.6%. following sequencing of 16s rrna and phylogenetic analysis, the genera identified were: staphylococcus, bacillus, microbacterium, pseudomonas, and pantoea. these results will provide important knowledge on the diversity of endophytic bacteria inhabiting medicinal plants, and a better understanding of the microbiome of t. elegans would reinforce the necessity of endophyte studies with a focus on their future applications in biotechnological areas of agriculture, medicine, and the environment.

TI  == epiphytic and endophytic bacteria that promote growth of ethnomedicinal plants in the subtropical forests of meghalaya, india.
AB  == the present study was aimed to investigate the endophytic and epiphytic bacteria  associated with selected ethnomedicinal plants from the pristine subtropical forests of meghalaya and analyse them for plant growth promotion and antagonistic ability. this study is an attempt to explore plant associated bacteria which are  beneficial to host plants, and thus aid in the conservation of ethnomedicinal plants of the studied subtropical forests, which are dwindling due to exploitation. the plant growth promotion parameters like indole acetic acid (iaa) production, mineral phosphate solubilisation, acid phosphatase activity, presence of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (acc) gene, nitrogen fixation, cellulose digestion, chitin and pectin degrada- tion were screened among the isolates. the study revealed significant differences in bacterial population not  only between the epiphytic and endophytic microhabitats, but also amongst the host plants. out of the 70 isolated plant associated bacteria, bacillus sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas sp., pantoea sp., and lysinibacillus sp. showed potent  plant growth promotion properties. bacillus siamensis c53 and b. subtilis cenb showed significant antagonistic activity against the tested pathogens. this study indicated the isolates inhabiting the plants prevalent in the subtropical sacred  forests could be explored for use as plant growth promoters while practising the  cultiva- tion and conservation of ethnomedicinal plants.

TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == isolation and enzyme bioprospection of endophytic bacteria associated with plants of brazilian mangrove ecosystem.
AB  == the mangrove ecosystem is a coastal tropical biome located in the transition zone between land and sea that is characterized by periodic flooding, which confers unique and specific environmental conditions on this biome. in these ecosystems,  the vegetation is dominated by a particular group of plant species that provide a unique environment harboring diverse groups of microorganisms, including the endophytic microorganisms that are the focus of this study. because of their intimate association with plants, endophytic microorganisms could be explored for biotechnologically significant products, such as enzymes, proteins, antibiotics and others. here, we isolated endophytic microorganisms from two mangrove species, rhizophora mangle and avicennia nitida, that are found in streams in two mangrove systems in bertioga and cananeia, brazil. bacillus was the most frequently isolated genus, comprising 42% of the species isolated from cananeia and 28% of the species from bertioga. however, other common endophytic genera such as pantoea, curtobacterium and enterobacter were also found. after identifying the isolates, the bacterial communities were evaluated for enzyme production. protease activity was observed in 75% of the isolates, while endoglucanase activity occurred in 62% of the isolates. bacillus showed the highest activity rates for amylase and esterase and endoglucanase. to our knowledge, this is the first reported diversity analysis performed on endophytic  bacteria obtained from the branches of mangrove trees and the first overview of the specific enzymes produced by different bacterial genera. this work contributes to our knowledge of the microorganisms and enzymes present in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == control of diatraea saccharalis by the endophytic pantoea agglomerans 33.1 expressing cry1ac7.
AB  == despite the fact that bacillus thuringiensis (bt) is found in more than 90 % of the products used against insects, it has some difficulty reaching the internal regions where the larvae feed. to solve this problem, many genetically modified microorganisms that colonize the same pests have been developed. thus, the endophytic bacterium pantoea agglomerans (33.1), which has been recently described as a promising sugarcane growth promoter, was genetically modified with the pjtt vector (which carries the gene cry1ac7) to control the sugarcane borer,  diatraea saccharalis. firstly, the bioassays for d. saccharalis control by 33.1:pjtt were conducted with an artificial diet. a new in vivo methodology was also developed, which confirmed the partial control of larvae by 33.1:pjtt. the 33.1:pjtt strain was inoculated into sugarcane stalks containing the d. saccharalis larvae. in the sugarcane stalks, 33.1:pjtt was able to increase the mortality of d. saccharalis larvae, impair larval development and decrease larval weight. sugarcane seedlings were inoculated with 33.1:pjtt, and re-isolation confirmed the capacity of 33.1:pjtt to continuously colonize the sugarcane. these results prove that p. agglomerans (33.1), a sugarcane growth promoter, can be improved by expressing the cry protein, and the resulting strain is able to control the sugarcane borer.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == bacillus sp. sxb and pantoea sp. imh, aerobic as(v)-reducing bacteria isolated from arsenic-contaminated soil.
AB  == aims: to isolate highly effective aerobic as(v)-reducing bacteria from arsenic(as)-contaminated soils in northwest china and to identify their dynamic as(v) reduction processes and genomic detoxification mechanisms. methods and results: enrichment cultures were performed aerobically in tryptone, yeast extract and glucose medium in the presence of as(v). strain sxb isolated from soil in shanxi province, belonging to bacillus genus, reduced as(v) more effectively under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions. strain imh, a strictly aerobic isolate obtained from soil in inner mongolia, identified as pantoea, is reported for the first time to reduce as(v). both isolates could reduce over 90% as(v) in 36 h under aerobic conditions. putative gene fragments for the arsb efflux pump gene were obtained from both strains. the putative arsenate reductase gene was only amplified from strain sxb. a putative arsh gene  was amplified from strain imh. conclusions: strains sxb and imh isolated from the as-contaminated soils reduce as(v) effectively under aerobic conditions via a detoxification mechanism regulated by ars operons. significance and impact of the study: pantoea genus is reported to reduce as(v) for the first time. this study provides a full understanding of the highly effective as(v)-reducing bacteria sxb and imh, which could influence the as biogeochemical cycle in soils.

TI  == isolation and characterization of indigenous endophytic bacteria associated with  leaves of switchgrass (panicum virgatum l.) cultivars.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial endophytes from cultivars  of switchgrass and study their antimicrobial and growth promoting potential. methods and results: the diversity, molecular and biochemical characterizations of indigenous and culturable bacterial endophytes residing in leaves of switchgrass have not been studied previously. this study describes the characterization of 31 bacterial endophytes from three switchgrass cutlivars: cave-in rock, blue jacket and tecumseh. molecular and phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna sequence grouped the endophytes into eight different taxa that shared high homology of 98-99% with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as microbacterium testaceum, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, bacillus subtilis and bacillus pumilus, pseudomonas fluorescens, sphingomonas parapaucimobilis, serratia sp. and pantoea ananatis. some endophytes were detected in switchgrass seeds and in plants that originated from seeds collected  a year earlier, confirming vertical transmission to the next generation of the host. selected endophytes produced cellulases and were capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus. analysis of cell-free culture filtrate of selected strains  using direct infusion orbitrap mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of several well-characterized lipopeptide toxins and phytohormones. re-inoculation of the roots of switchgrass seedlings with endophytes singly or combined confirmed their migration to the upper aerial parts of the plant. conclusions: our findings suggest that switchgrass leaves harbour a diversity of bacterial endophytes, some of which could potentially be applied as growth promoting bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report on the characterization of indigenous bacterial endophytes and their potential use as biofertilizers.

TI  == culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community from chungkookjang, a traditional korean fermented soybean food.
AB  == the bacterial community of chungkookjang and raw rice-straw collected from various areas in south korea was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. pure cultures were isolated from chungkookjang and raw rice-straw on tryptic soy agar plates with 72 to 121 colonies and identified  by 16s rdna gene sequence analysis, respectively. the traditional culture-based method and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of pcr-amplified 16s  rdna confirmed that pantoea agglomerans and b. subtilis were identified as predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang, respectively, from iljuk district of gyeonggi province, p. ananatis and b. licheniformis were identified as predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang from wonju district of gangwon province, and microbacterium sp. and b. licheniformis were identified as  predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang from sunchang district of jeolla province. other strains, such as bacillus, enterococcus, pseudomonas, rhodococcus, and uncultured bacteria were also present in raw rice-straw and chungkookjang. practical application: a comprehensive analysis of these microorganisms would provide a more detailed understanding of the biologically active components of chungkookjang and help improve its quality. polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis can be successfully applied to a fermented food to detect unculturable or more species than the culture-dependent method. this technique is an effective and convenient culture-independent method for studying the bacterial community in chungkookjang. in this study, the bacterial community of chungkookjang collected from various areas in south korea was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.

TI  == study in vitro of the impact of endophytic bacteria isolated from centella asiatica on the disease incidence caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
AB  == thirty-one endophytic bacteria isolated from healthy leaves of centella asiatica  were screened in vitro for their ability to reduce the growth rate and disease incidence of colletotrichum higginsianum, a causal agent of anthracnose. isolates of cohnella sp., paenibacillus sp. and pantoea sp. significantly stimulated the growth rate of c. higginsianum mucl 44942, while isolates of achromobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., microbacterium sp., klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas putida had  no influence on this plant pathogen. by contrast, bacillus subtilis bca31 and pseudomonas fluorescens bca08 caused a marked inhibition of c. higginsianum mucl  44942 growth by 46 and 82 %, respectively. cell-free culture filtrates of b. subtilis bca31 and p. fluorescens bca08 were found to contain antifungal compounds against c. higginsianum mucl 44942. inoculation assays on in vitro-cultured plants of c. asiatica showed that foliar application of b. subtilis bca31, three days before inoculation with c. higginsianum mucl 44942, significantly reduced incidence and severity of the disease. the role of endophytic bacteria in maintaining the apparent inactivity of c. higginsianum mucl 44942 in c. asiatica grown in the wild is discussed.

TI  == application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to microbial diversity analysis in chinese douchi.
AB  == background: douchi is a traditional chinese soybean food which has been consumed  for thousands years as an important protein source and flavouring ingredient. studies have rarely been carried out to investigate its microbial composition and these are urgently required for the commercial labels and safety considerations.  results: microbial counts were statistically significant different among douchi samples. although the maximum diversity indexes of bacterial, bacillus and fungal polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) patterns were only 79%, 70% and 64%, some microorganisms, e.g. bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, pseudomonas sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia  farinose, were found to share dominant positions in most douchi samples. in addition, some pathogens, e.g. staphylococcus saprophyticus, pantoea sp., staphylococcus sciuri, enterobacter sp. and staphylococcus sp., were also identified. conclusion: the pcr-dgge technique was used for the first time as an  effective method to assess the microbial communities in different chinese douchi  samples. this information may be useful in improving the product quality, reformatting production methods, extending shelf life and scaling up the fermentation process.

TI  == identification of the midgut microbiota of an. stephensi and an. maculipennis for their application as a paratransgenic tool against malaria.
AB  == the midgut microbiota associated with anopheles stephensi and anopheles maculipennis (diptera: culicidae) was investigated for development of a paratransgenesis-based approach to control malaria transmission in eastern mediterranean region (emr). here, we present the results of a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and biochemical-based approaches to identify the female adult and  larvae mosquitoe microbiota of these two major malaria vectors, originated from south eastern and north of iran. plating the mosquito midgut contents from lab-reared and field-collected anopheles spp. was used for microbiota isolation.  the gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial colonies were identified by gram staining and specific mediums. selected colonies were identified by differential  biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a number of 10 an. stephensi and 32 an. maculipennis adult mosquitoes and 15 an. stephensi and 7 an. maculipennis larvae were analyzed and 13 sequences of 16s rrna gene bacterial species were retrieved, that were categorized in 3 classes and 8 families. the majority of the identified bacteria were belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria class, including pseudomonas sp. and aeromonas sp. and the others were some closely related to those found in other vector mosquitoes, including pantoea, acinetobacter, brevundimonas, bacillus, sphingomonas, lysinibacillus and rahnella. the 16s rrna sequences in the current study aligned with the reference  strains available in genbank were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree  that revealed the relatedness among the bacteria identified. the presented data strongly encourage further investigations, to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria for the malaria control in iran and neighboring countries.

TI  == a multiphasic approach for the identification of endophytic bacterial in strawberry fruit and their potential for plant growth promotion.
AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial species diversity of spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out at selected farms in ivory coast and brazil.
AB  == to compare the spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process carried out in different cocoa-producing regions, heap and box (one ivorian farm) and box (two brazilian farms) fermentations were carried out. all fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. in general, the temperature inside the fermenting mass increased throughout all fermentations and reached end-values of 42-48 degrees c. the main end-products of pulp carbohydrate catabolism were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. in the case of the fermentations on the selected ivorian farm, the species diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) was restricted. lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were the predominant lab species, due to their ethanol and acid tolerance and citrate consumption. the levels of mannitol, ascribed to growth of l. fermentum, were fermentation-dependent. also, enterobacterial species, such as erwinia soli and pantoea sp., were among the predominating microbiota during the early stages of both heap and box fermentations in ivory coast, which could be responsible for gluconic acid production. consumption of gluconic acid at the initial phases of the ivorian fermentations could be due to yeast growth. a wider microbial species diversity throughout the fermentation process was seen in the case of the box fermentations on the selected brazilian farms, which differed, amongst other factors, regarding pod/bean selection on these farms as compared to fermentations on the selected ivorian farm. this microbiota included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus durianis, l. fermentum, lactobacillus mali, lactobacillus nagelii, l. pseudomesenteroides, and pediococcus acidilactici, as well as bacillus subtilis that was present at late fermentation, when the temperature inside the fermenting mass reached values higher than 50 degrees c. moreover, aab seemed to dominate the brazilian box fermentations studied, explaining higher acetic acid concentrations in the pulp and the beans. to conclude, it turned out that the species diversity and community dynamics, influenced by local operational practices, in particular pod/bean selection, impact the quality of fermented cocoa beans.

AB  == twenty bacteria isolated from three commercial oat bran products were tested for  their folate production capability. the bacteria as well as some reference organisms were grown until early stationary phase on a rich medium (ypd), and the amount of total folate in the separated cell mass and the culture medium (supernatant) was determined by microbiological assay. folate vitamer distribution was determined for eight bacteria including one isolated from rye flakes. for seven bacteria the effect of temperature and ph on folate production  was studied in more detail. relatively large amount of folate was both produced in the cell biomass (up to 20.8microg/g) and released to the culture medium (up to 0.38microg/g) by studied bacteria. the best producers were characterized as bacillus subtilis on4, chryseobacterium sp. nr7, janthinobacterium sp. rb4, pantoea agglomerans on2, and pseudomonas sp on8. the level of folate released in  culture medium was the highest for b. subtilis on5, chryseobacterium sp. nr7, curtobacterium sp. on7, enterococcus durans on9, janthinobacterium sp. rb4, paenibacillus sp. on10, propionibacterium sp. rb9, and staphylococcus kloosii rb7. marked differences in the distribution of folate vitamers among the bacterial strains were revealed by the hplc analysis. the main vitamers were tetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. increase in the folate content during bacterial growth  was accompanied by proportional increase in the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate content  and decrease of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. 10-formylfolic acid dominated in the culture media of four bacteria, and janthinobacterium sp. rb4 was also found to excrete 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. intracellular folate content was higher when the bacteria were grown at 28 degrees c than at 18 degrees c or 37 degrees c and  also higher at ph 7 than at ph 5.5.

TI  == culture-dependent and culture-independent characterization of microorganisms associated with aedes aegypti (diptera: culicidae) (l.) and dynamics of bacterial colonization in the midgut.
AB  == in this work we show that the lumen of aedes aegypti midgut is highly colonized by bacteria that were identified by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. rdna sequences obtained were compared with those from genbank and the main bacterial genera identified were: serratia, klebsiella, asaia, bacillus, enterococcus, enterobacter,kluyvera and pantoea. all genera were identified in midgut except enterobacter that was observed only in eggs. asaia and pantoea were also identified in eggs and ovary, respectively. in addition two yeast genera were observed in a. aegypti: pichia isolated from midgut and candida identified in midgut and ovary. the genus serratia was dominant in all isolation assays representing 54.5% of the total of microorganisms. thirty-nine and 24 bacterial clones were successfully obtained from midguts 24 and 48h after blood feeding (abf), respectively. the majority of clones obtained were from serratia sp. (48.7% and 50% for 24 and 48h abf, respectively). light microscopy showed that bacteria were located preferentially in the posterior midgut, around the blood meal and associated with peritrophic matrix. scanning electron microscopy images  showed a high number of bacteria in midgut during blood digestion and the peak of bacterial enumeration was reached 48h abf, stage in which lumen was almost totally occupied by bacteria that were also interacting with epithelial microvilli. our results show the dynamics of microbial colonization and their distribution in midgut during blood digestion.

TI  == genetic diversity of siderophore-producing bacteria of tobacco rhizosphere.
AB  == the genetic diversity of siderophore-producing bacteria of tobacco rhizosphere was studied by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rrna sequence homology and phylogenetics analysis methods. studies demonstrated that 85% of the total 354 isolates produced siderophores in iron limited liquid medium. a total of 28 ardra patterns were identified among the 299 siderophore-producing bacterial isolates. the 28 ardra patterns represented bacteria of 14 different genera belonging to six bacterial divisions, namely beta-, gamma-, alpha-proteobacteria, sphingobacteria, bacilli, and actinobacteria. especially, gamma-proteobacteria consisting of pseudomonas, enterobacter, serratia, pantoea, erwinia and stenotrophomonas genus encountered 18 different ardra groups. results also showed a greater siderophore-producing bacterial diversity than previous researches. for example, sphingobacterium (isolates g-2-21-1 and g-2-27-2), pseudomonas poae (isolate g-2-1-1), enterobacter endosymbiont (isolates g-2-10-2 and n-5-10), delftia acidovorans (isolate g-1-15), and achromobacter xylosoxidans (isolates n-46-11hh and n-5-20)  were reported to be able to produce siderophores under low-iron conditions for the first time. gram-negative isolates were more frequently encountered, with more than 95% total frequency. for gram-positive bacteria, the bacillus and rhodococcus were the only two genera, with 1.7% total frequency. furthermore, the pseudomonas and enterobacter were dominant in this environment, with 44.5% and 24.7% total frequency, respectively. it was also found that 75 percent of the isolates that had the high percentages of siderophore units (% between 40 and 60) belonged to pseudomonas. pseudomonas sp. g-229-21 screened out in this study may  have potential to apply to low-iron soil to prevent plant soil-borne fungal pathogen diseases.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacteria from eucalyptus species seeds and colonization of seedlings by pantoea agglomerans.
AB  == the diversity and beneficial characteristics of endophytic microorganisms have been studied in several host plants. however, information regarding naturally occurring seed-associated endophytes and vertical transmission among different life-history stages of hosts is limited. endophytic bacteria were isolated from seeds and seedlings of 10 eucalyptus species and two hybrids. the results showed  that endophytic bacteria, such as bacillus, enterococcus, paenibacillus and methylobacterium, are vertically transferred from seeds to seedlings. in addition, the endophytic bacterium pantoea agglomerans was tagged with the gfp gene, inoculated into seeds and further reisolated from seedlings. these results  suggested a novel approach to change the profile of the plants, where the bacterium is a delivery vehicle for desired traits. this is the first report of an endophytic bacterial community residing in eucalyptus seeds and the transmission of these bacteria from seeds to seedlings. the bacterial species reported in this work have been described as providing benefits to host plants. therefore, we suggest that endophytic bacteria can be transmitted vertically from seeds to seedlings, assuring the support of the bacterial community in the host plant.

TI  == response of endophytic bacterial communities in banana tissue culture plantlets to fusarium wilt pathogen infection.
AB  == endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without having pathogenic effects,  and various endophytes have been found to functionally benefit plant disease suppressive ability. in this study, the influence of banana plant stress on the endophytic bacterial communities, which was achieved by infection with the wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, was examined by cultivation-independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16s ribosomal dna directly amplified from plant tissue dna. community analysis clearly demonstrated increased bacterial diversity in pathogen-infected plantlets compared to that in control plantlets. by sequencing, bands most similar to species of bacillus and pseudomonas showed high density in the pathogen-treated pattern. in vitro screening of the isolates for antagonistic activity against fusarium wilt pathogen acquired three strains of endophytic bacteria which were found to match those species that obviously increased in the pathogen infection process; moreover, the most inhibitive strain could also interiorly colonize plantlets and perform antagonism. the evidence obtained from this work showed that antagonistic endophytic bacteria could be induced by the appearance of a host fungal pathogen and further be an ideal biological control agent to use in banana fusarium wilt disease protection.

TI  == isolation of bacterial endophytes from germinated maize kernels.
AB  == the germination of surface-sterilized maize kernels under aseptic conditions proved to be a suitable method for isolation of kernel-associated bacterial endophytes. bacterial strains identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing as pantoea sp., microbacterium sp., frigoribacterium sp., bacillus sp., paenibacillus sp., and sphingomonas sp. were isolated from kernels of 4 different maize cultivars. genus pantoea was associated with a specific maize cultivar. the kernels of this cultivar were often overgrown with the fungus lecanicillium aphanocladii; however, those exhibiting pantoea growth were never colonized with  it. furthermore, the isolated bacterium strain inhibited fungal growth in vitro.

TI  == biosurfactant production by antarctic facultative anaerobe pantoea sp. during growth on hydrocarbons.
AB  == the facultative anaerobe pantoea sp. strain a-13, isolated from ornithogenic soil of dewart island (frazier islands), antarctica, produced glycolipid biosurfactants when grown on n-paraffins or kerosene as the sole source of carbon and energy. hemolysis of erythrocytes, growth inhibition of bacillus subtilis, and thin-layer chromatography studies have suggested that the secreted glycolipids are rhamnolipids. glycolipids produced by kerosene-grown cells decreased the surface tension at the air-water interface to 30 mn/m and possessed a low critical micelle concentration value of 40 mg/l, which indicated high surface activity. they efficiently emulsified aromatic hydrocarbons, kerosene, and n-paraffins. biosurfactant production contributed to an increase in cell hydrophobicity, which correlated with increased growth of the strain on tested hydrocarbons. according to the results, the antarctic biosurfactant-producing strain pantoea sp. a-13 appears to be valuable source for application in accelerated environmental bioremediation.

TI  == characterization of microbial contamination in united states air force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  == bacteria and fungi, isolated from united states air force (usaf) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (gc-fame) profiling and 16s or 18s rrna gene sequencing. thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated usaf bases were collected. at each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. twelve genera, including four bacillus species and two staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. of the organisms identified, bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, sphinogmonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and the fungus aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. the bacteria pantoea ananatis, arthrobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., kocuria rhizophilia, leucobacter komagatae, dietza sp., and the fungus discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in usaf aviation fuel. only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and  identification techniques.

TI  == rapid, specific and quantitative assays for the detection of the endophytic bacterium methylobacterium mesophilicum in plants.
AB  == xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterium that causes citrus variegated chlorosis disease in sweet orange. there is evidence that x. fastidiosa interacts with endophytic bacteria present in the xylem of sweet orange, and that these interactions, particularly with methylobacterium mesophilicum, may affect disease progress. however, these interactions cannot be evaluated in detail until efficient methods for detection and enumeration of these bacteria in planta are developed. we have previously developed standard and quantitative pcr-based assays specific for x. fastidiosa using the lightcycler system [li, w.b., pria jr., l.p.m.w.d., x. qin, and j.s. hartung, 2003. presence of xylella fastidiosa in sweet orange fruit and seeds and its transmission to seedlings. phytopathology 93:953-958.], and now report the development of both standard and quantitative pcr assays for m. mesophilicum. the assays are specific for m. mesophilicum and do not amplify dna from other species of methylobacterium or other bacteria commonly associated with citrus or plant tissue. other bacteria tested included curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, pantoea agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus sp., x. fastidiosa, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. we have demonstrated that with these methods we can quantitatively monitor the colonization of xylem by m. mesophilicum during the course of disease development in plants artificially inoculated with both bacteria.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.
