TI  == role of emerging campylobacter species in inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == the gut microbiota is a central player in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. as such, there is intense scientific interest in elucidating the specific group/s of bacteria responsible for driving barrier damage and perpetuating the chronic inflammation that results in disease. because of their ability to colonize close to the surface of the host intestinal epithelium, mucosa-associated bacteria are considered key players in the initiation and development of both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. the leading bacterial candidates include adherent and invasive escherichia coli, helicobacter, fusobacteria, mycobacteria, and campylobacter species. of these, a member of the  campylobacter genus, campylobacter concisus, has recently emerged as a putative player in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. current research indicates that this bacterium possesses extraordinarily diverse pathogenic capacities as well as unique genetic and functional signatures that are defined by their ability to adhere to and invade host cells, secrete toxins, and the presence of a virulence-associated restriction-modification system. these characteristics enable the potential classification of c. concisus into distinct  pathotypes, which we have named adherent and invasive c. concisus and adherent and toxinogenic c. concisus. in this review, we evaluate evidence for the role of emerging campylobacter species in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == ibd-what role do proteobacteria play?
AB  == the gastrointestinal microbiota has come to the fore in the search for the causes of ibd. this shift has largely been driven by the finding of genetic polymorphisms involved in gastrointestinal innate immunity (particularly polymorphisms in nod2 and genes involved in autophagy) and alterations in the composition of the microbiota that might result in inflammation (so-called dysbiosis). microbial diversity studies have continually demonstrated an expansion of the proteobacteria phylum in patients with ibd. individual proteobacteria, in particular (adherent-invasive) escherichia coli, campylobacter concisus and enterohepatic helicobacter, have all been associated with the pathogenesis of ibd. in this review, we comprehensively describe the various associations of proteobacteria and ibd. we also examine the importance of pattern recognition in the extracellular innate immune response of the host with particular reference to proteobacteria, and postulate that proteobacteria with adherent and invasive properties might exploit host defenses, drive proinflammatory change, alter the intestinal microbiota in favor of dysbiosis and ultimately lead to the development of ibd.

TI  == characterization of campylobacter concisus hemolysins.
AB  == campylobacter concisus is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in the human oral cavity. it has also been isolated from clinical sources including gastroenteritis cases. both secreted and cell-associated hemolytic activities were detected in c. concisus strains isolated from children with gastroenteritis. the secreted hemolytic activity of c. concisus strains was labile and was detected in variable levels from fresh-culture filtrates only. in addition, another secreted hemolysin/cytotoxin with a molecular weight < 10 kda was detected in a single c. concisus strain (rch 12). a c. concisus genomic library,  constructed from strain rch 3 in escherichia coli xl1-blue, was screened for hemolytic clones. subcloning and sequence analysis of selected hemolytic clones identified orfs for genes that enhance hemolytic activity but do not appear to be related to any known hemolysin genes found in gram-negative bacteria. in a previous study, a stable cell-associated hemolysin was identified as an outer-membrane phospholipase a (ompla) encoded by the plda gene. in this study, we report cloning of the plda gene of the clinical strain c. concisus rch 3 and the complementation of phospholipase a activity in an e. coli plda mutant.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that  of non-smokers. the study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. the samples were cultured aerobically  and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the differences in bacterial counts using  the mann whitney u test were statistically significant for staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens, escherichia coli, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gracilis, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis,  selenomonas sputigena and candida albicans in smokers. statistically significant  differences for peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, eubacterium lentum and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. the isolation  of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like e. coli, c. albicans and s. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
