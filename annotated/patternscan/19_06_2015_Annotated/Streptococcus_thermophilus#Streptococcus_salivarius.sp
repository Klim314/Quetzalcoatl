TI  == the probiotic vsl#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for crohn's disease.
AB  == background & aims: probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of crohn's disease after surgery. we  investigated the ability of vsl#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of vsl#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of lactobacillus, 3 strains of bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence  at day 90 received vsl#3 until day 365. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. results: at day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between vsl#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, p = .19). the proportions  of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 from days 90 through 365) (p = .09). aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early vsl#3 group and  42.1% in the late vsl#3 group. patients receiving vsl#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (p < .05). crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. conclusions: there were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received vsl#3 and patients who received placebo. lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early vsl#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for  prevention of crohn's disease recurrence. clinical trials.gov number: nct00175292.

TI  == genomics of streptococcus salivarius, a major human commensal.
AB  == the salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. this group consists of three genetically similar species, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus thermophilus. s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas s. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in  dairy production. we developed multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and comparative  genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. these analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of s. salivarius sensu stricto. s. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. by  contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. the species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7mb for s. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3mb for s. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for s. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of s. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. however, although the s. salivarius strains  studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.

TI  == treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of lactobacillus  salivarius ls01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  == goals: to evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by streptococcus thermophilus st10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (ad). background: previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in ad symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain l. salivarius ls01. s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. study: a prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of s. thermophilus st10 and tara gum  could improve the activity of l. salivarius ls01 administered at high doses to adults with ad. twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. scoring atopic dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. results: a significant improvement in scorad index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. a slight decrease in fecal s. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. conclusions: data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for l. salivarius ls01 in the treatment of ad. the addition of tara gum and s. thermophilus st10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.

TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == the yogurt amino acid profile's variation during the shelf-life.
AB  == objective: to analyze the yogurt amino acid profile starting from marketing through the whole shelf-life. the evaluation of the proteolytic activity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, allows to deduce their vitality during the shelf-life period and within 45 days. methods: three types of full fats yogurts have been analyzed (a)  natural white (b) sweet white and (c) whole fruit - in two stages: t0 (first day  of shelf-life) and t1 (end of shelf-life). the proteins have been analyzed by the kjeldahl method and the amino acid profile by hplc. results: in natural yogurt a  significant increase of the amount of free amino acids has been observed during the period of shelf-life (97%). in the sweetened full fats and fruit yogurt, instead, there is a lower increase of respectively 33% and 39% conclusions: in whole milk natural yogurt, based on our data, the proteolytic activity seems to persist during the entire period of the shelf-life and this can be considered an  index of bacterial survival, especially of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the marketing process.

TI  == control of natural transformation in salivarius streptococci through specific degradation of sigmax by the meca-clpcp protease complex.
AB  == competence for natural dna transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. in mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(x) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the comrs signaling system via the sigma(x)/comx/sigx-inducing peptide (xip), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein meca and its associated clp atpase, clpc. in this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the meca-clpc control system in the salivarius species streptococcus thermophilus. using in vitro approaches,  we showed that meca specifically interacts with both sigma(x) and clpc, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(x)-meca-clpc complex. moreover, we demonstrated that meca ultimately targets sigma(x) for its degradation by the clpcp protease in an atp-dependent manner. we also identify a short sequence (18  amino acids) in the n-terminal domain of sigma(x) as essential for the interaction with meca and subsequent sigma(x) degradation. finally, increased transformability of a meca-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing xip concentrations suggests that the meca-clpcp proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. a model of the interplay between comrs and meca-clpcp in the control of sigma(x) activity is proposed.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == viability of probiotic lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. to exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) cfu/g or ml throughout its shelf life. one of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. the objective of this study was to  investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. yoghurts with l. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),  added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. yoghurt without  probiotic added was produced as a control. the products were stored at 4 degrees  c and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. in these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters ph and acidity were analyzed. the results were evaluated using analysis of variance and tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. l. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) cfu / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. when the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of l. casei except for the first day of storage.

TI  == diversity of human small intestinal streptococcus and veillonella populations.
AB  == molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of streptococcus and veillonella populations in the small intestine. microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of streptococcus spp. most affiliated with s. salivarius, s. thermophilus, and s. parasanguinis, as well as veillonella spp. affiliated with v. atypica, v. parvula, v. dispar, and v. rogosae. relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. streptococcus and veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. the richness of the streptococcus and veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16s rrna gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. a total of 160 streptococcus and 37 veillonella isolates were obtained. genetic fingerprinting differentiated  seven streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. the veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. our study demonstrated that the small intestinal streptococcus  populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  == biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. in this study, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for  a large collection of lab of different origins. the tested isolates belong to 11  species of the lactobacillus genus and to streptococcus thermophilus, streptococcus salivarius and lactococcus garvieae. the results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (bc), triclosan (tr), chlorhexidine (ch), and sodium hypochlorite (sh) are not frequent among lab. moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high mic values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher mic values for the other biocides.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: several studies have suggested that probiotics (prob) and/or prebiotics (preb) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. we aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with prob and preb could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (aom). methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from november 2007 to april 2009, 37 pediatricians in france enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of aom who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with prob (streptococcus thermophilus ncc 2496, streptococcus salivarius dsm 13084, lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr cgmcc 1.3724) and preb (raftilose/raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). during 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of aom episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by  the poisson model (incidence rate ratio [irr]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% ci]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. results: we enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). all children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. in total, 486 aom episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. the treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of aom (irr 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (irr 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (irr = 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2). treatment was not associated with recurrent aom (odds ratio 1.0, 95% ci: 0.5-1.7). with regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. conclusion: the prob and preb included in follow-up formula given to children at  7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of aom, recurrent aom, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against listeria monocytogenes infection. in this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven  l. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain l. salivarius ucc118. this revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these  strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class iib bacteriocins. however, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. they ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin p, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin t, which is characterized in this study. salivaricin t inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little  homology to previously characterized salivaricins. interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin t activity, saltalpha and saltbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus. furthermore, the salivaricin  locus of strain dpc6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class iid  anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin l. these findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal l. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.

TI  == some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus la-k.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 mpa or less. it is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0,  3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 mpa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12, s. salivarius ssp.  thermophilus st-m5, and l. acidophilus la-k. the cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees c) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of  incubation. protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. all homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. a pressure of 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of l. acidophilus la-k but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. some low homogenization pressures  positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and l. acidophilus la-k. culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == emergence of a cell wall protease in the streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. a multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that s. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. an analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prts gene was carried out within  this evolutionary scheme. this gene encodes a protease that allows better growth  in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. the s. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal streptococcus suis protein prts. genomic analysis showed that prts is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the s. suis genome. these data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to s. suis. the analysis of the distribution of the prts gene in s. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by  lateral transfer in the s. thermophilus population. taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of s. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. the source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

TI  == galactose metabolism and capsule formation in a recombinant strain of streptococcus thermophilus with a galactose-fermenting phenotype.
AB  == the capsule-producing, galactose-negative streptococcus thermophilus mr-1c strain was first transformed with a low-copy plasmid containing a functional galk gene from streptococcus salivarius to generate a recombinant galactose-fermenting strep. thermophilus strain named mr-aac. then, we compared the functional properties of strep. thermophilus mr-aac with those of the parent mr-1c strain when used as starter for fermented products and cheese. in lactose-supplemented laboratory medium, mr-aac metabolized galactose, but only when the amount of lactose was less than 0.1% (wt/vol). after 7 h of fermentation, the medium was almost depleted of galactose. the parent strain, mr-1c, showed the same pattern,  except that the concentration of galactose decreased by only 25% during the same  period. it was found that, during milk fermentation and mozzarella cheese production, the galactose-fermenting phenotype was not expressed by mr-aac and this strain expelled galactose into the medium at a level similar to the parent mr-1c strain. in milk and in lactose-supplemented medium, capsular exopolysaccharide production occurred mainly during the late exponential phase and the stationary growth phase with similar kinetics between mr-1c and mr-aac.

TI  == urease biogenesis in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == urease biogenesis was monitored in the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus during the growth cycle using in-gel detection and a phenol-hypochloride assay. zymogram analysis, performed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, enabled visualization of a complex profile of bands whose number and intensity were dependent on the growth phase and culture conditions. the monitoring of urease biogenesis in batch fermentations revealed the onset of  enzyme synthesis starting from the mid-exponential growth phase, with a maximum reached during the late exponential phase. urease activity strongly increased at  acidic ph but to a lesser extent when urea and nickel ions were added to the culture medium. when s. thermophilus cells were cultured with ph maintained at a  neutral value, urease activity was detectable only in gel with extremely low signals. evaluation of beta-glucuronidase activity in strain dsm 20617(t) harboring a transcriptional fusion between a dna fragment containing the putative urease promoter and the gusa reporter evidenced significant expression at neutral ph that strongly increased in an acidic environment. further experiments carried  out on p(urei)-gusa recombinant strain revealed that expression of ure genes was  not affected by carbohydrates, nickel or urea availability. the presence of consistent expression of ure genes at neutral ph and the absence of induction of  expression by carbohydrate availability demonstrated that the transcription of ure genes in s. thermophilus is regulated differently compared with that of the closely related s. salivarius. these differences are discussed taking into consideration the different habitats colonized by the two bacterial species.

TI  == the doubly phosphorylated form of hpr, hpr(ser~p)(his-p), is abundant in exponentially growing cells of streptococcus thermophilus and phosphorylates the  lactose transporter lacs as efficiently as hpr(his~p).
AB  == in streptococcus thermophilus, lactose is taken up by lacs, a transporter that comprises a membrane translocator domain and a hydrophilic regulatory domain homologous to the iia proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). the iia domain of lacs (iialacs) possesses a histidine residue that can be phosphorylated by hpr(his~p), a protein component of the pts. however, determination of the cellular levels of  the different forms of hpr, namely, hpr, hpr(his~p), hpr(ser-p), and hpr(ser-p)(his~p), in exponentially lactose-growing cells revealed that the doubly phosphorylated form of hpr represented 75% and 25% of the total hpr in s.  thermophilus atcc 19258 and s. thermophilus smq-301, respectively. experiments conducted with [32p]pep and purified recombinant s. thermophilus atcc 19258 proteins (ei, hpr, and iialacs) showed that iialacs was reversibly phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) at a rate similar to that measured with hpr(his~p). sequence analysis of the iialacs protein domains from several s. thermophilus strains indicated that they can be divided into two groups on the basis of their amino acid sequences. the amino acid sequence of iialacs from group i, to which strain  19258 belongs, differed from that of group ii at 11 to 12 positions. to ascertain whether iialacs from group ii could also be phosphorylated by hpr(his~p) and hpr(ser-p)(his~p), in vitro phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, which possesses a iialacs very similar to group ii s. thermophilus iialacs. the results indicated that s. salivarius iialacs was phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) at a higher rate than that observed with hpr(his~p). our results suggest that the reversible  phosphorylation of iialacs in s. thermophilus is accomplished by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) as well as by hpr(his~p).

TI  == characterization of a galactokinase-positive recombinant strain of streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely used by the dairy  industry for its ability to transform lactose, the primary sugar found in milk, into lactic acid. unlike the phylogenetically related species streptococcus salivarius, s. thermophilus is unable to metabolize and grow on galactose and thus releases substantial amounts of this hexose into the external medium during  growth on lactose. this metabolic property may result from the inability of s. thermophilus to synthesize galactokinase, an enzyme of the leloir pathway that phosphorylates intracellular galactose to generate galactose-1-phosphate. in this work, we report the complementation of gal(-) strain s. thermophilus smq-301 with s. salivarius galk, the gene that codes for galactokinase, and the characterization of recombinant strain smq-301k01. the recombinant strain, which  was obtained by transformation of strain smq-301 with ptrkl2tk, a plasmid bearing s. salivarius galk, grew on galactose with a generation time of 55 min, which was almost double the generation time on lactose. data confirmed that (i) the ability of smq-301k01 to grow on galactose resulted from the expression of s. salivarius  galk and (ii) transcription of the plasmid-borne galk gene did not require galr,  a transcriptional regulator of the gal and lac operons, and did not interfere with the transcription of these operons. unexpectedly, recombinant strain smq-301k01 still expelled galactose during growth on lactose, but only when the amount of the disaccharide in the medium exceeded 0.05%. thus, unlike s. salivarius, the ability to metabolize galactose was not sufficient for s. thermophilus to simultaneously metabolize the glucose and galactose moieties of lactose. nevertheless, during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions that simulated those used to produce mozzarella cheese, the recombinant gal(+) strain grew and produced acid more rapidly than the gal(-) wild-type strain.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == characterization of urease genes cluster of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: the milk acidification rate of streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. to evaluate the technological suitability of s. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to  urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain dsm 20167t. methods and results: amplification of the urease genes of s. thermophilus dsm 20167t was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related s. salivarius. nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureabc (structural genes) and urei, ureefgd (accessory genes) of s. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. reverse transcriptase pcr experiments were in agreement with  an operon organization for the eight genes (ureiabcefgd). a food grade mutant a16 (deltaurec3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in urec gene exhibited a urease negative (ure-) phenotype. unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. a small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using  the wild-type or the ure- mutant a16 (deltaurec3) in co-culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 in presence of urea. the result obtained underlines that when the ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. conclusions: the study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of s. thermophilus dsm 20617t urease activity. significance and impact of the study: the detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade ure- recombinant strain. small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a ure-s. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in  milk fermentations. moreover, the vector pmi108 developed for the construction of the ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of ure- dairy s. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.

TI  == identification and characterization of the nickel uptake system for urease biogenesis in streptococcus salivarius 57.i.
AB  == ureases are multisubunit enzymes requiring ni(2+) for activity. the low ph-inducible urease gene cluster in streptococcus salivarius 57.i is organized as an operon, beginning with urei, followed by ureabc (structural genes), and ureefgd (accessory genes). urease biogenesis also requires a high-affinity ni(2+) uptake system. by searching the partial genome sequence of a closely related organism, streptococcus thermophilus lmg18311, three open reading frame (orfs) homologous to those encoding proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and cobalt transport (cbimqo) were identified immediately 3' to the ure operon. to determine whether these genes were involved in urease biogenesis by catalyzing ni(2+) uptake in s. salivarius, regions 3' to ured were amplified by pcrs from s. salivarius by using primers identical to the s. thermophilus sequences. sequence  analysis of the products revealed three orfs. reverse transcriptase pcr was used  to demonstrate that the orfs are transcribed as part of the ure operon. insertional inactivation of orf1 with a polar kanamycin marker completely abolished urease activity and the ability to accumulate (63)ni(2+) during growth. supplementation of the growth medium with nicl(2) at concentrations as low as 2.5 micro m partially restored urease activity in the mutant. both wild-type and mutant strains showed enhanced urease activity when exogenous ni(2+) was provided at neutral ph. enhancement of urease activity by adding nickel was regulated at the posttranslational level. thus, orf1, orf2, and orf3 are part of the ure operon, and these genes, designated urem, ureq, and ureo, respectively, likely encode a ni(2+)-specific atp-binding cassette transporter.

TI  == phosphorylation of streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (lacs) by hpr(his ~  p) and hpr(ser-p)(his ~ p) and effects on growth.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called lacs that shares 95% identity with the lacs from streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. s. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. expulsion of galactose is mediated via lacs and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by hpr(his approximately p), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). unlike s. thermophilus, s. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took  up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. analysis of the c-terminal end of s. salivarius lacs revealed a iia-like domain (iia(lacs)) almost identical to the iia domain of s. thermophilus lacs. experiments performed with purified proteins showed that s. salivarius iia(lacs) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by hpr(his approximately p) but also by hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p), a doubly phosphorylated form of hpr present in large amounts in rapidly growing s. salivarius cells. two other major s. salivarius pts proteins, iiab(l)(man) and iiab(h)(man), were unable to phosphorylate iia(lacs). the effect of lacs phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain g71, an s. salivarius enzyme i-negative mutant that cannot synthesize hpr(his approximately p) or hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p). these results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.

TI  == the effect of temperature and ph on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a ph-auxostat study.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region sequence variation in streptococcus thermophilus and related dairy streptococci and development of a multiplex its-sscp analysis for their identification.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna internal transcribed spacer (its) region of several streptococcus thermophilus strains and some related dairy streptococci, s. macedonicus, s. salivarius and s. bovis, was analysed by sequence analysis. all the streptococcus species were easily discriminated on the basis of sequence variations principally located upstream and downstream of the region encompassing the double-stranded processing sites and the trna(ala) gene. comparison between trna(ala) gene sequences highlighted a high level of sequence conservation among  the streptococcus species investigated despite their belonging to separated phylogenetic clusters, i.e. the s. salivarius and s. bovis rrna groups. a low but significant degree of variability was detected among the s. thermophilus strains, allowing the identification of four different its sequences. similarity analysis  of the its sequences showed that the streptococcus species were clustered in two  main branches, one containing s. macedonicus and s. bovis strains, and one containing s. thermophilus and s. salivarius strains. with the aim of developing  a rapid tool for the identification of the dairy streptococci species a multiplex its-sscp analysis of two discrete regions within the its locus was carried out.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in traditional african yoghurt fermentation.
AB  == growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/-  0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c  for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but  not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

TI  == simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  == indisim, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. to this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. in the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. it was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. an important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. in the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. the results of these  simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of  [lait 69 (1989) 519]. finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.

TI  == galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that  metabolizes lactose but not galactose. in this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the s. salivarius and s. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters.  the clusters have the same organization with the order galr (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galk (galactokinase), galt (galactose-1-p uridylyltransferase), gale (udp-glucose 4-epimerase), galm (galactose mutarotase), lacs (lactose transporter), and lacz (beta-galactosidase). an analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as northern  blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galr, the gal operon, galm, and the lac operon of s. salivarius. putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the s. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. an additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galt was found in s. thermophilus but not in s. salivarius. the results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. the shine-dalgarno sequences of galt and gale were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of s. thermophilus galk differed from that of s. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the s. thermophilus galk gene might be poorly translated. this was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.

AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

AB  == background: although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. aim: to evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. patients and methods: twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-asa, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (vsl#3, csl, milan, italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. the following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. results: faecal concentrations of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (p<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. concentrations of bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (p = n.s.). fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. no significant side-effects have been reported. conclusions: these results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may  be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant  or allergic to 5-asa. controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.

TI  == starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  == the refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of lactobacillus fermentum, l. casei, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus,  and bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. after 28 days, the average numbers of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml, whereas those of l. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) cfu/ml. numbers of b. longum and l. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and l. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. the other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (p > 0.05) on the residual sugars. in most cases, l(+)-lactate predominated.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent dna damage in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. because the mechanisms responsible for these protective  effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. using the "comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that l. bulgaricus 191r applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced dna breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas st. thermophilus ch3 were not effective. however, in vitro, both strains  prevented dna damage induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in isolated primary rat colon cells. extracts prepared from milk fermented with st.  thermophilus ch3 were as efficient in deactivating mnng as was l-cysteine. isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [l(+) lactate, d(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. we postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which mnng or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.

TI  == random amplified polymorphic dna and amplified ribosomal dna spacer polymorphism: powerful methods to differentiate streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  == streptococci from different collections and dairy materials were characterized by conventional and molecular methods. after amplification of the 16s-23s rdna spacer region, all the strains referable to the genus streptococcus exhibited a single polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product, allowing their differentiation from enterococci. cleaving this pcr product with hae iii, two different restriction patterns could be observed, allowing streptococcus salivarius dsm 20560t, strep. thermophilus ncdo 822 and two strains of streptococcus spp. to be  gathered in one group and all the other strains in another. in order to achieve strain typing, all the cultures were investigated by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis employing two selected primers. the results were treated  by cluster analysis, appearing significantly consistent with both the taxonomic position and the origin of the strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of sma i digests of the genomic dna from 11 representative strains with decreasing levels of rapd similarity allowed their diversity to be confirmed, even though rapd-pcr proved to be less discriminating than pfge analysis. the results are discussed with reference to the capability of the analytical procedures used to aid both identification and strain typing of streptococci, as  well as the taxonomic structure of the species strep. thermophilus.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == selection of an adhesive phenotype of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus for use in fixed-bed reactors.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was cultivated in a chemostat in order to obtain an adhesive phenotype of this strain. when the system was operated at low dilution rates (d < 0.2 h-1) for about 4 weeks, the strain formed a visible film on the surface of the culture vessel. the biofilm cells were not washed out even when dilution rates were increased (d = 6.9 h-1), and this resulted in a high biomass productivity (p = 4.1 g1(-1) h-1). on the other hand,  when the culture was grown at dilution rates faster than 0.2 h-1, only the free suspended cells were present in the culture broth, and were washed out at velocities of about 1.0 h-1. the biomass productivity was consequently lower (p = 1.33 g1(-1) h-1) than in the previous case. the selected adhesive phenotype was grown on different glass beads and the possibility of lactate fermentation in a continuous and semicontinuous mode was demonstrated.

(1995) 334, 213-224). we are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against mnng.

TI  == direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  == a system for direct screening of recombinant clones in lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (snase) in the organism, was developed. the nuc gene (encoding snase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. l. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete snase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. a multicloning site (mcs) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature snase, without affecting nuclease activity. cloning foreign dna fragments into any site of the mcs interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant  clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. the utility of  this system for l. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and escherichia coli chromosomal dna fragments into the mcs of the nucmcs  cassette. both cloning vectors containing the nucmcs cassette were also introduced into streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. the potential uses  of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.

AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == different bacteriophage resistance mechanisms in streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain nst5 exhibited a temperature-dependent defence mechanism against the virulent bacteriophages phi b1.2 and phi a1.1. it was active at 42 degrees c but not at 30 degrees c as demonstrated by a significant increase of both plaque size and efficiency of plaquing. this defence mechanism did not affect host-dependent phage replication  and did not interfere with phage adsorption to nst5. these results suggest that it interfered with phage development. the phages phi t33, phi t58, phi d1, phi t21 and phi t9, belonging to the same phage type as phi b1.2, were examined for their ability to infect nst3 and nst5. restriction modification systems of different specificity were detected in nst3 and nst5; host-dependent phage replication was detected at 30 and 42 degrees c; an abortive defence mechanism was detected in nst5 which was active at 42 degrees c, but not 30 degrees c, and  was independent of restriction modification action or interference with phage adsorption. our investigations of phage-host interactions showed that the two str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains studied avoided attack by related bacteriophages by evolving at least three different resistance systems.

TI  == the 23s-5s spacer of two rrna loci of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus includes a promoter.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the 3' part of a ribosomal and transfer rna locus from streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus nst1403 was determined. the sequenced dna fragment includes the 3' end of a 23s rrna gene, a 5s rrna gene, a trna(asn)  gene and a potential transcriptional terminator. the trna gene does not encode for the cca 3'terminus of mature trna. we compared this sequence to a promoter-carrying dna fragment sequence (p20) of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus a054 [1]. we found that the p20 sequence included the 3' end of a 23s rrna gene, a 5s rrna gene and the 5' part of a trna(val) gene. the two 23s-5s spacer sequences are identical and contain a promoter and a potential 23s rrna processing site. therefore, 5s rrna and trna genes could be transcribed from a promoter located within the 23s-5s spacer of at least two of the six rrna loci.

AB  == lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar has been developed for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products. the medium contains lithium chloride  and sodium propionate to inhibit the growth of other lactic acid bacteria. pure cultures of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci were tested for growth in this medium. with one exception, all bifidobacteria were able to grow in this  medium and in a nonselective agar with a difference not exceeding .4 log units. however, none of the lactobacilli tested and only one strain each of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris grew in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar. in those cases, the numbers of colonies were lower in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar by 1.26 and 2.51 log units, respectively, compared with a nonselective agar. bifidobacteria were also selectively isolated from all fermented milks and cheeses analyzed.

TI  == evidence and characterization of temperate bacteriophage in streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus st18.
AB  == lysogenic strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were studied using induction with mitomycin c (mc). the induction and presence of temperate phage were investigated carrying out tests on sensitive strains, electron microscopy and phage dna analysis. forty-five str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains were subjected to induction with mc and growth of the various cultures was evaluated. only one strain of those tested showed lysis after adding mc, thus indicating a possible lysogenic state, 0.5 micrograms mc/ml being the optimal dose. two phi 18 phage-sensitive strains out of 45 were isolated in which this phage behaved as virulent, causing lysis of the culture in broth, but no lysis plaques on agar medium were detected. the st18 strain was cured by u.v. irradiation but no mutants sensitive to the phi 18 phage were found among the clones non-inducible by mc. the presence of phages having a hexagonal isometric head and a long non-contractile tail in the lysate obtained after inducing the st18 strain was confirmed by examination under the electron microscope. study of  the phage dna showed a genome size of 40.9 +/- 0.5 kb without cohesive end fragments. in addition, the restriction map of the phage genome was constructed.  this study has demonstrated lysogeny in str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and also that several phage infections of str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus starters may have an 'endogenous' origin.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

TI  == the presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the metabolism and genetics of streptococcus thermophilus (presently streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) have only been investigated recently  despite its widespread use in milk fermentation processes. the development of recombinant dna technology has allowed impressive progress to be made in the knowledge of thermophilic dairy streptococci. in particular, it has permitted a careful analysis of phenotypically altered variants which were derived from a mother strain by plasmid or chromosomal dna reorganization. while natural phage defense mechanisms of s. thermophilus remain poorly documented, information on the bacteriophages responsible for fermentation failures has accumulated. the lysogenic state of two s. thermophilus strains has also been demonstrated for the first time. gene transfer techniques for this species have been established and improved to the point that targeted manipulation of their chromosomal determinants is now feasible. cloning and expression vectors have been constructed, and a few heterologous genes were successfully expressed in s. thermophilus. the first homologous genes, involved in carbohydrate utilization, have been cloned and sequenced, shedding some light on the molecular organization of key metabolic steps.

AB  == cells of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly  to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. entrapped cells of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. the kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by l. lactis subsp. lactis and s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
