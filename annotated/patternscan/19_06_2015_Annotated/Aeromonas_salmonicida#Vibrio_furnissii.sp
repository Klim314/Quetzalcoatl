TI  == [taxonomic characteristics and physiological properties of microorganisms from the gut of pike (esox lucius)].
AB  == the taxonomic composition and distribution of microorganisms differing in the degree of association with the intestinal mucosa of the pike (lucius lucius) has  been studied. microorgansism of the families enterobacteriaceae, aeromonadaceae,  and vibrionaceae dominate in the gut microflora. numerically prevailing bacterial species are characterized by high proteolytic and amylolytic enzyme activities as well as by high persistence accounted for by antilysozyme and antihistone activities. the results of this study show that hafnia alvei, yersinia ruckeri, vibrio vulnificus, v. furnissii, aeromonas salmonicida, and shewanella putrefaciens may be regarded as normal components of the pike gut microflora.
