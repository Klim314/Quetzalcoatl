bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
isolation and characterization of large spectrum and multiple bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium strain from raw bovine milk.
aims: to assess the antimicrobial properties of lactic acid bacteria from tunisian raw bovine milk. methods and results: a bacteriocin-producing enterococcus faecium strain was isolated from raw cow milk with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. antimicrobial substances produced by this strain were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and were thermostable and resistant to a broad range of ph (2-10). mode of action of antimicrobial substances was determined as bactericidal. maximum activity was reached at the end of the exponential growth phase when checked against listeria ivanovii bug 496 (2366.62 au ml(-1)). however, maximum antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa 28753 was recorded at the beginning of the exponential growth phase. enterococcus faecium ggn7 was characterized as free from virulence factors and was susceptible to tested antibiotics. pcr analysis of the micro-organism's genome revealed the presence of genes coding for enterocins a and b. mass spectrometry analysis of rp-hplc active fractions showed molecular masses corresponding to enterocins a (4835.77 da) and b (5471.56 da), and a peptide with a molecular mass of 3215.5 da active only against gram-negative indicator strains. the latter was unique in the databases. conclusions: enterococcus faecium ggn7 produces three bacteriocins with different inhibitory spectra. based on its antimicrobial properties and safety, ent. faecium ggn7 is potentially useful for food biopreservation. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest the bacteriocins from ggn7 strain could be useful for food biopreservation.
impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter isolates and ampicillin-resistant non-typhoidal salmonella species in korea: a konsar study conducted in 2011.
background: antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance program (konsar). materials and methods: data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) and those admitted to other wards were compared. intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. results: escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin g-non-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. the proportion of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vr-efm) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. resistance rates of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. the prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa, mrsa, and vr-efm among icu isolates was higher than those among non-icu isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, and vr-efm were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. the resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. the proportion of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. conclusions: the prevalence of mrsa, penicillin g-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from icus. the prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant k. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. increased.
polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against eskape bacteria.
more information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (phmg) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. the bactericidal properties of phmg and chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant eskape pathogens. results showed that phmg exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp. than chg. a slight bactericidal advantage over chg was obtained against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in previous reports, phmg had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested gram-negative bacteria and several gram-positive bacteria than chg using mic test. these studies support the further development of covalently bound phmg in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of phmg in novel disinfectant formulas.
a multidisciplinary intervention to reduce infections of esbl- and ampc-producing, gram-negative bacteria at a university hospital.
in response to a considerable increase in the infections caused by esbl/ampc-producing klebsiella pneumonia in 2008, a multidisciplinary intervention, with a main focus on antimicrobial stewardship, was carried out at one university hospital. four other hospitals were used as controls. stringent guidelines for antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis were disseminated throughout the intervention hospital; cephalosporins were restricted for prophylaxis use only, fluoroquinolones for empiric use in septic shock only, and carbapenems were selected for penicillin-allergic patients, infections due to esbl/ampc-producing and other resistant bacteria, in addition to their use in severe sepsis/septic shock. piperacillin-tazobactam +/- gentamicin was recommended for empiric treatments of most febrile conditions. the intervention also included education and guidance on infection control, as well as various other surveillances. two year follow-up data on the incidence rates of patients with selected bacterial infections, outcomes, and antibiotic consumption were assessed, employing before-and-after analysis and segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series, using the other hospitals as controls. the intervention led to a sustained change in antimicrobial consumption, and the incidence of patients infected with esbl-producing k. pneumoniae decreased significantly (p<0.001). the incidences of other hospital-associated infections also declined (p's<0.02), but piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium infections increased (p's<0.033). in wards with high antimicrobial consumption, the patient gut carrier rate of esbl-producing bacteria significantly decreased (p = 0.023). the unadjusted, all-cause 30-day mortality rates of k. pneumoniae and e. coli were unchanged over the four-year period, with similar results in all five hospitals. although not statistically significant, the 30-day mortality rate of patients with esbl-producing k. pneumoniae decreased, from 35% in 2008-2009, to 17% in 2010-2011. the two-year follow-up data indicated that this multidisciplinary intervention led to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of esbl/ampc-resistant k. pneumoniae infections, as well as in the incidences of other typical hospital-associated bacterial infections.
could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against gram-positive and gram-negative isolates collected from the middle east and africa between 2004 and 2011.
the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. in this study, susceptibility among gram-positive and gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the middle east and africa was examined. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution methods. us food and drug administration (fda)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. in total, 2967 gram-positive and 6322 gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. all staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. all enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of escherichia coli and 32.9% of klebsiella pneumoniae. more than 95% of e. coli and enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. the most active agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the mic90 (mic required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against a. baumannii was low at 2mg/l. tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most gram-negative pathogens. tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most gram-positive pathogens from the middle east and africa.
synthetic analogs of anoplin show improved antimicrobial activities.
we present the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the decapeptide anoplin  and 19 analogs thereof tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus atcc 33591 (mrsa), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (atcc 700221) (vre), and candida albicans (atcc 200955). the anoplin analogs contain substitutions in amino acid positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. we use these peptides to study the effect of altering the charge and hydrophobicity of anoplin on activity against red blood cells and microorganisms. we find that increasing the charge and/or hydrophobicity improves antimicrobial activity and increases hemolytic activity. for each strain tested, we identify at least six anoplin analogs with an improved therapeutic index compared with anoplin, the only exception being enterococcus faecium, against which only few compounds are more specific than anoplin. both 2nal(6) and cha(6) show improved therapeutic index against all strains tested.
antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
new antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. in the last two decades multi drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. in this review we made an evaluation of present data regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. infectious diseases society of america (idsa) supported a program, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. the microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the main targets. in the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) and mrsa, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) but also against highly resistant gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. of these compounds some are already approved by official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.
antimicrobial activity of a uv-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) produced by enterococcus faecium strain dsh20 against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains.
background/purpose: the narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. the current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains. methods: acquired resistance profiles of enterococcus isolates determined based on the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) definition as multidrug-resistant (mdr), extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and pandrug resistant (pdr). blis activity of enterococcus isolates was investigated against enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) atcc 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including vre, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria containing pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), klebsiella, acinetobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli). results: among 273 enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 vre isolates, respectively, were xdr and pdr and eight isolates had blis activity against the indicator strain. one of these isolates, identified as e. faecium strain dsh20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, had potent blis production against all 29 vre strains, but had no activity against mrsa, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella, acinetobacter, and e. coli strains. it was heat stable up to 121 degrees c for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the ph range of 3-9 and had uv stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase k, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. it was designated as an approximately 35kda peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) method. conclusion: this peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of vre infection.
using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
[in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e. coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.
estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria finland, 2010.
background: knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (hai) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the eu, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. we assessed the burden of hais due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in finland in 2010. methods: by combining data from the national infectious disease registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the national antimicrobial resistance network and the finnish hospital infection program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant bacteria. we estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for hai in 2005. attributable hai mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. results: the estimated annual number of the most common hais due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 hais per million), 6% of all hais in finnish acute care hospitals. the number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). conclusions: resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all hais, but also in preventing all clinical infections.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
improved antibiotic-impregnated catheters with extended-spectrum activity against resistant bacteria and fungi.
minocycline-rifampin-impregnated central venous catheters (m/r cvcs) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi) and inhibiting the biofilm adherence of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. to expand the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, a novel second-generation m/r catheter was developed by adding chlorhexidine (chx-m/r). cvcs and peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs) were impregnated with chx-m/r and compared with first-generation m/r catheters, chx-silver sulfadiazine-treated cvcs (chx/ss-cvcs), chlorhexidine-treated piccs, and uncoated catheters. a biofilm catheter colonization model was used to assess the efficacy of catheters against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), p. aeruginosa, candida albicans, and candida glabrata. chx-m/r-impregnated cvcs were the only antimicrobial catheters that completely inhibited the biofilm colonization of all resistant bacterial and fungal organisms tested at all time intervals, and they were significantly superior to uncoated catheters (all p values were </=0.003). furthermore, chx-m/r-coated cvcs had a significantly more effective and prolonged (up to 3 weeks) antimicrobial activity against mrsa and p. aeruginosa than m/r, chx/ss, and uncoated cvcs (p < 0.0001). similarly, chx-m/r-coated piccs were also superior to m/r-coated and chx-coated piccs in preventing biofilms of mrsa, vre, p. aeruginosa, and candida species (p value = 0.003 for all). our study shows that novel chx-m/r-coated catheters have unique properties in completely inhibiting biofilm colonization of mrsa, vre, p. aeruginosa, and fungi in a manner superior to that of m/r- and chlorhexidine-treated catheters.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
isolation, characterization and phylogeny of sponge-associated bacteria with antimicrobial activities from brazil.
bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with antimicrobial activities from brazilian sponges. a total of 158 colony-forming units were isolated from nine sponge species. among these, 12 isolates presented antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria. based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16s rrna genes, the sponge-associated bacterial strains could be subdivided into three phylogenetically different clusters. five strains were affiliated with firmicutes (genera bacillus and virgibacillus), three with alpha-proteobacteria (pseudovibrio sp.) and four with gamma-proteobacteria (genera pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas). the sponge-associated bacterial strains pseudomonas fluorescens h40 and h41 and pseudomonas aeruginosa h51 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. bacillus pumilus pc31 and pc32, pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola pm31 and ca31 and pseudovibrio denitrificans mm37 strains were more effective against gram-positive bacteria. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the search for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
new antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit.
timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective  treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. however, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (icu) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the icu setting. indeed, a recent additional call to action by the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. the term eskape has been coined by this idsa group to refer to enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the united states that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. this article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the icu.
a longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in germany as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (2004-2007).
background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. methods: in vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). results: tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated mics for most antimicrobial agents. imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (mic(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most gram-negative pathogens but were less active against gram-positive organisms (mic(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). conclusions: tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the t.e.s.t. study. a low tigecycline mic(90) was reported against acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant enterococcus faecium,staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the carbapenems showed the lowest mic(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive e. coli. e. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
bacteriocin production by pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (scerocarya birrea).
strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.
tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.
antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
comparative review of the carbapenems.
the carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad  spectrum of activity. older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) located in renal tubules and required co-administration with a dhp-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to dhp-1 and are administered without a dhp-1 inhibitor. like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including ampc beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. resistance to carbapenems develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their pbps, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus spp. imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. as with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic). imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. the current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. the unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against p. aeruginosa than meropenem. clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including nosocomial infections.
antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.
the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs.
purpose: to determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in optisol-gs at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees c) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees c). methods: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. the first group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials. the second group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the eye bank association of america (ebaa) protocols. each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per ebaa protocol. after 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (rt) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour rt), 54 (6 hour rt), 60 (12 hour rt), 72 (24 hour rt), and 96 (48 hour rt) hours. at 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured. all samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees c. viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. results: except for the 10 cfu/ml inocula of p. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. rapid bactericidal activity was observed against p. aeruginosa after 2 hours at rt, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. the rate and extent of killing against s. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at rt with 10 cfu/ml of s. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against s. pneumoniae and e. faecium following 24 hours of storage at rt. the presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from optisol-gs after 48 hours at rt. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at rt. bactericidal activity was not observed against e. faecium at either refrigerated temperature or rt.
susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered mic values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. coli, and vre. raised mic values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against m. tuberculosis. structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower mics against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus. in contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of mics against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after 16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
in vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
the purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement samples. cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. after being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. the medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. the antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. the effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. bactericidal activity against all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. the accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. in contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.
streptomyces africanus sp. nov., a novel streptomycete with blue aerial mycelium.
an actinomycete with blue aerial mycelium and yellow substrate mycelium was isolated from a suburban soil sample collected in cape town, south africa and named strain cpjvr-ht. the colour of the substrate mycelium was not sensitive to changes in ph. the organism produced spiny spores in spirales spore chains. chemical taxonomy indicated that it is a member of the genus streptomyces. strain cpjvr-ht grew at 45 degrees c and did not produce melanin or any diffusible pigments. it exhibited weak antibacterial activity against a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium, but no antibacterial activity against escherichia coli atcc 25922 or pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. analysis of its 16s rrna gene sequence, dna-dna hybridization studies and the results of physiological tests showed that this strain represents a novel species of streptomyces, for which the name corynebacterium aurimucosum [corrected] nov. is proposed. the type strain is cpjvr-ht (= nrrl b-24243t [corrected] = dsm 41829t).
[nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
[activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in japan].
a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%. however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis, the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.
in vitro activity of gatifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin and gentamicin against multidrug-resistant organisms.
objectives: to study the in vitro interaction of gatifloxacin in combination with gentamicin and with the beta-lactams cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin against clinical isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods: the activity of each drug alone was determined by an agar dilution method. chequerboard synergy testing was then performed against all the isolates. time-kill assays were done on selected isolates to assess correlation with the chequerboard results. results: synergy was demonstrated with the following combinations at achievable serum concentrations: gatifloxacin/piperacillin for 80% and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 60% of s. maltophilia; gatifloxacin/gentamicin for 60%, and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 50% of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and in all drug combinations for 50-70% of p. aeruginosa. indifference was noted for the majority of b. cepacia and vre isolates. antagonism at therapeutic serum levels was observed with gatifloxacin/piperacillin against a single isolate of b. cepacia. no distinct trend in drug interaction was seen with the different drug combinations against mrsa. time-kill analyses against selected isolates confirmed the synergic activity of the following drug combinations seen in the chequerboard assays: gatifloxacin/cefepime and gatifloxacin/piperacillin against p. aeruginosa, gatifloxacin/gentamicin against b. cepacia, and gatifloxacin/gentamicin and gatifloxacin/meropenem against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae. conclusions: gatifloxacin was synergic with the beta-lactams piperacillin, cefepime and meropenem, and with gentamicin against some drug-resistant pathogens. some of the time-kill analyses against p. aeruginosa, b. cepacia and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae were in accordance with chequerboard results. time-kill analyses against s. maltophilia did not confirm the synergy seen in chequerboard testing.
in vitro antibacterial activities of dq-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of dq-113, formerly d61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (mic90s) of dq-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. moreover, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, with a mic90 of 0.25microg/ml. dq-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and dq-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with mic90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, dq-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a mic range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. dq-113 also showed a potent activity against haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (mic90, 0.015 microg/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.03 microg/ml). the activity of dq-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of enterobacteriaceae: the mics of dq-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. from these results, dq-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
multicenter evaluation of an automated system using selected bacteria that harbor challenging and clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics.
a multicenter study was carried out to evaluate the performance of a new commercial automated system in comparison with that of the reference agar dilution method. ten clinical microbiology laboratories tested a collection of 61 strains of gram-negative bacilli (49 enterobacteriaceae and 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa), and 6 other laboratories tested a collection of 55 strains of gram-positive cocci (10 enterococci and 45 staphylococci) against 10-20 antimicrobial agents. the strains were selected on the basis that they harbored challenging and characterized mechanisms of resistance. in comparison with the agar reference method, the automated system gave an overall essential agreement (+/-1 dilution) of 94.5%, 93.5%, and 97% for the gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococci, respectively. according to the interpretive standards of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards, the category agreement ranged from 96 to 96.4% for the three sets of organisms. the accuracy of the automated system, as determined by the kappa test, ranged from 0.80 to 0.88, reflecting an almost perfect agreement with the reference technique. very major, major, and minor errors obtained with the automated system were 0.3%, 2.9%, and 6.6% for gram-negative bacilli, 3.4%, 0%, and 5% for enterococci, and 1%, 1.6%, and 2.7% for staphylococci, respectively. the high rate of very major errors in enterococci was mostly due to a single strain of multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium, which was found susceptible to several antibiotics in a majority of participant laboratories. the use of a heavy inoculum and of a broth test medium by the automated system might account for a better expression of certain resistance mechanisms, including beta-lactamases, as compared to the agar dilution reference method. the interlaboratory reproducibility was acceptable, as shown by the narrow dispersion of mics and by the results of quality control.
an in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
objective: to evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. study design: cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group b streptococcus and escherichia coli. results: in the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, e coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. in the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group b streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/ml of gentamicin and toward e coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/ml of gentamicin. conclusion: a low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new carbapenem, e1010, and tentative disc diffusion test interpretative criteria.
the susceptibility of 705 bacterial isolates representing 46 different species to e1010 (er-35786), imipenem, meropenem and cefepime was determined by the nccls broth microdilution test. the mic(90)s for e1010 were < or =1.0 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, fastidious gram-negative bacteria, streptococci and anaerobes. e1010 was two- to four-fold more active than imipenem and meropenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four-fold more active than the other carbapenems against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin-resistant enterococci and most enterococcus faecium were resistant to all four drugs tested. the nccls disc diffusion test was performed simultaneously on the non-fastidious organisms. assuming the mic breakpoints for e1010 will be the same as for the other carbapenems, the disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints of imipenem and meropenem would also be applicable to e1010.
in vitro and in vivo properties of ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium. its mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was 4 microg/ml. ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against mrsa. development of resistance to the new compound in mrsa was not observed. ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml). it was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and against enterobacteriaceae except proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. the basis for the antibacterial spectrum of ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including pbp 2' of mrsa, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. the in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. these data suggest the potential utility of ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including mrsa. since insufficient solubility of ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble prodrug, ro 65-5788, is considered for development.
antibacterial spectrum of a novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone, bms-284756.
the in vitro spectrum of a novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone, bms-284756, was compared with those of five fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin). bms-284756 was among the most active and often was the most active quinolone against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci, pneumococci (including ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible and penicillin-resistant strains), and enterococcus faecalis. bms-284756 inhibited approximately 60 to approximately 70% of the enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant) strains and 90 to 100% of the enterobacteriaceae strains and gastroenteric bacillary pathogens at the anticipated mic susceptible breakpoint (</=4 microg/ml). against the nonfermenters, bms-284756 inhibited 90 to 100% of pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas stutzeri, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, flavobacterium spp., and acinetobacter spp. and 72% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains at 4 microg/ml. against anaerobic bacteria, bms-284756 was among the most active, inhibiting essentially all strains tested. it had very low mics against the fastidious and atypical microbial species, in particular against mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia, and gonococci. these results indicate that with its broad antibacterial spectrum, bms-284756 should be evaluated clinically for the treatment of community and nosocomial infections.

objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts: an in vitro study.
the aim of this study was to investigate the binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts and to examine its antimicrobial activity against various microbial pathogens in vitro. vascular grafts made by intergard (intervascular), fluoropassiv (vascutek), and gore-tex (gore) were examined. grafts were incubated in 10 g/l triclosan (irgasan), dried, sterilized, and incubated in rpmi medium. one-centimeter segments of the grafts were resected under sterile conditions at intervals of minutes, then hours, followed by days and up to 4 weeks. samples were stored frozen at -20 degrees c for the measurement of triclosan bound to the vascular graft by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the binding kinetics under perfusion conditions were determined for intergard grafts, which were perfused with 50 ml of nutrient medium for 24 hr. samples were taken at various time intervals for the measurement of triclosan. the antimicrobial activity of triclosan against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans as well as enterococcus faecium was determined. triclosan effectively binds to vascular graft without the use of intermediate binding substances. it stayed on the graft for the duration of 4 weeks. under both static and perfusion conditions, the binding kinetics are similar. triclosan binds most effectively to intergard grafts, less so to fluoropassiv grafts, and not at all to gore-tex material. antimicrobial activity of triclosan is very effective against s. aureus and e. faecium but not against p. aeruginosa.
united states geographic bacteria susceptibility patterns. 1997 ascp susceptibility testing group.
antimicrobial drug resistance in bacterial pathogens continues, with 1997 seeing  reports of staphylococcus aureus no longer fully susceptible to vancomycin occurring in the united states. to better deal with this rapidly developing problem, we present the third year of united states national data that highlights the geographic nature of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. in 1997, we observed increasing numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, more methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and an apparent spreading of penicillin resistance in pneumococci. the majority of reporting sites now indicates that over 20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa are fully resistant to ciprofloxacin, the only oral agent available for treating this pathogen. with increasing resistance coming at a time of decreasing available resources, it is more clear than ever before that the future of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology remains filled with challenge.
in vitro antibacterial properties of pexiganan, an analog of magainin.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the african clawed frog. pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the pexiganan mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, corynebacterium spp., pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium spp. comparison of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, mbcs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the mics, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. no evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the mic50s and the mic90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. in conclusion, pexiganan exhibits properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.
study of rapidity and quality for the vitek susceptibility cards with 45 wells.
vitek 45 wells card was evaluated. recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci (107) and gram-negative bacilli (179) were antimicrobial susceptibility testing by vitek system in comparison with mic-2000 system. the antimicrobial susceptibility results were available within of 8 h for gram-positive cocci without a part of mrsa. enterobac-teriaceae were available within of 8 h and pseudomonas aeruginosa were from 8 to 11 h. the antimicrobial susceptibility data had disagreement of 60% with em, 46% with cldm for enterococcus faecium, 50% with cmz for citrobacter freundii, and 71% with ctm for morganella morganii, whereas it was satisfactory agreement of 97.5% for gram-positive cocci and 98.2% for gram-negative bacilli. in using this procedure it was possible to provide accurate and rapid results of anti-microbial susceptibility tests for all organisms.
dissecting the vanrs signal transduction pathway with specific inhibitors.
the vanrs two-component signal transduction pathway from enterococcus faecium was reconstituted in vitro from partially purified components and shown to be inhibited by the halophenyl isothiazolone ly-266,400, inhibitor a, a compound shown previously to reduce expression of the algr1-algr2 two-component signal transduction pathway in pseudomonas aeruginosa (s. roychoudhury, n. a. zielinski, a. j. ninfa, n. e. allen, l. n. jungheim, t. i. nicas, and a. m. chakrabarty, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 90:965-969, 1993). inhibitor a attenuates phosphoryl transfer from vans approximately p to vanr by its action on the ability of vanr to accept. we observed an apparent stimulatory effect of inhibitor a on vans autophosphorylation which is attributable to the accumulation of vans approximately p as an intermediate unable to transfer pi to the inhibited vanr. thus, inhibitor a acts on the second of two sequential steps which lead to transcriptional activation of the vanhaxyz gene cluster and the resultant expression of vancomycin resistance.
antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
we investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated from the stomach of the dogfish shark. the mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and fungi. some had little or no hemolytic activity. the hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. one of the squalamine mimics, sm-7, was bactericidal against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and s. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. subinhibitory concentrations of sm-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. these results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. the antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. the squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as topical antimicrobial agents.
comparison of antimicrobial properties of monoterpenes and their carbonylated products.
some monoterpenes and their carbonylated products were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. the carbonylation of tested monoterpenes was shown to increase the bacteriostatic and fungistatic activities specifically by the contact method. concerning the killing effects, only (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol, its carbonylated products, and (r)-carvone showed significant bactericidal activities, particularly against enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli above a concentration of 10 microliters/ml. a fungicidal efficiency of (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol and (r)-carvone against aspergillus niger was also noted. it seems that the presence of an oxygenated function in the framework increases the antimicrobial properties. however, monoterpenes were more active using a micro-atmosphere method.
[nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for s. aureus and cns.
[bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. ii. relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
the bactericidal activity of magainins against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium.
the antimicrobial activities of two synthetic magainins, msi 94 and msi 93, were  investigated in vitro against 20 clinical isolates each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium. the ranges of the mics of both agents were 6.25-50 mg/l for p. aeruginosa and 3.13-12.5 mg/l for e. faecium. in time-kill studies, the magainins demonstrated rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against selected isolates of both species. this bactericidal effect was inoculum-dependent for p. aeruginosa in both the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth. bacterial regrowth was regularly observed after 24 h of incubation in the time-kill studies; this was due to loss of antimicrobial activity during overnight incubation rather than to the development of resistance. more rapid and sustained bactericidal activity was noted when the magainins were combined with either silver nitrate (agno3) or gentamicin against p. aeruginosa and with gentamicin against e. faecium. neither agent produced a post-antibiotic effect on p. aeruginosa.
antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
[clinical features of enterococcal septicemia and antimicrobial susceptibilities  for clinical isolates of enterococci in nagoya university hospital].
enterococci are important causative organisms of nosocomial infections as well as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterococcal bacteremia has been increased in nagoya university hospital from april 1983 to march 1990. we analyzed the clinical backgrounds, portal of entry and mortality for the patients with enterococcal septicemia. thirty-four cases with enterococcal septicemia (24 enterococcus faecalis, 10 enterococcus faecium) were subjected in this study. twenty-seven cases were monomicrobial septicemia and 7 cases were polymicrobial septicemia. as to the portal of entry, intra-abdominal infections in 21 cases, urinary tract infections in 4 cases, respiratory tract infections or chest tubes in 2 cases, decbitus infection in 1 case, intravascular catheter in 1 case, and unknown sources in 5 cases. total mortality of the septicemia was 44.1%. e. faecium and enterococcus avium were much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than e. faecalis. enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) accounted for 35% of the 26 clinical isolates of enterococci.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
