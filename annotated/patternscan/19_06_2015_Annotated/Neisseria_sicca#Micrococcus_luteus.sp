TI  == isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in dammam  in eastern saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: this study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of dammam, in the eastern region of saudi arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. materials and methods: the analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. results: there were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria sicca, micrococcus luteus, proteus mirabilis, bacillus subtilis, and enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. there were fungal isolates as follows: alternaria alternata, aspergillus niger, cladosporium sp., penicillium spp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, rhizopus stolonifer, aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. conclusions: the study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to  the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. this means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.

TI  == plasmid mediated antibiotic resistance in marine bacteria.
AB  == this research work was conducted in uppanar estuary to ascertain the role of plasmids in the antibiotic resistance of bacteria. water and sediment samples were collected for a period of three months. when tested against 20 antibiotics 22 mar strains were isolated from the samples, which were found resistant to 5-13 antibiotics. they belong to 7 genera and 10 species. gram-negative bacteria namely neisseria mucosa, n. sicca, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella ozaenae, citrobacterintermedius, pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes were isolated. gram-positive bacteria were of bacillus subtilis, b. megaterium and micrococcus luteus. when plasmid curing was done using acredine orange, the resistance against penicillin-g, ampicillin, tetracycline, amoxycillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were totally lost in all strains, which confirmed  the role of plasmid in these strains against antibiotics. ten strains belong to different species were selected for the plasmid isolation and electrophoresis was done. presence of plasmids in all strains was confirmed and the molecular weight  was in the range of 2850 to 3170 bp. the study revealed that mar strains are common in uppanar estuary and they are plasmid mediated. this environment is seemed to be deteriorating at an alarming rate.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
