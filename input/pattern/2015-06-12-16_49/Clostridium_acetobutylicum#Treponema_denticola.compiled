TI  - Metabolic engineering of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 for 1-butanol production.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Butanol is a promising next generation fuel and a bulk chemical precursor. Although clostridia are the primary industrial microbes for the fermentative production of 1-butanol, alternative engineered hosts have the potential to generate 1-butanol from alternative carbon feedstocks via synthetic metabolic pathways. Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a facultative methylotrophic alpha-proteobacterium, is a model system for assessing the possibility of generating products such as 1-butanol from one-carbon and two-carbon feedstocks. Moreover, the core methylotrophic pathways in M. extorquens AM1 involve unusual coenzyme A (CoA)-derivative metabolites, such as crotonyl-CoA, which is a precursor for the production of 1-butanol. RESULTS: In this work, we engineered a modified CoA-dependent pathway in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 to produce 1-butanol. Engineered strains displayed different 1-butanol titers using ethylamine as a substrate. A strain overexpressing Treponema denticola trans-enoyl-CoA reductase, Clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase, and native crotonase was able to generate the highest 1-butanol titer (15.2 mg l(-1)). In vitro isotopic tracing of metabolic flux and in vivo metabolite analysis showed the accumulation of butyryl-CoA, demonstrating the functionality of the synthetic pathway and identifying targets for future improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of using metabolic intermediates of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway in M. extorquens AM1 to generate value-added chemicals, with 1-butanol as the test case. This will not only establish the biotechnological potential of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway, but will also introduce M. extorquens AM1 as a potential platform to produce value-added chemicals.
TI  - Butyrate production in engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic scaffolds.
AB  - Butyrate pathway was constructed in recombinant Escherichia coli using the genes  from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Treponema denticola. However, the pathway constructed from exogenous enzymes did not efficiently convert carbon flux to butyrate. Three steps of the productivity enhancement were attempted in this study. First, pathway engineering to delete metabolic pathways to by-products successfully improved the butyrate production. Second, synthetic scaffold protein that spatially co-localizes enzymes was introduced to improve the efficiency of the heterologous pathway enzymes, resulting in threefold improvement in butyrate production. Finally, further optimizations of inducer concentrations and pH adjustment were tried. The final titer of butyrate was 4.3 and 7.2 g/L under batch and fed-batch cultivation, respectively. This study demonstrated the importance of synthetic scaffold protein as a useful tool for optimization of heterologous butyrate pathway in E. coli.
TI  - Structures of trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductases from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Treponema denticola: insights into the substrate specificity and the catalytic mechanism.
AB  - TERs (trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductases; EC 1.3.1.44), which specifically catalyse the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA using NADH as cofactor, have recently been applied in the design of robust synthetic pathways to produce butan-1-ol as a biofuel. We report in the present paper the characterization of a CaTER (a TER homologue in Clostridium acetobutylicum), the structures of CaTER in apo form and in complexes with NADH and NAD+, and the structure of TdTER (Treponema denticola TER) in complex with NAD+. Structural and sequence comparisons show that CaTER and TdTER share approximately 45% overall sequence identity and high structural similarities with the FabV class enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases in the bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathway, suggesting that both types of enzymes belong to the same family. CaTER and TdTER function as monomers and consist of a cofactor-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain with the catalytic active site located at the interface of the two domains. Structural analyses of CaTER together with mutagenesis and biochemical data indicate that the conserved Glu75 determines the cofactor specificity, and the conserved Tyr225, Tyr235 and Lys244 play critical roles in catalysis. Upon cofactor binding, the substrate-binding loop changes from an open conformation to a closed conformation, narrowing a hydrophobic channel to the catalytic site. A modelling study shows that the hydrophobic channel is optimal in both width and length for the binding of crotonyl-CoA. These results provide molecular bases for the high substrate specificity and the catalytic mechanism of TERs.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for 1-butanol production from carbon dioxide.
AB  - Production of chemicals and fuels directly from CO(2) is an attractive approach to solving the energy and environmental problems. 1-Butanol, a chemical feedstock and potential fuel, has been produced by fermentation of carbohydrates, both in native Clostridium species and various engineered hosts. To produce 1-butanol from CO(2), we transferred a modified CoA-dependent 1-butanol production pathway into a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We demonstrated the activity of each enzyme in the pathway by chromosomal integration and expression of the genes. In particular, Treponema denticola trans-enoyl-CoA reductase (Ter), which utilizes NADH as the reducing power, was used for the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA instead of Clostridium acetobutylicum butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase to by-pass the need of Clostridial ferredoxins. Addition of polyhistidine-tag increased the overall activity of Ter and resulted in higher 1-butanol production. Removal of oxygen is an important factor in the synthesis of 1-butanol in this organism. This result represents the first autotrophic 1-butanol production.
