TI  == hydrophobicities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and oral bacteroides and porphyromonas spp., wolinella recta, and eubacterium yurii with special reference to bacterial surface structures.
AB  == the hydrophobicities of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls) and bacteroides buccae, b. oris, b. oralis, b. veroralis, b. buccalis, b. heparinolyticus, b. intermedius, b. denticola, b. loescheii, b. melaninogenicus,  porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, wolinella recta, and eubacterium yurii were studied by the hexadecane method. the majority of the strains were equally or less hydrophobic than the pmnls. only in the case of e. yurii and the only strain of b. buccalis were all strains more hydrophobic than the pmnls. however,  some strains of b. intermedius, b. oris, b. denticola, and p. gingivalis were also more hydrophobic than the pmnls. with the exception of b. intermedius and species with a crystalline surface protein layer (s-layer), the strains of all other species with a thick capsule were more hydrophilic than the strains with little or no extracellular polymeric material. all strains of the s-layer species were either quite hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the species, totally irrespective of the presence of the capsule. the results suggest that the s-layers of oral anaerobic bacteria may be important determinants of cell surface hydrophobicity.
