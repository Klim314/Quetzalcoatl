TI  == enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated  uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of  antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by  multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women.  on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the  different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti  with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st  16 in acute uti.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in european hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance  (2003-2009).
AB  == daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the european medicines agency (emea) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cssti) and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro  activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). a total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 european  countries, turkey and israel. the collection included s. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [mrsa]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 6,874), enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107).  the organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cssti (23%). daptomycin was very active against s. aureus and cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. all enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (mic(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). daptomycin (mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and s. bovis (mic(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).in summary, daptomycin was very  potent against this large collection (36,769) of gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period  evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since emea approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary gram-positive species.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == transferable vanb2 tn5382-containing elements in fecal streptococcal strains from veal calves.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanb2 tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. one s. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp is256-related element inserted in vans(b). the vanb2 tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free s. lutetiensis strain was transferable to enterococcus faecium bm4105-rf, enterococcus faecalis jh2-2, and  its recombination-deficient derivative, uv202. the transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). all transconjugants acquired a vanb-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. these observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might  be involved in the interspecies spread of vanb2 resistance determinants. two jh2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanb-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.
