TI  == outer membrane protein p4 is not required for virulence in the human challenge model of haemophilus ducreyi infection.
AB  == background: bacterial lipoproteins often play important roles in pathogenesis and can stimulate protective immune responses. such lipoproteins are viable vaccine candidates. haemophilus ducreyi, which causes the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, expresses a number of lipoproteins during human infection. one such lipoprotein, ompp4, is homologous to the outer membrane lipoprotein e (p4) of h.  influenzae. in h. influenzae, e (p4) stimulates production of bactericidal and protective antibodies and contributes to pathogenesis by facilitating acquisition of the essential nutrients heme and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad). here, we tested the hypothesis that, like its homolog, h. ducreyi ompp4 contributes to virulence and stimulates production of bactericidal antibodies. results: we determined that ompp4 is broadly conserved among clinical isolates of h. ducreyi. we next constructed and characterized an isogenic ompp4 mutant, designated 35000hpompp4, in h. ducreyi strain 35000hp. to test whether ompp4 was  necessary for virulence in humans, eight healthy adults were experimentally infected. each subject was inoculated with a fixed dose of 35000hp on one arm and three doses of 35000hpompp4 on the other arm. the overall parent and mutant pustule formation rates were 52.4% and 47.6%, respectively (p = 0.74). these results indicate that expression of ompp4 in not necessary for h. ducreyi to initiate disease or progress to pustule formation in humans. hyperimmune mouse serum raised against purified, recombinant ompp4 did not promote bactericidal killing of 35000hp or phagocytosis by j774a.1 mouse macrophages in serum bactericidal and phagocytosis assays, respectively. conclusions: our data suggest that, unlike e (p4), h. ducreyi ompp4 is not a suitable vaccine candidate. ompp4  may be dispensable for virulence because of redundant mechanisms in h. ducreyi for heme acquisition and nad utilization.

TI  == trimeric autotransporter dsra is a major mediator of fibrinogen binding in haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease chancroid. in both natural and experimental chancroid, h. ducreyi colocalizes with fibrin at the base of the ulcer. fibrin is obtained by cleavage  of the serum glycoprotein fibrinogen (fg) by thrombin to initiate formation of the blood clot. fg binding proteins are critical virulence factors in medically important gram-positive bacteria. h. ducreyi has previously been shown to bind fg in an agglutination assay, and the h. ducreyi fg binding protein fgba was identified in ligand blotting with denatured proteins. to better characterize the interaction of h. ducreyi with fg, we examined fg binding to intact, viable h. ducreyi bacteria and identified a novel fg binding protein. h. ducreyi bound unlabeled fg in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by two different methods. in ligand blotting with total denatured cellular proteins, digoxigenin (dig)-fg bound only two h. ducreyi proteins, the trimeric autotransporter dsra and the lectin dlta; however, only the isogenic dsra mutant had significantly less cell-associated fg than parental strains in fg binding assays with intact bacteria. furthermore, expression of dsra, but not dlta or an empty vector, rendered the non-fg-binding h. influenzae strain rd capable of binding fg. a 13-amino-acid sequence in the c-terminal section of the passenger domain of dsra  appears to be involved in fg binding by h. ducreyi. taken together, these data suggest that the trimeric autotransporter dsra is a major determinant of fg binding at the surface of h. ducreyi.

TI  == genetics and molecular specificity of sialylation of histophilus somni lipooligosaccharide (los) and the effect of los sialylation on toll-like receptor-4 signaling.
AB  == histophilus somni is an etiologic agent of bovine respiratory and systemic diseases. most pathogenic strains of h. somni that have been tested (36 of 42) are able to utilize n-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid (neu5ac) to sialylate their lipooligosaccharide (los). homologs of all the genes required for transport, metabolism, and regulation of neu5ac in haemophilus influenzae were identified in the sequenced genomes of h. somni. three open reading frames (orfs) in h. somni strain 2336 were identified that contained homology to genes required for los sialylation in related bacteria. orf-1 (hsst-i), orf-2 (hsst-ii), and orf-3 (neua(hs)) were predicted to encode for putative proteins with 37% amino acid homology to an alpha-(2-3)-sialyltransferase in h. influenzae, 43% amino acid homology to an haemophilus ducreyi sialyltransferase, and 72% amino acid homology to an h. influenzae cmp-neu5ac synthetase, respectively. the specific enzyme activity of each orf was determined using synthetic acceptor substrates. the hsst-i sialyltransferase primarily sialylated n-acetyllactosamine (lacnac, gal-beta-[1-4]-glcnac-r), which is expressed on strain 2336, whereas hsst-ii preferentially sialylated lacto-n-biose (lnb, gal-beta-[1-3]-glcnac-r), which is  expressed on a phase variant of strain 2336: strain 738. phase variation of the terminal galactose linkage in strain 738 from beta-(1-3)-(lnb) to beta-(1-4)-(lacnac) was confirmed using monoclonal antibody reactivity and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. sialylated los induced significantly less chemokine response from macrophages derived from toll-like receptor (tlr)-4  knockout mice than from de-sialylated los. furthermore, sialylated los induced significantly less nf-kappab activity from mouse-derived bone marrow macrophages  than de-sialylated los. therefore, sialylation inhibited los signaling through tlr-4. in conclusion, h. somni utilizes linkage-specific sialyltransferases to sialylate its los to avoid innate host defense mechanisms despite simultaneous epitope phase variation.

TI  == haemophilus species
AB  == the genus haemophilus includes a number of species that cause a wide variety of infections but share a common morphology and a requirement for blood-derived factors during growth that has given the genus its name. haemophilus influenzae,  the major pathogen, can be separated into encapsulated or typable strains, of which there are seven types (a through f including e') based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide, and unencapsulated or nontypable strains. type b h influenzae is by far the most virulent organism in this group,  commonly causing bloodstream invasion and meningitis in children younger than 2 years. nontypable strains are frequent causes of respiratory tract disease in infants, children, and adults. other haemophilus species cause disease less frequently. haemophilus parainfluenzae sometimes causes pneumonia or bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. haemophilus aphrophilus is a  member of the normal flora of the mouth and occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis. haemophilus aegyptius, which causes conjunctivitis and brazilian purpuric fever, and haemophilus haemolyticus used to be separated on the basis of their ability to agglutinate or lyse red blood cells, but both are now included among the nontypable h influenzae strains.

TI  == identification and characterization of a heme periplasmic-binding protein in haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative and heme-dependent bacterium, is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer sexually transmitted infection. heme acquisition in h. ducreyi proceeds via a receptor mediated process in which  the initial event involves binding of hemoglobin and heme to their cognate outer  membrane proteins, hgba and tdha, respectively. following this specific interaction, the fate of the periplasmic deposited heme is unclear. using protein expression profiling of the h. ducreyi periplasmic proteome, a periplasmic-binding protein, termed hhbp, was identified whose expression was enhanced under heme-limited conditions. the gene encoding this protein was situated in a locus displaying genetic characteristics of an abc transporter. the purified protein bound heme in a dose-dependent and saturable manner and this binding was specifically competitively inhibited by heme. the hhbp gene functionally complemented an escherichia coli heme uptake mutant. expression of the heme periplasmic-binding protein was detected in a limited survey of h. ducreyi and h. influenzae clinical strains. these results indicate that the passage of heme into the cytoplasm of h. ducreyi involves a heme dedicated abc transporter.

TI  == haemophilus ducreyi sapa contributes to cathelicidin resistance and virulence in  humans.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is an extracellular pathogen of human epithelial surfaces that resists human antimicrobial peptides (aps). the organism's genome contains homologs of genes sensitive to antimicrobial peptides (sap operon) in nontypeable haemophilus influenzae. in this study, we characterized the sap-containing loci of h. ducreyi 35000hp and demonstrated that sapa is expressed in broth cultures and h. ducreyi-infected tissue; sapa is also conserved among both class i and class ii h. ducreyi strains. we constructed a nonpolar sapa mutant of h. ducreyi  35000hp, designated 35000hpsapa, and compared the percent survival of wild-type 35000hp and 35000hpsapa exposed to several human aps, including alpha-defensins,  beta-defensins, and the cathelicidin ll-37. unlike an h. influenzae sapa mutant,  strain 35000hpsapa was not more susceptible to defensins than strain 35000hp was. however, we observed a significant decrease in the survival of strain 35000hpsapa after exposure to ll-37, which was complemented by introducing sapa in trans. thus, the sap transporter plays a role in resistance of h. ducreyi to ll-37. we next compared mutant strain 35000hpsapa with strain 35000hp for their ability to  cause disease in human volunteers. although both strains caused papules to form at similar rates, the pustule formation rate at sites inoculated with 35000hpsapa was significantly lower than that of sites inoculated with 35000hp (33.3% versus  66.7%; p = 0.007). together, these data establish that sapa acts as a virulence factor and as one mechanism for h. ducreyi to resist killing by antimicrobial peptides. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an antimicrobial peptide resistance mechanism contributes to bacterial virulence in humans.

TI  == new plasmid tools for genetic analysis of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  == we have generated a set of plasmids, based on the mobilizable shuttle vector pmidg100, which can be used as tools for genetic manipulation of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other members of the pasteurellaceae. a tandem reporter plasmid, pmc-tandem, carrying promoterless xyle and gfpmut3 genes downstream of a multiple-cloning site (mcs), can be used for identification of transcriptional regulators and conditions which favor gene expression from different cloned promoters. the ability to detect transcriptional regulators using the tandem reporter system was validated in a. pleuropneumoniae using the cloned rpoe (sigma(e)) promoter (p). the resulting plasmid, pmcrpoep, was used to identify a  mutant defective in production of rsea, the negative regulator of sigma(e), among a bank of random transposon mutants, as well as to detect induction of sigma(e) following exposure of a. pleuropneumoniae to ethanol or heat shock. pmcsodcp, carrying the cloned sodc promoter of a. pleuropneumoniae, was functional in a. pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parasuis, mannheimia haemolytica, and pasteurella multocida. two general expression vectors, pmk-express and pmc-express, which differ in their antibiotic resistance markers  (kanamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively), were constructed for the pasteurellaceae. both plasmids have the a. pleuropneumoniae sodc promoter upstream of the gfpmut3 gene and an extended mcs. replacement of gfpmut3 with a gene of interest allows complementation and heterologous gene expression, as evidenced by expression of the haemophilus ducreyi nadv gene in a. pleuropneumoniae, rendering the latter nad independent.

TI  == molecular phylogenetic analysis of tryptophanyl-trna synthetase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == aminoacyl-trna synthetase family enzymes are of particular interest for creating  universal phylogenetic trees and understanding the gene flow as these enzymes perform the basic and analogous biochemical function of protein synthesis in all  extant organisms. among them, tryptophanyl-trna synthetase (trp-rs) plays a foremost role in phylogeny owing to the close relationship with tyrosine-trna synthetase. in this study, the sequence of the gene trp-rs was amplified using degenerated adenylation domain primers in the periodontal bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the sequence of the cloned pcr amplicon confirmed the adenylation domain sequence with glutamic acid residue, which is absent in five other oral bacteria used in this study as well as in a number of other bacteria described in the database. the trp-rs sequence analysis prevailed  the identify elements such as rossmann-fold sequence and trna(trp) binding domains including acceptor stem and anticodon. a theoretical model of trp-rs of a. actinomycetemcomitans was generated. guided docking of the ligand tryptophanyl-5'-amp revealed a highly identical active site in comparison with the bacterial template. the phylogenetic positioning of trp-rs among a group of oral bacterial species revealed that a. actinomycetemcomitans is closely related  to haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == outer membrane protein dsra is the major fibronectin-binding determinant of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == the ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins is a critical virulence determinant for skin pathogens. haemophilus ducreyi, the etiological agent of the genital ulcer disease chancroid, binds extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin (fn). we investigated h. ducreyi fn binding and report several important findings about this interaction. first, fn binding by h. ducreyi was greatly increased in bacteria grown on heme and almost completely inhibited by hemoglobin. second, wild-type strain 35000hp bound significantly more fn than did a dsra mutant in two different fn binding assays. third, the expression of dsra in the dsra mutant restored fn binding and conferred the ability to bind fn to a  non-fn-binding haemophilus influenzae strain. fourth, an anti-dsra monoclonal antibody partially blocked fn binding by h. ducreyi. the hemoglobin receptor, the collagen-binding protein, the h. ducreyi lectin, the fine-tangle pili, and the outer membrane protein ompa2 were not involved in h. ducreyi fn binding, since single mutants bound fn as well as the parent strain did. however, the major outer membrane protein may have a minor role in fn binding by h. ducreyi, since a double dsra momp mutant bound less fn than did the single dsra mutant. finally, despite major sequence differences, dsra proteins from both class i and class ii  h. ducreyi strains mediated fn and vitronectin binding. we concluded that dsra is the major factor involved in fn binding by both classes of h. ducreyi strains.

TI  == evidence that the cytolethal distending toxin locus was once part of a genomic island in the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans strain y4.
AB  == the authors have previously shown that the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans y4 contains an operon for a genotoxin known as the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). the cdt locus in strain y4 is flanked by remnants of heterologous plasmid and integrase sequences. in this study, the dna sequence immediately downstream from the cdt locus on the y4  chromosome was examined. the extended sequence contained a region that had all the characteristics of a typical bacterial pathogenicity or genomic island. the genomic island (giy4-1) was approximately 22 kb long, was flanked by a bacteriophage attachment (att) sequence and contained a full-length integrase/resolvase gene (xerd). a total of 22 complete and partial orfs represented putative dna replication/dna binding/conjugation proteins as well as  hypothetical proteins. giy4-1 was most closely related to putative genomic islands in haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp and haemophilus influenzae 86-028np and to a chromosomal region in haemophilus somnus 129pt. giy4-1 was not present in hk1651, which was used as the prototype strain for genomic sequencing of a. actinomycetemcomitans. several sequences in giy4-1 were homologous to orfs found  on the a. actinomycetemcomitans plasmid pvt745. none of the identified orfs in giy4-1 appeared to encode potential virulence genes. however, several unique observations supported the possibility that the cdt locus of a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 was originally contained within the genomic island.

TI  == complete genome sequence of haemophilus somnus (histophilus somni) strain 129pt and comparison to haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp and haemophilus influenzae rd.
AB  == haemophilus somnus can be either a commensal of bovine mucosal surfaces or an opportunistic pathogen. pathogenic strains of h. somnus are a significant cause of systemic disease in cattle. we report the genome sequence of h. somnus 129pt,  a nonpathogenic commensal preputial isolate, and the results of a genome-wide comparative analysis of h. somnus 129pt, haemophilus influenzae rd, and haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp. we found unique genes in h. somnus 129pt involved in lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis, carbohydrate uptake and metabolism, cation transport, amino acid metabolism, ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis, cell surface adhesion, biosynthesis of cofactors, energy metabolism, and electron transport. there were also many genes in common among the three organisms. our comparative analyses of h. somnus 129pt, h. influenzae rd, and h. ducreyi 35000hp revealed similarities and differences in the numbers and compositions of genes involved in metabolism, host colonization, and persistence. these results lay a foundation for research on the host specificities and niche preferences of these  organisms. future comparisons between h. somnus 129pt and virulent strains will aid in the development of protective strategies and vaccines to protect cattle against h. somnus disease.

TI  == evolution of competence and dna uptake specificity in the pasteurellaceae.
AB  == background: many bacteria can take up dna, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence and transformation remain obscure. the sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. additional insight may come from the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence (uss) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient dna uptake. we used the distribution of competence genes and dna uptake specificity in h. influenzae's family, the pasteurellaceae, to examine the ancestry of competence. results: a phylogeny of the pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the hin subclade (h. influenzae, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia succiniciproducens, and h. somnus), and the apl subclade (a. pleuropneumoniae, m. haemolytica, and h. ducreyi). all species contained homologues of all known h. influenzae competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. competence gene defects were identified in three  species (h. somnus, h. ducreyi and m. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin. the assumption that uss arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of h. influenzae proteins with distant homologues. abundant uss-like repeats were found in all eight pasteurellacean genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the hin subclade were identical to that of h. influenzae (aagtgcggt), whereas members of the apl subclade shared the consensus  acaagcggt. all species' usss had the strong consensus and flanking at-rich repeats of h. influenzae usss. dna uptake and competition experiments demonstrated that the apl-type repeat is a true uss distinct from the hin-type uss: a. pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up dna fragments containing the apl-type uss over both h. influenzae and unrelated dnas, and h. influenzae prefers its own uss over the apl type. conclusion: competence and dna uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the pasteurellaceae, with divergent usss  and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. the conservation of most competence genes over the approximately 350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence may be evolutionary dead ends.

TI  == role of n-acetylglucosamine within core lipopolysaccharide of several species of  gram-negative bacteria in targeting the dc-sign (cd209).
AB  == our recent studies have shown that the dendritic cell-specific icam nonintegrin cd209 (dc-sign) specifically binds to the core lps of escherichia coli k12 (e. coli), promoting bacterial adherence and phagocytosis. in this current study, we  attempted to map the sites within the core lps that are directly involved in lps-dc-sign interaction. we took advantage of four sets of well-defined core lps  mutants, which are derived from e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus ducreyi and determined interaction of each of these four sets with dc-sign. our results demonstrated that n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) sugar residues within the core lps in these bacteria play an essential role in targeting the dc-sign receptor. our results also imply  that dc-sign is an innate immune receptor and the interaction of bacterial core lps and dc-sign may represent a primeval interaction between gram-negative bacteria and host phagocytic cells.

TI  == characterization of genetic and phenotypic diversity of invasive nontypeable haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == the ability of unencapsulated (nontypeable) haemophilus influenzae (nthi) to cause systemic disease in healthy children has been recognized only in the past decade. to determine the extent of similarity among invasive nontypeable isolates, we compared strain r2866 with 16 additional nthi isolates from blood and spinal fluid, 17 nasopharyngeal or throat isolates from healthy children, and 19 isolates from middle ear aspirates. the strains were evaluated for the presence of several genetic loci that affect bacterial surface structures and for biochemical reactions that are known to differ among h. influenzae strains. eight strains, including four blood isolates, shared several properties with r2866: they were biotype v (indole and ornithine decarboxylase positive, urease negative), contained sequence from the adhesin gene hia, and lacked a genetic island flanked by the infa and ksga genes. multilocus sequence typing showed that most biotype v isolates belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster as strain r2866. when present, the infa-ksga island contains lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic genes, either lic2b and lic2c or homologs of the losa and losb genes described for haemophilus ducreyi. the island was found in most nasopharyngeal and otitis isolates but was absent from 40% of invasive isolates. overall, the 33 hmw-negative isolates were much more likely than hmw-containing isolates to have  tryptophanase, ornithine decarboxylase, or lysine decarboxylase activity or to contain the hif genes. we conclude (i) that invasive isolates are genetically and phenotypically diverse and (ii) that certain genetic loci of nthi are frequently  found in association among nthi strains.

TI  == the family of serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

TI  == the cytolethal distending toxin of haemophilus ducreyi aggravates dermal lesions  in a rabbit model of chancroid.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, produces a cytolethal distending toxin (hdcdt) that inhibits cultured  cell proliferation, leading to cell death. a rabbit model of dermal infection was used to investigate the roles of h. ducreyi bacteria and hdcdt in the development, clinical appearance, and persistence of infection. a non-toxin producing h. ducreyi strain, and for comparison purposes a non-capsulated haemophilus influenzae strain, were inoculated intradermally, with and without co-administration of purified hdcdt. co-administration of hdcdt resulted in significant aggravation of h. ducreyi-induced inflammatory lesions, and development of ulcers in rabbit skin. less pronounced inflammatory lesions and lack of epithelial eruption were observed after inoculation with h. influenzae. histopathological sections of the h. ducreyi-induced lesions, in both the presence and absence of hdcdt, showed dense infiltrates of the same type inflammatory cells, with the exception of a prominent endothelial cell proliferation noted in sections from lesions caused by h. ducreyi and toxin. signs of chronic inflammation with involvement of t cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and granuloma formation were observed after h. ducreyi inoculation both with and without toxin. in conclusion, h. ducreyi causes a pronounced, chronic inflammation with involvement of t cells and macrophages, and in combination with hdcdt production of ulcers in the rabbit model. these pathogenic mechanisms may promote the development and persistence of chancroid ulcers.

AB  == a genomic island was identified in the haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius  brazilian purpuric fever (bpf) strain f3031. this island, which was also found in other bpf isolates, could not be detected in non-bpf biogroup aegyptius strains or in nontypeable or typeable h. influenzae strains, with the exception of a region present in the type b eagan strain. this 34,378-bp island is inserted, in  reference to h. influenzae rd kw20, within a choline transport gene and contains  a mosaic structure of mu-like prophage genes, several hypothetical genes, and genes potentially encoding an erwinia carotovora carotovoricin er-like bacteriocin. the product of the tail fiber orf in the bacteriocin-like region shows a hybrid structure where the c terminus is similar to an h. influenzae phage hp1 tail protein implicating this open reading frame in altering host specificity for a putative bacteriocin. significant synteny is seen in the entire genomic island with genomic regions from salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhi ct18, photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tt01, chromobacterium violaceum, and to a lesser extent haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp. in a previous work, we isolated several bpf-specific dna fragments through a genome  subtraction procedure, and we have found that a majority of these fragments map to this locus. in addition, several subtracted fragments generated from an independent laboratory by using different but related strains also map to this island. these findings underscore the importance of this bpf-specific chromosomal region in explaining some of the genomic differences between highly invasive bpf  strains and non-bpf isolates of biogroup aegyptius.

TI  == differential expression of porins ompp2a and ompp2b of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is a strict human pathogen and the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid. the genome of the human-passaged strain of h. ducreyi (35000hp) contains two homologous genes whose protein products have estimated molecular masses of 46 and 43 kda. a comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that these proteins share 27 to 33% identity to the outer membrane protein p2 (ompp2), a major porin of haemophilus influenzae. therefore, these proteins have been designated ompp2a and ompp2b, respectively. the detection of ompp2a and ompp2b transcripts by reverse transcriptase pcr indicated that these genes were independently transcribed in h. ducreyi 35000hp. western blot analysis of outer membrane proteins isolated from a geographically diverse collection of h. ducreyi clinical isolates revealed that ompp2a and ompp2b were differentially expressed among these strains. although pcr analysis suggested that ompp2a and ompp2b were conserved among the strains tested, the differential expression observed was due to nucleotide additions and  partial gene deletions. purified ompp2a and ompp2b were isolated under nondenaturing conditions, and subsequent analysis demonstrated that these two proteins exhibited porin activity. ompp2a and ompp2b are the first porins described for h. ducreyi.

TI  == interactions of haemophilus ducreyi and purified cytolethal distending toxin with human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, macrophages and cd4+ t cells.
AB  == to evaluate the early stages of the host response to chancroid bacterium haemophilus ducreyi, we investigated the in vitro responses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs) and macrophages (mqs) to this pathogen and haemophilus influenzae. the phagocytic activities and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion profiles of the antigen-presenting cells (apcs) were analyzed after exposure to gentamycin-killed bacteria, h. ducreyi lipooligosaccharide (los), and purified cytolethal distending toxin (hdcdt). t-cell proliferation and cytokine release were examined after co-culturing isolated autologous cd4+ t cells with antigen-pulsed apcs. both the dcs and mqs phagocytosed h. ducreyi and h. influenzae, as estimated by flow cytometry. all of the strains induced apc secretion of tnf-alpha, il-6, il-8, and il-12, as measured by elisa. other human  cells, particularly endothelial cells and fibroblasts, also produced cytokines when stimulated with these bacteria. purified los at concentration 1 microg/ml induced two to threefold lower levels of cytokines than the whole bacteria, which indicates that other components are involved in immune activation. hdcdt inhibited partially the production of the aforementioned cytokines. high levels of ifn-gamma, but not of il-4 and il-13, were secreted by t cells after activation by either dcs or mqs that were pre-exposed to bacteria, indicating the th1 nature of the immune response. the levels of t-cell proliferation induced by  h. ducreyi were lower than those induced by h. influenzae. hdcdt-treated apcs did not display cytokine responses or t-cell proliferation. these results indicate that hdcdt intoxication, which results in progressive apoptosis of apcs, may hamper early stage immune responses.

AB  == haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid, is highly resistant to the complement-mediated bactericidal activity of normal human serum (nhs). previously, we identified dsra (for ducreyi serum resistance a), a major factor required for expression of the serum resistance phenotype in h. ducreyi. we describe here a second outer membrane protein, dlta (for ducreyi lectin a), which also contributes to serum resistance in h. ducreyi. isogenic dlta mutants, constructed in 35000hp wild-type and fx517 dsra backgrounds, were more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of nhs than each respective parent, demonstrating the additive effect of the mutations. furthermore, expression of dlta in h. influenzae strain rd rendered this highly susceptible strain partially resistant to 5% nhs compared to a vector-control strain. although primary basic local alignment search tool analysis of the dlta open reading frame revealed no close bacterial homologue, similarity to the beta-chain of the eukaryotic lectin  ricin was noted. dlta shares highly conserved structural motifs with the ricin beta chain, such as cysteines and lectin-binding domains. to determine whether dlta was a lectin, ligand blots and affinity chromatography experiments were performed. dlta was affinity purified on immobilized lactose and n-acetylgalactosamine, and n-glycosylated but not glycosidase-treated model glycoproteins bound dlta. these data indicate that dlta is a lectin with specificity for lactose-related carbohydrates (cho) and is important for h. ducreyi serum resistance.

TI  == geneorder3.0: software for comparing the order of genes in pairs of small bacterial genomes.
AB  == background: an increasing number of whole viral and bacterial genomes are being sequenced and deposited in public databases. in parallel to the mounting interest in whole genomes, the number of whole genome analyses software tools is also increasing. geneorder was originally developed to provide an analysis of genes between two genomes, allowing visualization of gene order and synteny comparisons of any small genomes. it was originally developed for comparing virus, mitochondrion and chloroplast genomes. this is now extended to small bacterial genomes of sizes less than 2 mb. results: geneorder3.0 has been developed and validated successfully on several small bacterial genomes (ca. 580 kb to 1.83 mb) archived in the ncbi genbank database. it is an updated web-based "on-the-fly" computational tool allowing gene order and synteny comparisons of any two small bacterial genomes. analyses of several bacterial genomes show that a large amount of gene and genome re-arrangement occurs, as seen with earlier dna software tools. this can be displayed at the protein level using geneorder3.0. whole genome alignments of genes are presented in both a table and a dot plot. this allows the detection of evolutionary more distant relationships since protein sequences are more conserved than dna sequences. conclusions: geneorder3.0 allows researchers to perform comparative analysis of gene order and synteny in genomes  of sizes up to 2 mb "on-the-fly." availability: http://binf.gmu.edu/genometools.html and http://pasteur.atcc.org:8050/geneorder3.0.

TI  == haemophilus ducreyi strain atcc 27722 contains a genetic element with homology to the vibrio rs1 element that can replicate as a plasmid and confer nad independence on haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == proteome of haemophilus ducreyi by 2-d sds-page and mass spectrometry: strain variation, virulence, and carbohydrate expression.
AB  == we have analyzed the proteome of several strains of haemophilus ducreyi by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) and mass spectrometry. over 100 spots  were analyzed from the soluble and insoluble protein fractions from the prototype strain 35000hp and 122 distinct proteins were identified. functions of approximately 80% of the 122 proteins were deduced by identification with close homologues of haemophilus influenzae. four additional wild type and three mutant  strains were also analyzed that vary in their virulence and/or outer-membrane lipooligosaccharide structures. overall, the 2-de gel maps of the wild type and mutant strains were similar to strain 35000hp, suggesting little proteome diversity in relation to carbohydrate expression and/or virulence. an exception was the kenyan strain 33921 which contained significant differences in its proteome 2-de map and also synthesizes an unusual los with a trisaccharide branch structure. this african strain may represent a prototype of a second clonal group of h. ducreyi.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo interactions of haemophilus ducreyi with host phagocytes.
AB  == we investigated the phagocytosis of haemophilus ducreyi both in vitro and in vivo. human granulocyte and monocyte phagocytosis of opsonized and nonopsonized,  fluorescence-labeled h. ducreyi was assessed by flow cytometry. both escherichia  coli and noncapsulated h. influenzae were included as controls. the maximal percentage of granulocytes taken up by h. ducreyi was 35% after 90 min. in contrast, 95% of h. influenzae bacteria were phagocytosed by granulocytes after 30 min. these results indicated that h. ducreyi phagocytosis was slow and inefficient. bacterial opsonization by using specific antibodies increased the percentage of granulocytes phagocytosing h. ducreyi from 24 to 49%. the nonphagocytosed bacteria were completely resistant to phagocytosis even when reexposed to granulocytes, indicating that the h. ducreyi culture comprised a mixture of phenotypes. the intracellular survival of h. ducreyi in granulocytes,  in monocytes/macrophages, and in a monocyte cell line (thp-1) was quantified after application of gentamicin treatment to kill extracellular bacteria. h. ducreyi survival within phagocytes was poor; approximately 11 and <0.1% of the added bacteria survived intracellularly after 2 and 20 h of incubation, respectively, while no intracellular h. influenzae bacteria were recovered after  2 h of incubation with phagocytes. the role of phagocytes in the development of skin lesions due to h. ducreyi was also studied in vivo. mice that were depleted  of granulocytes and/or monocytes and scid mice, which lacked t and b cells, were  injected intradermally with approximately 10(6) cfu of h. ducreyi. within 4 days  of inoculation, the granulocyte-depleted mice developed lesions that persisted throughout the experimental period. this result reinforces the importance of granulocytes in the early innate defense against h. ducreyi infection. in conclusion, h. ducreyi is insufficiently phagocytosed to achieve complete eradication of the bacteria. indeed, h. ducreyi has the ability to survive intracellularly for short periods within phagocytic cells in vitro. since granulocytes play a major role in the innate defense against h. ducreyi infection in vivo, bacterial resistance to phagocytosis probably plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.

TI  == tricross : using dot-plots in sequence-id space to detect uncataloged intergenic  features.
AB  == motivation: the process of determining the functional sequence content of an organism is confounded by several factors. large protein coding sequences are relatively easy to find by statistical methods. smaller proteins however may escape detection due to their size falling below some arbitrary researcher-defined minimum cutoff, or the inability to precisely define a promoter, or translational start (delcher et al., nucleic acids res., 27, 4636-4641, 1999). promoter and regulatory sequences themselves are difficult to define due to a significant amount of allowable sequence variation, as well as a  probable lack of any completely accurate whole-organismal gene catalogs to date.  finally, certain genes coding functional rnas may have insufficient structural or sequence constraints to be detectable by normal sequence structure/pattern searching methods (eddy and rivas, bioinformatics, 16, 583-605, 2000). in those cases where there are multiple closely related organisms that have been sequenced, there is additional information that may be used in the investigation  of sequence content-that being the possible conserved nature of functional sequences between the organisms. we present a method for the utilization of this  conserved information to detect genes and other potentially functional sequences  that may be missed by standard orf-calling, rna finding, and pattern matching software. the tricross programs produce a multi-way cross comparison of three sets of sequences, determine which are conserved in all three sets, and produce a graphical (virtual reality modelling language-vrml; (iso/iec 14772-1: 1997, vdc), 1997) representation as well as alignments of all sequence triples found. the software can also be applied to a pair of sequence sets, though the noise in the  results increases. results: tricross has been used to examine the intergenic-sequence content of the three archaeal pyrococcus genomes to determine the most highly related sequences remaining between the annotated protein and rna coding sequences. set to relatively stringent similarity requirements for the search, tricross found 101 intergenic sequences conserved among the three organisms. interestingly, 29 of these appear to contain members of a family of small rna molecules (kiss-laszlo et al., embo j., 17, 797-807, 1998) only recently discovered in the archaea (armbruster, osu, diss., 1988; omer et al., science, 288, 517-522, 2000; gaspin et al., j. mol. biol., 297, 895-906, 2000). while some of the remaining 72 appear to be individual highly conserved promoter  sequences, others have no currently known biological significance. although originally developed to facilitate the examination of intergenic sequences, none  of the tricross logic is inherently specific to intergenic sequences. the software can also be applied to gene sequences, and has been used to produce inter-genomic gene order dot-plots for haemophilus influenzae (fleischmann et al., science, 269, 496-512, 1995) versus h.ducreyi (unpublished data), and neisseria meningiditis z2491 (serogroup a) (parkhill et al., nature, 404, 502-506, 2000) versus neisseria meningiditis z58 (serogroup b) (tettelin et al.,  science, 287, 1809-1815, 2000) versus neisseria gonorrhoeae (lewis et al., http://micro-gen.ouhsc.edu/, 2000). availability: the tricross software package is available from http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html. contact: ray@biosci.ohio-state.edu; daniels.7@osu.edu; munsonr@pediatrics.ohio-state.edu supplementary information: additional data from the cross-genomic comparisons examined in the discussion section are linked from http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~ray/bioinformatics/tricross.html.

TI  == genetic analysis of a pyocin-resistant lipooligosaccharide (los) mutant of haemophilus ducreyi: restoration of full-length los restores pyocin sensitivity.
AB  == dna sequence and southern blot analyses were used to determine the genetic defect of a haemophilus ducreyi pyocin-resistant lipooligosaccharide (los) mutant, hd35000r. the region of the hd35000r chromosome containing the suspected mutation was amplified, and sequence analysis detected a 3,189-bp deletion. this deletion  resulted in the loss of the entire waaq gene, another open reading frame that encodes a putative homolog to a hypothetical protein (hi0461) of h. influenzae, the gene encoding an argininosuccinate synthase homolog, and a change in the 3' sequence of the lgtf gene. southern blot analysis confirmed that no genomic rearrangements had occurred. isogenic los mutants and the respective complemented mutants were evaluated for susceptibility to pyocin c. the mutants expressing truncated los were resistant to lysis by pyocin c, and complementation restored sensitivity to the pyocin. we conclude that hd35000r is defective in both glycosyltransferase genes and that pyocin resistance is due to truncation of the  full-length los molecule.

TI  == cloning, overexpression, purification, and immunobiology of an 85-kilodalton outer membrane protein from haemophilus ducreyi.

TI  == a histidine-rich metal binding domain at the n terminus of cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria: a novel strategy for metal chaperoning.
AB  == a group of cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from pathogenic bacteria is characterized  by histidine-rich n-terminal extensions that are in a highly exposed and mobile conformation. this feature allows these proteins to be readily purified in a single step by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. the cu,zn-superoxide dismutases from both haemophilus ducreyi and haemophilus parainfluenzae display anomalous absorption spectra in the visible region due to copper binding at the n-terminal region. reconstitution experiments of copper-free enzymes demonstrate  that, under conditions of limited copper availability, this metal ion is initially bound at the n-terminal region and subsequently transferred to an active site. evidence is provided for intermolecular pathways of copper transfer  from the n-terminal domain of an enzyme subunit to an active site located on a distinct dimeric molecule. incubation with edta rapidly removes copper bound at the n terminus but is much less effective on the copper ion bound at the active site. this indicates that metal binding by the n-terminal histidines is kinetically favored, but the catalytic site binds copper with higher affinity. we suggest that the histidine-rich n-terminal region constitutes a metal binding domain involved in metal uptake under conditions of metal starvation in vivo. particular biological importance for this domain is inferred by the observation that its presence enhances the protection offered by periplasmic cu,zn-superoxide dismutase toward phagocytic killing.

TI  == identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from haemophilus ducreyi which confers nad independence.
AB  == members of the family pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an nad supplement for growth on laboratory media. in this study, we  demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadv, whose presence allows nad-independent growth of haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. this gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for nad independence in haemophilus ducreyi. when transformed into a. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed nad-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of nad on defined media. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular  mass of 55,619 da. compared with the sequence databases, nadv was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-b-cell colony-enhancing factor pbef and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, shewanella putrefaciens, synechocystis sp., deinococcus radiodurans, pasteurella multocida, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. p. multocida and a. actinomycetemcomitans are among the nad-independent members of the pasteurellaceae. homologues of nadv  were not found in the sequenced genome of h. influenzae, an nad-dependent member  of the pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of nad, such as escherichia coli. sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. identification of a function for this gene in the pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.

TI  == expression of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein is required for virulence in the human model of haemophilus ducreyi infection.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi expresses a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (pal) that exhibits extensive homology to haemophilus influenzae protein 6. we constructed an isogenic pal mutant (35000hp-sms4) by the use of a suicide vector that contains lacz as a counterselectable marker. h. ducreyi 35000hp-sms4 and its parent, 35000hp, had similar growth rates in broth and similar lipooligosaccharide profiles. 35000hp-sms4 formed smaller, more transparent colonies than 35000hp and, unlike its parent, was hypersensitive to antibiotics.  complementation of the mutant in trans restored the parental phenotypes. to test  whether expression of pal is required for virulence, nine human volunteers were experimentally infected. each subject was inoculated with two doses (41 to 89 cfu) of live 35000hp and one dose of heat-killed bacteria on one arm and with three doses (ranging from 28 to 800 cfu) of live 35000hp-sms4 on the other arm. papules developed at similar rates at sites inoculated with the mutant or parent  but were significantly smaller at mutant-inoculated sites than at parent-inoculated sites. the pustule formation rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [ci], 46.5 to 90.3%) at 18 parent sites and 11% (95% ci, 2.4 to 29.2%) at 27 mutant sites (p < 0.0001). the rates of recovery of h. ducreyi from surface cultures were 8% (n = 130; 95% ci, 4.3 to 14.6%) for parent-inoculated sites and  0% (n = 120; 95% ci, 0.0 to 2.5%) for mutant-inoculated sites (p < 0.001). h. ducreyi was recovered from six of seven biopsied parent-inoculated sites and from one of three biopsied mutant-inoculated sites. confocal microscopy confirmed that the bacteria present in a mutant inoculation site pustule lacked a pal-specific epitope. although biosafety regulations precluded our testing the complemented mutant in humans, these results suggest that expression of pal facilitates the ability of h. ducreyi to progress to the pustular stage of disease.

TI  == characterization and expression of hmur, a tonb-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the gram-negative pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that p. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. however, the specific mechanisms utilized  by p. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. in this study we have determined that a newly identified tonb-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (hmur) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in p. gingivalis a7436. hmur shares amino acid homology with tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including hemr of  yersinia enterocolitica, shua of shigella dysenteriae, hpub of neisseria gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis, hmbr of n. meningitidis, hgba of haemophilus ducreyi, and hgpb of h. influenzae. southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmur gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmur in p. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, w50, and 53977. we also identified directly  upstream of the hmur gene a gene which we designated hmuy. upstream of the hmuy start codon, a region with homology to the fur binding consensus sequence was identified. reverse transcription-pcr analysis revealed that hmur and hmuy were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. inactivation of hmur resulted in a decreased ability of p. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant hmur were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. furthermore, purified recombinant hmur was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. taken together, these results indicate that hmur serves as the major tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin  in p. gingivalis.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the lipooligosaccharide galactosyltransferase ii  gene of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease. the lipooligosaccharide (los) is considered to be a major virulence determinant and has been implicated in the adherence of h. ducreyi to keratinocytes. strain a77, an isolate from the paris collection, is serum sensitive, poorly adherent to fibroblasts, and deficient in microcolony formation. structural analysis indicates that the los of strain a77 lacks the galactose residue found in the n-acetyllactosamine portion of the strain 35000hp los as well as the sialic acid  substitution. from an h. ducreyi 35000hp genomic dna library, a clone complementing the defect in a77 was identified by immunologic screening with monoclonal antibody (mab) 3f11, a mab which recognizes the n-acetyllactosamine portion of strain 35000hp los. the clone contained a 4-kb insert that was sequenced. one open reading frame which encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 33,400 was identified. this protein has homology to glycosyltransferases of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus somnus, neisseria species, and pasteurella haemolytica. the putative h. ducreyi glycosyltransferase gene was insertionally inactivated, and an isogenic mutant of strain 35000hp was constructed. the most complex los glycoform produced by the mutant has a mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel identical to that of the los of strain a77 and lacks the 3f11-binding epitope. structural studies confirm that the most complex glycoform of the los isolated from the mutant lacks the galactose residue found in the n-acetyllactosamine portion of the strain 35000hp los. although previously published data suggested that the serum-sensitive phenotype of a77 was due to the los mutation, we observed that the complemented a77 strain retained its serum-sensitive phenotype and that the galactosyltransferase mutant retained its  serum-resistant phenotype. thus, the serum sensitivity of strain a77 cannot be attributed to the galactosyltransferase mutation in strain a77.

TI  == identification of the znua-encoded periplasmic zinc transport protein of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == the znua gene of haemophilus ducreyi encodes a 32-kda (mature) protein that has homology to both the znua protein of escherichia coli and the pzp1 protein of h.  influenzae; both of these latter proteins are members of a growing family of prokaryotic zinc transporters. inactivation of the h. ducreyi 35000 znua gene by  insertional mutagenesis resulted in a mutant that grew more slowly than the wild-type parent strain in vitro unless zncl(2) was provided at a final concentration of 100 microm. other cations tested did not restore growth of this  h. ducreyi mutant to wild-type levels. the h. ducreyi znua protein was localized  to the periplasm, where it is believed to function as the binding component of a  zinc transport system. complementation of the znua mutation with the wild-type h. ducreyi znua gene provided in trans restored the ability of this h. ducreyi mutant to grow normally in the absence of exogenously added zncl2. the wild-type  h. ducreyi znua gene was also able to complement a h. influenzae pzp1 mutation. the h. ducreyi znua isogenic mutant exhibited significantly decreased virulence (p = 0.0001) when tested in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid. this decreased virulence was not observed when the znua mutant was complemented with the wild-type h. ducreyi znua gene provided in trans.

TI  == involvement of the haemophilus ducreyi gmha gene product in lipooligosaccharide expression and virulence.
AB  == the lipooligosaccharide (los) present in the outer membrane of haemophilus ducreyi is likely a virulence factor for this sexually transmitted pathogen. an open reading frame in h. ducreyi 35000 was found to encode a predicted protein that had 87% identity with the protein product of the gmha (isn) gene of haemophilus influenzae. in h. influenzae type b, inactivation of the gmha gene caused the synthesis of a significantly truncated los which possessed only lipid  a and a single 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid molecule (a. preston, d. j. maskell, a. johnson, and e. r. moxon, j. bacteriol. 178:396-402, 1996). the h. ducreyi gmha gene was able to complement a gmha-deficient escherichia coli strain, a result which confirmed the identity of this gene. when the gmha gene of h. ducreyi was inactivated by insertion of a cat cartridge, the resultant h. ducreyi gmha mutant, 35000.252, expressed a los that migrated much faster than wild-type los in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. when  the wild-type h. ducreyi strain and its isogenic gmha mutant were used in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for dermal lesion production by h. ducreyi, the gmha mutant was found to be substantially less virulent than the wild-type parent strain. the h. ducreyi gmha gene was amplified by pcr from the h. ducreyi  chromosome and cloned into the pls88 vector. when the h. ducreyi gmha gene was present in trans in gmha mutant 35000.252, expression of the gmha gene product restored the virulence of this mutant to wild-type levels. these results indicate that the gmha gene product of h. ducreyi is essential for the expression of wild-type los by this pathogen.

TI  == cloning and characterization of tdha, a locus encoding a tonb-dependent heme receptor from haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is unable to synthesize heme and must acquire it from its only known host, humans. we cloned and sequenced a gene encoding an outer membrane receptor for heme. it was designated tdha (for tonb-dependent heme receptor a) since it was related by sequence homology to the family of tonb-dependent receptors. tdha was strikingly similar to open reading frame hi0113 from the genome of haemophilus influenzae rd and also shared homology with five other heme receptors, including hxuc, hemr, hmur, chua, and shua, from gram-negative bacteria. an escherichia coli hema tonb mutant strongly expressing  h. ducreyi tdha grew on low levels of heme as a source of heme only when an intact h. ducreyi ton system plasmid was present, formally demonstrating functional tonb dependence. tdha was expressed poorly in vitro by h. ducreyi and  only under conditions of heme limitation. a survey of h. ducreyi revealed that all tested strains but one synthesized small amounts of tdha in vitro under heme-limiting conditions. surprisingly, an isogenic mutant of tdha as well as its parent, 35000, both required the same high levels of heme for growth (50 microgram/ml [77 microm] on agar medium). this result, together with previous findings, suggests that in vitro, the uptake of heme by h. ducreyi is mediated by a tonb- and tdha-independent mechanism, possibly diffusion.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of serum is an important primary host defence against gram-negative bacteria. little is known regarding such antibodies that are specific to outer membrane (om) antigens as pili and lipooligosaccharides (los) in the bactericidal killing of haemophilus ducreyi. presence of serum antibodies  with specificity to a 430 kda protein (polymer of the 24 kda protein, named fine-tangled pili) and los in serum from chancroid patients and healthy individuals were investigated by elisa. using a bactericidal assay, we investigated the role of human and rabbit antibodies with the aforementioned specificity. accessibility of los and of om antigens, as well as the deposition of components of the complement (c) system on the surface of the bacteria, was further investigated by whole-cell elisa and immunoelectron microscopy. immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies specific to the 430 kda polymer and to los were demonstrated in the majority of sera from chancroid patients and healthy individuals. however, sera from chancroid patients did not significantly enhance  the c-mediated killing of h. ducreyi compared with normal human serum (nhs). similar results were demonstrated using rabbit sera to whole bacteria, specific to the 430 kda protein and los of h. ducreyi. however, using the same assay noncapsulatedh. influenzae was totally killed, as were h. influenzae type b in presence of specific antibodies. this suggests a limited effectiveness of antibodies specific to surface antigens in c-mediated killing of h. ducreyi. los  was detectable on the surface of h. ducreyi with a specific monoclonal antibody in white-cell elisa. however, a significant enhancement of los detection was demonstrated on washed bacteria. om antigens of 26, 40, 45 kda and the major outer membrane protein (momp) of 43 kda were not detectable on the surface of nonwashed and washed bacteria by specific monoclonal antibodies, indicating a lack of accessibility of these antigens on the bacterial surface. however, the c6 to c9 components of c were detected on the bacterial surface, suggesting capacity of forming the membrane attack complex. altogether, these findings imply that antibodies specific to surface antigens, such as the 430 kda protein and los, are not capable of enhancing killing of bacteria. the demonstrated relative resistance is probably due not to a lack of deposition of the membrane attack complex components, but rather to a blocking of los accessibility and om proteins as potential targets of bactericidal antibodies and c action.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a 16s/23s ribosomal spacer from haemophilus parainfluenzae reveals an invariant, mosaic-like organisation of sequence blocks.
AB  == a 16s/23s ribosomal spacer from a haemophilus parainfluenzae rrn locus was cloned and sequenced. analysis of pcr-amplified genomic fragments showed that this region is strongly conserved among unrelated isolates; computer analysis of database homologies showed that the spacer consists of sequence blocks, arranged  in a mosaic-like structure, with strong homologies with analogous blocks present  in the spacer regions of haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus ducreyi and actinobacillus spp. it also contains a trna(glu) gene, which is highly homologous to trna(glu) genes found in spacers of other species. these data strongly support the hypothesis that recombination events are involved in the organisation of the  sequence of the spacer, as a result of horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == characterization of mechanisms involved in adherence of haemophilus ducreyi to eukaryotic cells.
AB  == the adherence of haemophilus ducreyi to eukaryotic cells of various origins was investigated by means of a microassay using radiolabelled bacteria. the influence of physicochemical conditions and of different inhibitors on adherence to hep-2 cells and human fibroblasts was examined. h. ducreyi strains manifested substantial adherence capacity (range, 11-38% of inoculum) to different cells, not discriminating between human and animal origin. the level of adherence was temperature-dependent, being substantially decreased by incubation at 4 degrees c, but was unaffected in the ph range 4-10. the adherence level was significantly reduced in the presence of sodium chloride or tetramethylurea (a hydrophobic bond-breaking agent). in addition, h. ducreyi bacteria manifested a pronounced capacity for binding congo red to the surface, in comparison with the low binding ability of h. influenzae type b. this further indicates hydrophobic domains to be accessible on the surface of h. ducreyi. inhibition studies with bacterial edta extract, sialic acid, heparin and heparan sulphate resulted in a significant reduction in adherent bacteria. however, adherence was not inhibited with crude 24 kda pili material, los of h. ducreyi or fibronectin. neither crude nor purified 24 kda protein of h. ducreyi bacteria showed any capacity to bind monolayers of hep-2, hela or human fibroblasts cells, as tested by immunoblot using specific polyclonal antibodies. the overall results suggest that adherence  of h. ducreyi to eukaryotic cells is not specific to a particular cell type, human or animal. adherence to hep-2 cells involves a multiplicity of factors such as ionic and hydrophobic forces, and can be mediated by tissue heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans. however, specific binding to hep-2 cells does not seem to  be mediated by the 24 kda pili protein of h. ducreyi.

TI  == the soda gene of haemophilus ducreyi encodes a hydrogen peroxide-inhibitable superoxide dismutase.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, an ulcerative condition implicated in increased hiv transmission. there is increasing evidence for the roles of oxidative stress proteins including superoxide dismutase enzymes in the survival and persistence of pathogenic organisms within the host. the soda gene of haemophilus ducreyi was isolated from a genomic plasmid library on the basis of its ability to rescue the hydrogen peroxide hypersensitivity of an escherichia coli soda sodb strain. the h. ducreyi soda protein also complemented the aerobic growth defect of the e. coli soda sodb strain in minimal medium. the deduced amino-acid sequence of the h. ducreyi soda  gene product is 74 and 70% identical to the mn-sods of haemophilus influenzae and e. coli, respectively. however, unlike mn-sods, the h ducreyi soda protein was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide in native gels stained for sod activity.

TI  == structurally defined epitopes of haemophilus ducreyi lipooligosaccharides recognized by monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting techniques, the migration patterns and binding epitopes of lipooligosaccharides (los) from 10 haemophilus ducreyi strains were investigated with two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), mahd6 and mahd7, raised against los from h. ducreyi itm 2665. closely related los, with defined structures, from haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, aeromonas spp., and synthetic glycoproteins were also included in the  analyses. the mabs bound to conserved epitopes of los exposed on the surface of h. ducreyi. the mab mahd6 reacted with 8 of the 10 los from h. ducreyi but with none of the other haemophilus or bordetella spp. with structurally defined los. it is suggested that mab mahd6 binds to a los epitope (-dd-hepp-1-->6-beta-d-glcp-). this los epitope is not present in the hexasaccharide structure of los from h. ducreyi itm 4747 (e. k. h. schweda, a. c. sundstrom, l. m. eriksson, j. a. jonasson, and a. a. lindberg, j. biol. chem. 269:12040-12048, 1994). because mab mahd6 reacts with the epitope mentioned above, it also discriminates between the two los structures, the hexasaccharide group and the nonasaccharide group, of h. ducreyi strains. mab mahd7 recognizes the common conserved inner core region of the los because it reacts with all h. ducreyi strains and with los with minor components in the inner core epitope structure. rabbit polyclonal sera raised against the los from strains ccug 4438 and ccug 7470 were tested with the 10 los from the h. ducreyi strains. the antiserum to ccug 7470 reacted with all h. ducreyi strains as did mab mahd7, whereas the antiserum to ccug 4438 reacted with only its homologous strain and strain itm 4747. also, the loss of our reference strains ccug 4438 and ccug 7470  were structurally analyzed by use of sugar analyses and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. the hexasaccharide and nonasaccharide structures obtained from los of strains ccug 4438 and ccug 7470 were identical to the described los structures from h. ducreyi itm 4747 and itm 2665, respectively. in  conclusion, the mab mahd6 recognizes an epitope present in the nonasaccharide los group, whereas the mab mahd7 recognizes a conserved epitope on los of h. ducreyi, which is present in all strains of h. ducreyi tested. two major groups of oligosaccharides were distinguished by their los structures and the reactivity of monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies. the majority of h. ducreyi strains possess a nonasaccharide structure of los.

AB  == a recombinant plasmid (pmg1) carrying pasteurella haemolytica a1 dna which complements a tonb mutation of escherichia coli has been isolated. e. coli tonb mete which carries pmg1 exhibits growth kinetics in the presence of vitamin b12 similar to that of the wild-type host. in addition, the complemented e. coli is susceptible to killing by bacteriophage phi 80 and colicin b. analysis of the nucleotide sequence in the complementing dna showed that it codes for three genes in the order of exbb-exbd-tonb. this genetic organization has been reported in haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, pseudomonas putida and vibrio cholerae, and may represent a separate lineage of evolution from that of the enterobacteriaceae in which tonb is unlinked with the accessory genes exbb and exbd. a comparison of the dna flanking the exbb-exbd-tonb locus in p. haemolytica a1 and h. influenzae  showed that the flanking regions are completely different between the two organisms.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies against haemophilus influenzae lipopolysaccharides: clone mahi 4 binding to a pentasaccharide containing terminal beta-gal residues and clone mahi 10 recognizing terminal phosphorylated saccharide residues.
AB  == mouse monoclonal antibodies mahi 4 and mahi 10 reactive with haemophilus influenzae lipopolysaccharide (lps), were generated by fusing mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with h. influenzae strain rm.7004-xp-1. the antibody mahi 4 reacted in whole-cell enzyme immunoassay (eia) and colony-dot-immunoblotting with 20 of 123 h. influenzae strains and to a few other human haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., but not to any bordetella pertussis, b. parapertussis, aeromonas spp. or moraxella catarrhalis strains tested. this suggests a specific epitope accessible to recognition in just a few strains. this conclusion was supported by the data on binding of mahi 4 to only three of 18 h.  influenzae lpss tested, but not to any haemophilus ducreyi or enterobacterial lpss. the antibody mahi 10 bound to 80 of 123 strains of h. influenzae and to a few strains of neisseria spp. and m. catarrhalis as evaluated by eia and colony-dot-immunoblotting, which suggests an epitope accessible to recognition in 65% of the h. influenzae strains tested. the antibody mahi 10 reacted with 10 of  18 h. influenzae lpss as determined by eia. by using polysaccharides, obtained after both mild acidic hydrolysis, strong alkali treatment, and dephosphorylation, as inhibitors of the antibodies binding to h. influenzae lps antigens it was shown that phosphate groups were essential for the binding of mahi 10 to lps but they did not affect antigenic recognition by mahi 4. none of the monoclonal antibodies bound to isolated lipid a, but the aggregation caused by the fatty acids of lipid a was essential for optimum epitope recognition. enzymatic treatment of homologous lpss with galactose-oxidase led to products which were between 20 to 30 times less effective as inhibitors of the binding of  the mahi 4 than the native lpss. taken together the results indicate that mahi 4  has the following pentasaccharide as the epitope gal beta 1-->2 hep alpha 1-->2hep alpha 1-->3hep alpha 1--> kdo(p). these results emphasize the importance of the terminal beta-gal residue in the definition of the mahi 4 specificity, and of the terminal phosphorylated saccharide residues of some of the haemophilus lpss for the mahi 10 specificity.

TI  == identification of an outer membrane protein involved in utilization of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes by nontypeable haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == a recombinant plasmid containing a 6.5-kb fragment of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) chromosomal dna was shown to confer a hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding phenotype on escherichia coli. use of a mini-tn10kan transposon for random insertion mutagenesis of this recombinant plasmid allowed localization of the nthi dna responsible for this hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding phenotype to a 3.5-kb psti-xhoi fragment within the 6.5-kb nthi dna insert. when this mutagenized nthi dna fragment was used to transform the wild-type nthi strain, the resultant kanamycin-resistant mutant exhibited significantly decreased abilities to bind hemoglobin-haptoglobin and utilize it as a source of heme for aerobic growth in vitro. this mutant also lacked expression of a 115-kda outer membrane protein that was present in the wild-type parent strain. transformation of this mutant with wild-type nthi chromosomal dna restored the abilities to bind and utilize hemoglobin-haptoglobin and to express the 115-kda outer membrane protein. nucleotide sequence analysis of the relevant nthi dna revealed the presence of a gene, designated hhua, that encoded a predicted 117,145-da protein. the hhua protein exhibited features typical of a tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor and had significant identity  with the hemoglobin receptors of both haemophilus ducreyi and neisseria meningitidis.

TI  == cloning of a dna fragment encoding a heme-repressible hemoglobin-binding outer membrane protein from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae is able to use hemoglobin as a sole source of heme, and heme-repressible hemoglobin binding to the cell surface has been demonstrated. using an affinity purification methodology, a hemoglobin-binding protein of approximately 120 kda was isolated from h. influenzae type b strain hi689 grown in heme-restricted but not in heme-replete conditions. the isolated protein was subjected to n-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the derived amino acid sequence was used to design corresponding oligonucleotides. the oligonucleotides  were used to probe a southern blot of ecori-digested hi689 genomic dna. a hybridizing band of approximately 4.2 kb was successfully cloned into puc19. using a 1.9-kb internal bglii fragment of the 4.2-kb clone as a probe, hybridization was seen in both typeable and nontypeable h. influenzae but not in  other bacterial species tested. following partial nucleotide sequencing of the 4.2-kb insert, a putative open reading frame was subcloned into an expression vector. the host escherichia coli strain in which the cloned fragment was expressed bound biotinylated human hemoglobin, whereas binding of hemoglobin was  not detected in e. coli with the vector alone. in conclusion, we hypothesize that the dna fragment encoding an approximately 120-kda heme-repressible hemoglobin-binding protein mediates one step in the acquisition of hemoglobin by  h. influenzae in vivo.

TI  == the conserved 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein of haemophilus ducreyi has homology to pal.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi expresses an 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein that contains a conserved surface-exposed epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 3b9. monoclonal antibody 3b9 cross-reacts with proteins of similar molecular weight found in many haemophilus sp. strains, including p6, a candidate vaccine for haemophilus influenzae. the gene encoding the 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein was identified by screening a lambdagt11 genomic library with 3b9. the coding sequence of the gene was localized to a 471-bp open reading  frame, designated pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein). translation of pal  predicted a mature polypeptide with a molecular weight of 15,000 that had extensive homology with p6 and escherichia coli pal. the predicted signal peptide had features characteristic of a prokaryotic lipoprotein, and processing of pal was sensitive to globomycin in h. ducreyi. the sequences encoding mature h. ducreyi pal were subcloned into the vector prset b and expressed as a polyhistidine-containing fusion protein that bound 3b9. in western blot (immunoblot) analysis, serum samples obtained from healthy subjects and patients  with chancroid or other genital ulcer diseases contained antibodies to purified pal. antibodies that bound to pal were removed by absorption with a lysate of haemophilus sp. antigens, suggesting that patients with chancroid do not develop  an h. ducreyi-specific antibody response to pal.

(1992) j.  biol. chem. 267, 13434-13439) with the missing anomeric configurations. the saccharide isolated from strain 4747 is a markedly simpler hexasaccharide with the following structure: beta-d-galp-1-->4-beta-d-glcp-1-->(l-alpha-d-hepp-1-->2-l-alpha-d- hepp- 1-->3)4-l-alpha-d-hepp-kdo. apart from a different phosphorylation of the inner core region the proposed structure is identical to the structure of lipopolysaccharide from an only distantly related bacterium, viz. haemophilus influenzae nontypable strain 2019 (phillips, n. j., apicella, m. a., griffiss, j. m., and gibson, b.w.

AB  == heterogeneity in the lipooligosaccharides (los) of pathogenic haemophilus and neisseria species is evident from the multiplicity of components observed with electrophoretic analyses. knowledge of the precise structures that make up these  diverse los molecules is clearly the key to reaching an understanding of pathogenic processes such as phase variation and molecular mimicry. except for a  few cases, little is known about the specific structural features of los that underlie phase variation and molecular mimicry, partly because of the inherent difficulties in the structural elucidation of these complex glycolipids. in the lipopolysaccharides (lps) from salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, rough, or r-type, mutants have been isolated that have provided insight into the  biosynthetic pathways and associated genetics that control lps expression. nonetheless, recent work has shown that these r-type lps are more complex than originally thought, and significant heterogeneity is still observed, primarily in their phosphorylation states. in order to investigate the structures of lps and los in a more rapid fashion, we have determined the precise molecular weights of  los (and lps) preparations from various haemophilus, neisseria, and salmonella species by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. the los (or lps) were first o-deacylated under mild hydrazine conditions to remove o-linked esters primarily  from the lipid a portion. under negative-ion conditions, the o-deacylated los yield abundant multiply deprotonated molecular ions, (m-nh)n-, where n refers to  the number of protons removed and therefore determines the absolute charge state, n = z. mass spectra from different los and lps preparations have provided detailed information concerning the structural basis for los (and lps) heterogeneity and corresponding saccharide compositions. the identification of sialic acid in the los of haemophilus and neisseria species and the variable phosphorylation of the core of s. typhimurium lps have afforded insights into the biosynthetic pathways used by these organisms. information of this type is important for understanding the underlying genetic and environmental factors controlling los and lps expression.

AB  == haemophilus ducreyi contains a major outer membrane protein (momp) whose apparent molecular weight is 39,000 to 42,000 for all strains tested. two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated 9d12 and 2c7, bound to the momp for all strains of  h. ducreyi tested. as reported previously, mab 9d12 was h. ducreyi specific (e. j. hansen and t. a. loftus, infect. immun. 44:196-198, 1984). mab 2c7 bound to all members of the family pasteurellaceae tested, suggesting that the mabs bound  to distinct epitopes on the momp. the momp was purified by extraction of whole cells with zwittergent and ion-exchange chromatography. a peak eluted from a cation-exchange column contained three bands. all three species bound both mabs,  and the fraction yielded a single n-terminal amino acid sequence, suggesting that the bands represented different conformations of the momp. the momp was heat modifiable, contained two cysteine residues, and was cationic at ph 8.0, features not usually associated with classical porin proteins. the n-terminal amino acid sequence and total amino acid content of the momp were homologous to the ompa proteins of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and the ompa-like protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. an ompa-specific polyclonal serum bound to  the momp, and mab 2c7 bound to haemophilus influenzae protein 5, an ompa-like protein, indicating that the momp was antigenically related to ompa. these data indicated that the most abundant protein in the outer membrane of h. ducreyi was  not a classical porin and belonged to the ompa family of proteins.

AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == identification of highly conserved and species-specific polypeptides of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == chancroid is a sexually transmitted diseased caused by haemophilus ducreyi. the pathological manifestations of chancroid are unique among haemophilus species and the virulence factors of h. ducreyi that account for these features have not been identified. some of these virulence factors may be unique components of h. ducreyi, but attempts to identify h. ducreyi-specific components have been unsuccessful. four polypeptides--a, b, c and d of 83, 77, 56 and 28 kda, respectively--were identified with a panel of nine h. ducreyi-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). polypeptide c was one of the five major proteins in h. ducreyi and demonstrated micro-heterogeneity in sds-page. polypeptides a, b and d were present in only small amounts in whole-cell lysates of h. ducreyi. the relative amounts of a and b varied, suggesting that they may be precursor molecules. the unique polypeptides c and d were not exposed on the surface. polypeptide c was highly soluble and did not appear to be membrane-bound, whereas polypeptide d appeared to partition with the cytoplasmic membrane and was soluble in sarkosyl.  all four polypeptides appeared to be unique to h. ducreyi since mabs directed against them did not cross-react with h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae or neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mol. wts of all of these polypeptides were conserved throughout 35 clinical isolates collected from 15 cities in eight countries and one reference strain of h. ducreyi that were tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == use of an adsorption enzyme immunoassay to evaluate the haemophilus ducreyi specific and cross-reactive humoral immune response of humans.
AB  == serodiagnosis of chancroid is limited by the cross-reactivity of haemophilus ducreyi with haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. this research describes an adsorption enzyme immunoassay (eia) that assesses the humoral immune response of north americans and africans to h. ducreyi. adsorption effectively removed anti-h. influenzae and anti-h. parainfluenzae antibodies, revealing that  north american control sera had no residual anti-h. ducreyi reactivity. however,  african control sera still had a residual anti-h. ducreyi response. assessment of the duration of the humoral immune response in sera from african patients with chancroid showed that the humoral antibodies persisted for up to 8 months after the diagnosis. this may explain the lack of specificity of the adsorption eia in  areas where chancroid is endemic. the detection of the humoral immune response was affected by the strain of h. ducreyi used, with indigent strains being most useful. using h. ducreyi 35000 for canadian sera, the sensitivity of the adsorption eia was 100% and the specificity was 88%. for african sera, h. ducreyi strain r018 was used, and the adsorption eia had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of only 23%. these data reveal that the existing humoral response in  a country where chancroid is endemic differs from that in a country where it is not, and that care must be used interpreting unadsorbed humoral immune responses. the adsorption eia approach may prove useful as an epidemiologic tool for definition of existing (past and present) levels of exposure to h. ducreyi.

TI  == partial characterization of the major lipooligosaccharide from a strain of haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease.
AB  == the first preliminary structure of a surface lipooligosaccharide from haemophilus ducreyi has been determined. the major oligosaccharide was released by mild acid  hydrolysis and analyzed by liquid secondary ion and tandem mass spectrometry. the mass spectral data combined with composition and methylation analysis yielded the most probable structure; gal1----4glcnac1----3gal1----4hep1----6glc1----( hep1----2hep1----)3,4hep1---- kdo, where the reducing terminal 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (or kdo) exists in an anhydro form. this anhydro species results from the elimination of a phosphate from c-4 of kdo during mild acid hydrolysis. the core heptose trisaccharide consists of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose, but analysis of the peracetylated sugars indicated that the 1,4-linked heptose is likely d-glycero-d-manno-heptose. the monoclonal antibody 3f11 generated against neisseria gonorrhoeae also binds to this lipooligosaccharide and suggests that the terminal trisaccharide is gal beta 1----4glcnac beta 1----3gal beta 1----, an epitope found in the glycose moiety of the human erythrocyte glycosphingolipid lactoneotetraglycosylceramide. mass spectrometric and composition analysis of the lipid a moiety shows that it is similar to the lipid a of haemophilus influenzae strain i-69 rd-/b+ proposed by helander et al. (helander, i. m., lindner, b., brade, h., altmann, k., lindberg,  a. a., rietschel, e. t., and zahringer, u. (1988) eur. j. biochem. 177, 483-492). electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the intact o-deacylated lipooligosaccharides gave an average mr of 2710, and supported an overall structure consisting of the above nonasaccharide linked directly to a diphosphorylated lipid a moiety through the single kdo which is phosphorylated. this structure should provide a framework to investigate the roles of lipooligosaccharides in the host immunochemical response and pathology of h. ducreyi infection, a leading cause of genital ulcer disease.

TI  == cytopathic effect of haemophilus ducreyi for human foreskin cell culture.
AB  == an explant adult foreskin cell culture (fs2-3) was compared with human lung carcinoma cell culture (a549) with regard to the ability of haemophilus ducreyi to produce a cytopathic effect. the survival of h. ducreyi for up to 26 days in fs2-3 cells was far greater than in any previously described in-vitro culture system. h. ducreyi survived for up to 7 days in a549 cells. the h. ducreyi cells  grew and formed "fungal-like" microcolonies on the eukaryotic monolayer. portions of the microcolonies remained attached despite extensive washing. transmission electronmicroscopy indicated that, at 48 h after infection, the h. ducreyi cells  did not penetrate the fs2-3 cells but they were closely associated with them; there was only a 2-5 nm gap between the h. ducreyi cell wall and the fs2-3 membrane. the virulent h. ducreyi strains ro18 and 35,000 produced a cytopathic effect on fs2-3 cells that did not appear to be due to a soluble toxin. these strains did not produce any cpe on a549 cells. h. influenzae and the avirulent h. ducreyi strain cip542, inoculated in the same concentration and incubated for the same length of time, did not produce cpe on fs2-3 cells. this study demonstrated  that the use of fs2-3 foreskin cell culture provided an in-vitro approach for evaluating the cytopathic effect of virulent h. ducreyi whereby, unlike in other  in-vitro systems, viability of the micro-organism could be readily maintained.

TI  == lipooligosaccharides (los) of some haemophilus species mimic human glycosphingolipids, and some los are sialylated.
AB  == the lipooligosaccharides (los) of strains of haemophilus ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria lactamica contain epitopes that are antigenically and structurally similar to carbohydrates present in human glycosphingolipids. los from strains of haemophilus influenzae and h. influenzae  biogroup aegyptius were tested for the binding of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that bind to human glycosphingolipids possessing gal beta 1-4glcnac (mab 3f11) and gal alpha 1-4gal beta 1-4glc (mab anti-pk). in solid-phase radioimmunoassays, the los of 18 of 19 h. influenzae type b (hib), 8 of 19 nontypeable h. influenzae, and 10 of 20 h. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains bound mab anti-pk. the los of 13 of 19 hib, 10 of 16 nontypeable h. influenzae, and 2 of 18 h. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains bound mab 3f11. neuraminidase treatment  of the strains increased the binding of mab 3f11 by more than twofold in 47% of the h. influenzae strains, suggesting that sialic acid occluded the los structure recognized by mab 3f11. the material released from neuraminidase-treated hib los  was confirmed to be sialic acid by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. a recombinant plasmid containing genes involved in hib los biosynthesis directed the expression (assembly) of the 3f11 epitope in escherichia coli. these studies demonstrate that h. influenzae and h. influenzae  biogroup aegyptius express at least two los epitopes that are similar to those present in human glycosphingolipids. sialic acid was present on the los of some h. influenzae strains and prevented the binding of mab 3f11 to its epitope. the oligosaccharide portion of sialylated los may also resemble sialylated oligosaccharides present in human glycosphingolipids (gangliosides).

AB  == virtually complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for 54 representative strains of species in the family pasteurellaceae. of these strains, 15 were pasteurella, 16 were actinobacillus, and 23 were haemophilus. a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence similarity, using the neighbor-joining method.  fifty-three of the strains fell within four large clusters. the first cluster included the type strains of haemophilus influenzae, h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. haemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus, h. segnis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. this cluster also contained a. actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, atcc 29522, atcc 29523, and atcc 29524 and h. aphrophilus nctc 7901. the second cluster included the type strains of a. seminis and pasteurella aerogenes  and h. somnus ovcg 43826. the third cluster was composed of the type strains of pasteurella multocida, p. anatis, p. avium, p. canis, p. dagmatis, p. gallinarum, p. langaa, p. stomatis, p. volantium, h. haemoglobinophilus, h. parasuis, h. paracuniculus, h. paragallinarum, and a. capsulatus. this cluster also contained  pasteurella species a ccug 18782, pasteurella species b ccug 19974, haemophilus taxon c capm 5111, h. parasuis type 5 nagasaki, p. volantium (h. parainfluenzae)  nctc 4101, and p. trehalosi nctc 10624. the fourth cluster included the type strains of actinobacillus lignieresii, a. equuli, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. suis, a. ureae, h. parahaemolyticus, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. ducreyi, and p. haemolytica. this cluster also contained actinobacillus species strain ccug 19799 (bisgaard taxon 11), a. suis atcc 15557, h. ducreyi atcc 27722  and hd 35000, haemophilus minor group strain 202, and h. parainfluenzae atcc 29242. the type strain of p. pneumotropica branched alone to form a fifth group.  the branching of the pasteurellaceae family tree was quite complex. the four major clusters contained multiple subclusters. the clusters contained both rapidly and slowly evolving strains (indicated by differing numbers of base changes incorporated into the 16s rrna sequence relative to outgroup organisms).  while the results presented a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationships, the complexity of the branching will make division of the family into genera a difficult and somewhat subjective task. we do not suggest any taxonomic changes at this time.

TI  == antigenic diversity in haemophilus ducreyi as shown by western blot (immunoblot)  analysis.
AB  == the antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. when a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. parahaemolyticus was used, the  immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human  immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kda. preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. there was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. with a serum pool adsorbed on the haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  pasteurella ureae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for h. ducreyi were identified. an immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kda protein was expressed by all h. ducreyi isolates. in the range from 34 to 30 kda, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. by using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kda and 34 to 30 kda) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.

TI  == characterization of an 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein of haemophilus ducreyi that contains a conserved surface-exposed epitope.
AB  == identification of antigenically conserved surface components of haemophilus ducreyi may facilitate the development of reagents to diagnose and prevent chancroid. a hybridoma derived from a mouse immunized with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae produced a monoclonal antibody (mab), designated 3b9, that bound to 35 of 35 h. ducreyi strains isolated from diverse geographic regions. the mab 3b9 bound to a non-heat-modifiable h. ducreyi outer membrane protein (omp) whose apparent molecular weight was 18,000 (the 18k omp), and the 3b9 epitope did not phase vary at a rate of greater than 10(-3) in h. ducreyi. in immunoelectron microscopy, the 3b9 epitope was surface exposed, and there was intrastrain and interstrain variability in the amount of 3b9 labelling of whole cells. the mab 3b9 cross-reacted with many species of the family pasteurellaceae  and bound to the 16.6k peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (p6 or pal) of h. influenzae. unlike p6, the 18k omp did not copurify with peptidoglycan. in western blots (immunoblots), five of seven serum samples obtained from patients with chancroid and four of five serum samples obtained from patients with other genital ulcer diseases at the time of presentation contained antibodies that bound to the 18k omp. in a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, four of these serum samples inhibited the binding of 3b9 to h. ducreyi by more than 50%.  we conclude that members of pasteurellaceae expressed a conserved epitope on omps that sometimes had different physical characteristics. patients with chancroid usually have antibodies to the 18k omp and the 3b9 epitope that may have resulted from infection with h. ducreyi or previous exposure to other haemophilus or actinobacillus sp. strains.

TI  == role of lipooligosaccharides in experimental dermal lesions caused by haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == the mouse and rabbit intradermal injection models have been used to define factors that may be important in haemophilus ducreyi pathogenesis. we used h. ducreyi strains with diverse geographic origins and phenotypic characteristics to evaluate the experimental models. injection of live and heat-killed bacteria caused skin abscesses in both models. semiquantitative cultures of skin injected  with live bacteria showed that h. ducreyi failed to replicate in animal tissue. these data suggested that the experimental lesions were caused by a heat-stable substance such as lipooligosaccharide (los). in mice, injection of h. ducreyi and haemophilus influenzae los and escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide caused mild to moderate inflammation. in rabbits, injection of h. ducreyi los caused intradermal abscesses that were histologically similar to those caused by live and heat-killed bacteria. h. ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae los caused significantly larger lesions than equivalent amounts of h. influenzae los and e.  coli lipopolysaccharide in the rabbit model. we conclude that the intradermal injection models are not valid models to study the growth of h. ducreyi in vivo.  however, these data indicate that h. ducreyi los may play an important role in the pathogenesis of chancroid and that the rabbit model should be useful in studying h. ducreyi los toxicity at the cellular level.

AB  == protein d, a novel surface protein of the bacterial species haemophilus influenzae with specific affinity for human immunoglobulin (ig) d was detected in all 127 h. influenzae strains studied. all strains representing different serotypes of encapsulated strains and different biotypes of nonencapsulated strains bound 125i-labeled igd to a high degree (38 to 74%). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that protein d from all h. influenzae strains had the same apparent molecular weight (i.e., 42,000) and reacted with all three different anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies. by scatchard analysis, the number of protein d residues  on a nontypeable h. influenzae strain was estimated to be approximately 2,800 per organism. the equilibrium constant for the reaction between a human igd myeloma protein and igd was found to be 5.8 x 10(8) m-1. also, all strains of h. haemolyticus and h. aegypticus strains tested bound igd, 21 to 28% and 41 to 48%, respectively. in extracts of those bacteria, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein reactive with igd and all three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies was found. in h. parainfluenzae, h. aphrophilus, h. paraphrophilus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a 42,000-molecular-weight protein that was reactive with one to three of three anti-protein d monoclonal antibodies but not reactive with  human igd was detected with western blot analysis. other haemophilus species (h.  ducreyi, h. parasuis, h. parahaemolyticus, h. segnis, and h. haemoglobinophilus)  did not react with human monoclonal igd or anti-protein d antibodies. on the basis of the wide distribution of protein d among h. influenzae strains, we suggest that protein d could be a vaccine candidate.

AB  == the non-enteric gram-negative human pathogens, b. catarrhalis, h. ducreyi, h. influenzae, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis, do not have repeating o-antigens  as part of their principle surface glycolipid, the lipooligosaccharide (los). because they have similar los structures, we studied the conservation of los oligosaccharide epitopes among these organisms. twenty-one monoclonal antibodies  (mabs) generated by immunizing mice with h. influenzae, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis were studied for cross reactivity. five mabs generated against non-typable h. influenzae were the only strain-specific antibodies. ten mabs reacted to los epitope(s) common to a genera or species, and six mabs bound to epitope(s) on the los of strains from different genera. some cross reactive mabs  bound to los bands of similar molecular weights, while others bound to bands of varying molecular weights. mab 3f11, whose epitope mimics a human blood-group antigen, bound to a 4.8 kda los band in n. gonorrhoeae and h. ducreyi, two pathogens that infect genital epithelium. mab 3d9, whose epitope consists of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid (kdo), reacted with different los bands in n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae and some r mutants of s. minnesota. a 14 kb restriction fragment containing lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes responsible for the assembly of the 3d9 epitope in h. influenzae hybridized to all h. influenzae strains tested but did not hybridize to gonococcal and s. minnesota strains that expressed this epitope. these studies demonstrate that conserved los epitope(s) exist among different species and genera of non-enteric human pathogens and that different genetic mechanisms may have evolved in these pathogens to assemble some of these conserved epitopes.

TI  == biology of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == the etiological agent of the sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease chancroid was first described in 1889 by auguste ducrey following repeated autoinoculation  of purulent ulcer material from a series of patients. the organism was isolated on artificial media a decade later but has remained difficult to isolate consistently, resulting in controversy over its characteristics and role as the causative agent of chancroid. because of its fastidious growth requirements, including unknown components in blood, the organism was included in the original  description of the genus haemophilus. requirement for exogenous hemin and limited phenotypic characteristics, including structural and antigenic properties, suggested that haemophilus ducreyi was a valid member of the genus haemophilus. recent studies of respiratory quinones, deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, and  competition for homologous transformation of the type species, h. influenzae, suggest that h. ducreyi is unrelated to any of the present species of the family  pasteurellaceae, which includes members of the genera haemophilus, actinobacillus, and pasteurella. this review summarizes the early studies with h. ducreyi and our current knowledge of the microbiology of this important human pathogen.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies specific for haemophilus ducreyi: a screening method to discriminate specific and cross-reacting antibodies.
AB  == haemophilus ducreyi is the etiological agent of chancroid. the organism shares extensive immunological cross-reactivity with other haemophilus species. this presents substantial difficulties for the production of specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). a competition elisa was devised for hybridoma screening which  allowed the detection of h. ducreyi-specific antibody-producing hybridoma cultures during the initial screening process. with this screening method, seven  mabs specific for h. ducreyi were obtained in a single cell fusion exercise. the  specificities of the 7 mabs were demonstrated by direct elisa and dot immunobinding assays against several strains each of h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. five of the mabs reacted against all ten strains of h. ducreyi. these mabs may permit the development of rapid and efficient immunodiagnostics for chancroid. the principle of the competition elisa for hybridoma screening should be widely applicable to the development of specific mabs to other organisms in which immunological cross-reactivity is an impediment to hybridoma screening by conventional methods.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the enterobacteriaceae (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l). the activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. all of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against vibrio cholerae (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) aeromonas hydrophila (mic less than or equal to 0.03  mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), neisseria spp., haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, bordetella pertussis and legionella pneumophila (mic less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic streptococcus spp. (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l), corynebacterium diphtheriae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and cory. jeikeium (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococcus spp., str. pneumoniae and listeria monocytogenes (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and str. faecalis (mic less than or equal to 8 mg/l). the activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. clostridium perfringens (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and cl. difficile (mic less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more  resistant. ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against chlamydia trachomatis sa2f (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == antigenic analysis of haemophilus ducreyi by western blotting.
AB  == twenty-one strains of haemophilus ducreyi were analysed by western blotting using two antisera produced in mice. common antigens of molecular weights 58, 46, 41, 28, 22 and 16 kda were detected in all the strains. the antigens were protein in  nature, since they could not be detected in whole-cell lysates which had been treated with proteinase k. the h. ducreyi strains showed antigenic cross-reactivity with strains of h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, but showed  minimal or no cross-reactivity with seven other species of bacteria.

TI  == origin of small beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids in haemophilus species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == fifty-nine percent of unselected strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae were found to carry small, phenotypically cryptic plasmid dna species. using filter blot hybridization, we found several plasmids which were homologous to the small beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids pjb1 and pfa7, which were originally isolated  from haemophilus ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. detailed filter hybridization studies combined with electron microscope heteroduplex analysis suggested that three cryptic plasmids are completely homologous to the non-tna sequences of pjb1. one cryptic plasmid was found to be highly homologous to pjb603, a small beta-lactamase plasmid previously found in two isolates of h. influenzae. a second group of plasmids were found to carry sequences homologous to pjb1 and other sequences homologous to pjb603. these results strongly suggest  that small beta-lactamase plasmids found in haemophilus species and n. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of the transposable beta-lactamase-specifying element tna into small, phenotypically cryptic replicons resident in h. parainfluenzae. attempts to reproduce such a recombination event in the laboratory were not successful.

TI  == use of dot-immunobinding and immunofluorescence assays to investigate clinically  suspected cases of chancroid.
AB  == in 1984 and 1985, outbreaks of genital ulcers occurred in florida and new york. initial investigations for syphilis, herpes simplex, chlamydia trachomatis, and haemophilus ducreyi did not implicate any of these organisms as etiologic agents. from the results of dot-immunobinding assays, we found that sera from the patients had higher levels of igm (30 [47.6%] of 63 patients) and igg (22 [34.9%] of 63 patients) reactivities with an outer-membrane preparation from h. ducreyi strain cip542 than with outer-membrane preparations from haemophilus influenzae atcc 10211 or haemophilus parainfluenzae atcc 7901. in contrast, sera from 35 patients in the control group did not react with any of the outer-membrane preparations (p less than .01 for both igm and and igg reactivity), nor did sera  from eight individuals with disease caused by h. influenzae (p = .051 for igm reactivity, p = .02 for igg reactivity). indirect immunofluorescence assay using  a monoclonal antibody reactive with outer-membrane preparations from h. ducreyi strain cip542 stained organisms in smears of lesion material from genital ulcers  from three of six patients. these results suggested that the cause of both outbreaks of genital ulcers was h. ducreyi which was subsequently isolated in both geographic areas.

TI  == molecular characterization of chloramphenicol-resistant haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == we examined chloramphenicol-resistant haemophilus parainfluenzae and haemophilus  ducreyi strains isolated in various parts of the world. the antibiotic resistance determinants were located on conjugative plasmids in h. ducreyi, but were chromosomally located in h. parainfluenzae. both species produced chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (cats) that were sensitive to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) like the enteric type ii and haemophilus influenzae cat enzymes, but differed from these enzymes in elution patterns and subunit molecular weight. southern blot analysis showed the h. parainfluenzae and h. ducreyi cat genes were molecularly related to the enteric type ii class as well as the h. influenzae cat. heterogeneity of the physiochemical properties of the cats was observed; however, the data suggested that all three haemophilus spp. have a common ancestral source for the cats.

TI  == amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate: an antibiotic combination. mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, antimicrobial spectrum, clinical efficacy and adverse effects.
AB  == the combination of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate will soon be marketed in 2:1 and 4:1 fixed ratio dosage forms. in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that clavulanic acid, a potent inhibitor of many bacterial beta-lactamase enzymes, will increase the spectrum of amoxicillin to include, at achievable serum concentrations, haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus and branhamella catarralis and, at achievable urine levels, many beta-lactamase-producing strains of e. coli, klebsiella, proteus and citrobacter. both amoxicillin and clavulanic are well absorbed after oral administration, reach peak serum levels in 40-120 min and have similar half-lives of 45 to 90 min. this combination will be suitable for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, otitis media, sinusitis and respiratory tract infections. however, precise recommendations for its use will need to await further clinical trials that compare amoxicillin/clavulanate to alternative therapies.

TI  == isolation of haemophilus species from the genital tract.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae was isolated from the urethra of three of 85 men attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic. these isolates of h. influenzae were nonencapsulated; one was biotype iii, and two were biotype iv. haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated from the urethra or coronal sulcus of five men; three isolates were biotype ii, and two were biotype iii. neither h. influenzae nor h.  parainfluenzae was isolated from the genital secretions of 84 women. haemophilus  ducreyi and haemophilus equigenitalis (contagious equine metritis bacterium) were not isolated from any of the 169 patients.

TI  == evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids in neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus species.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae has required fundamental changes in the antimicrobial therapy of disease caused by these organisms. ampicillin resistance in both organisms is caused by plasmid mediated production of tem beta-lactamase. this enzyme is specified by a sequence of mol. wt 3.2 x 10(6) which is capable of inserting itself at multiple sites in dna replicons without the requirement for significant base sequence homology between donor and recipient replicon. further, it does so without requirement for conventional recombination enzymes. analysis of beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of h. influenzae show that they generally have a molecular mass in the order of 30 x 10(6) and contain the complete tna sequence. they are conjugative but are incapable of mobilizing smaller beta-lactamase plasmids. previous studies have presented evidence suggesting that these plasmids may have evolved by insertion of the tna sequence (perhaps introduced from enteric bacteria) into a phenotypically cryptic plasmid of mol. wt 27 x 10(6) resident in rare strains of h. influenzae. in this study, we review data showing a high degree of homology between the small (3--7 x 10(6) mol. wt),  nonconjugative beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of n. gonorrhoeae, h. parainfluenzae and h. ducreyl and present new evidence that cryptic plasmids highly homologous to the beta-lactamase plasmids are present in many strains of h. parainfluenzae. this suggests that the small beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi and n. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of tna into phenotypically cryptic plasmids present in h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae: comparison of respiratory tract isolates with genitourinary tract isolates.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates recovered from the genitourinary (gu) tract were  shown to have a significantly different biotype distribution compared with respiratory tract isolates. biotype iv strains were recovered more commonly from  the gu tract, and most strains were non-serotypable. antibiotic-susceptible strains isolated from the gu tract more frequently harbored plasmids of less than 10 megadaltons than did antibiotic-susceptible respiratory tract strains. one 2.8-megadalton plasmid resident in a gu tract isolate and one 1.8-megadalton plasmid resident in a respiratory tract isolate were shown to be related to the small ampicillin resistance plasmids previously described in h. influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus ducreyi, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. this  supports the suggestion that these ampicillin resistance plasmids originated by transposition or recombination of the ampicillin transposon (tna) with cryptic endogenous haemophilus plasmids.

TI  == mobilization of nonconjugative antibiotic resistance plasmids in haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == a clinical isolate of haemophilus ducreyi was found to harbor three plasmids: a 23.5-megadalton (mdal) phenotypically cryptic plasmid, a 7.0-mdal ampicillin resistance plasmid, and a 4.0-mdal sulfonamide resistance plasmid. the two smaller plasmids were transferable by conjugation to haemophilus recipients, but  only if the donor cell harbored the 23.5-mdal plasmid as well, indicating that this large plasmid had mobilizing capabilities. transfer was also possible to escherichia coli recipients. haemophilus influenzae transconjugants which had acquired both the 23.5-mdal plasmid and one of the r-plasmids could subsequently  retransfer the r-plasmid to other haemophilus recipients at higher frequencies. a derivative of the 23.5 mdal plasmid was isolated which was shown by restriction endonuclease analysis to contain an ampicillin resistance transposon and to have  retained its conjugative ability.

TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.

TI  == plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == three of 19 strains of haemophilus ducreyi, isolated during a recent outbreak of  chancroid, were found to produce beta-lactamase and to harbor a 6.0 x 10(6)-dalton plasmid. escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid acquired beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to ampicillin. the guanine-plus-cytosine content of the plasmid was found to be 41 mol%. restriction endonuclease digestion studies suggest that a relatively large portion of the tn1 translocon is carried by this plasmid. whereas this plasmid could not be transferred to h. influenzae by mating on membrane filters, a strain of h. ducreyi was able to receive and donate a 30 x 10(6)-dalton ampicillin resistance plasmid from h. influenzae. the ability of h. ducreyi to receive and donate conjugative plasmids  may result in the appearance of multiply resistant strains.

TI  == a taxonomic study of the genus haemophilus, with the proposal of a new species.
AB  == a collection of 426 haemophilus strains isolated from people with infectious diseases and from the normal flora of mucous membranes in humans and various animal species was studied in an attempt to revise and improve the taxonomy of the genus haemophilus. the examinations included the determination of a number of biochemical and physiological properties, of which several had not previously been applied to the taxonomy of haemophili. the resulting data reavealed many hitherto unrecognized characters of taxonomic significance and several of the species can now be more accurately defined. the classification presented is supported by the dna base composition of a large number of representative strains. a diagnostic key to the different taxa is presented. haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae have been subdivided into a number of biotypes.  it is possible to demonstrate a relationship between the individual biotypes of h. influenzae and the origin of the strains assigned to them. the results indicate that h. aegyptius, h. parahaemolyticus and h. paraphrohaemolyticus do not merit specific status. four unnamed taxa of v-factor-dependent haemophili have been recognized. the name haemophilus segnis is proposed for one of these taxa, which consists mainly of strains isolated from the human oral cavity. it is demonstrated that the name h. ducreyi has been used for different groups of bacteria, and that only one of these groups can legitimately be assigned to the genus haemophilus. haemolytic v-factor-dependent strains from swine, previously included in h. parahaemolyticus, are significantly different from strains of human origin and should be named h. pleuropneumoniae. none of the strains from swine and fowls were haemin-dependent. the relationships of these strains to the  species h. suis and h. gallinarum, and to h. parasuis and h. paragallinarum are discussed. haemophilus piscium is shown not to belong to the genus haemophilus. the taxonomic position of h. aphrophilus is uncertain and its possible relationship to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires further study. the  positive correlation found between the ecology of the strains studied and their affiliation with the different taxa is discussed.
