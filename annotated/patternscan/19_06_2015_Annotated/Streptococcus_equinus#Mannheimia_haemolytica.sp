TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == observations on salpingitis, peritonitis and salpingoperitonitis in a layer breeder flock.
AB  == a flock of 13,951 hens and 1379 cockerels was monitored from 26 to 58 weeks of age for the complex of salpingitis, peritonitis and salpingoperitonitis (sps). two hundred and forty-three hens (78 per cent of the hens that died) were examined postmortem, and sps was recognised by gross examination for inflammatory exudate, in the body cavity or oviduct in 111 (46 per cent) of them. salpingoperitonitis was the most common form, followed by salpingitis and then peritonitis. there were acute and chronic cases in all three conditions, but only in peritonitis were acute cases more common than chronic cases. seventeen birds that had died of sps were cultured for aerobic bacteria within 12 hours of death. escherichia coli was recovered from a variety of tissues from all of them, and other bacteria, including staphylococci, mannheimia haemolytica and streptococcus bovis, were isolated from a few carcases, either alone or together with e coli. relatively few isolations of e coli were made from normal hens cultured 48, 72 and 96 hours after death.

TI  == [bacterially conditioned thromboembolism in dairy cows--a retrospective study of  31 necropsy cases with special consideration of the causative complex].
AB  == a study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. the most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). the most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by staphylococcus aureus (2), mannheimia haemolytica (2) and streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. in 27  of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.

TI  == otitis in cattle, an aetiological review.
AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == [pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group a, n = 13) and their controls (group b, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group c, n = 90) or without (group d, n = 10) lesions were collected after  slaughter. arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from  calves in group a (46%), followed by haemophilus somnus (23%), mannheimia haemolytica (15%), streptococcus suis and pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). only s. suis (22%) and p. multocida (11%) were found in group b. p. multocida was isolated from 32% group c calves, h. somnus from 11%, a. pyogenes from 7.8%, m. haemolytica from 2.2% and s. suis from 1.1%. no specific pathogens were isolated  in group d. prevalence of mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group a and 37% in group c. ninety-eight strains were tested for resistance to antibiotics. resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in m. haemolytica (46%). high percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the  area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of  mycoplasma bovis.
