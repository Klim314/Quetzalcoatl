TI  == discovery of a cyclic phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis  of both ester bonds to phosphorus.
AB  == the bacterial c-p lyase pathway is responsible for the metabolism of unactivated  organophosphonates under conditions of phosphate starvation. the cleavage of the  c-p bond within ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-phosphate to form methane and 5-phospho-ribose-1,2-cyclic phosphate (prcp) is catalyzed by the radical sam enzyme phnj. in escherichia coli the cyclic phosphate product is hydrolyzed to ribose-1,5-bisphosphate by phnp. in this study, we describe the discovery and characterization of an enzyme that can hydrolyze a cyclic phosphodiester directly to a vicinal diol and inorganic phosphate. with prcp, this enzyme hydrolyzes the  phosphate ester at carbon-1 of the ribose moiety to form ribose-2,5-bisphosphate, and then this intermediate is hydrolyzed to ribose-5-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. ribose-1,5-bisphosphate is neither an intermediate nor a substrate for this enzyme. orthologues of this enzyme are found in the human pathogens clostridium difficile and eggerthella lenta. we propose that this enzyme be called cyclic phosphate dihydrolase (cpdh) and be designated as phnpp.

TI  == microbial and immunological responses relative to high-altitude exposure in mountaineers.
AB  == purpose: high-altitude exposure is often associated with gastrointestinal disorders, inflammation, and an increased risk of infection. we suspected microbial and immunological responses to high-altitude exposure in mountaineers resulting from changes in the balance of the intestinal microflora. methods: we investigated fecal samples and serum of seven mountaineers who took part in a 47-d german expedition to the nepalese himalayas in 2002, for microbial response  by changes in different fecal bacterial population groups (fluorescent in situ hybridization), immune response by serum levels of igg-, igm-, and iga anti-lps (e. coli j5), and inflammatory response by serum levels of c-reactive protein (crp) (elisa). in addition, measurements of body temperature, pulse rate, arterial oxygen saturation, and questionnaire (lake louise score for altitude illness) were performed. results: the data indicate a distinct alteration in the  composition of the fecal microflora relative to high-altitude exposure above 5000 m. bifidobacteria and species belonging to the atopobium, coriobacterium, and eggerthella lenta group decreased, whereas potential pathogenic bacteria of the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria and specific enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli increased. possible endotoxemia resulting from the increase of the latter gram-negative bacteria was indirectly indicated by the reduction in serum levels of igm- and/or iga anti-lps. crp was elevated relative to high-altitude exposure. the lake louise score correlated with the changes in crp, iga-, and igm anti-lps but did not correlate with the bacterial alterations. conclusion: changes in the composition of intestinal microbiota may be associated with indicators of an immunological challenge and may result in an increased health risk of mountaineers during exposure to very high altitude.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
