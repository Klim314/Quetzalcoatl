TI  - Iron induces bimodal population development by Escherichia coli.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm formation is a complex developmental process involving cellular differentiation and the formation of intricate 3D structures. Here we demonstrate that exposure to ferric chloride triggers rugose biofilm formation by the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain UTI89 and by enteric bacteria Citrobacter koseri and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. Two unique and separable cellular populations emerge in iron-triggered, rugose biofilms. Bacteria at the air-biofilm interface express high levels of the biofilm regulator csgD, the cellulose activator adrA, and the curli subunit operon csgBAC. Bacteria in the interior of rugose biofilms express low levels of csgD and undetectable levels of matrix components curli and cellulose. Iron activation of rugose biofilms is linked to oxidative stress. Superoxide generation, either through addition of phenazine methosulfate or by deletion of sodA and sodB, stimulates rugose biofilm formation in the absence of high iron. Additionally, overexpression of Mn-superoxide dismutase, which can mitigate iron-derived reactive oxygen stress, decreases biofilm formation in a WT strain upon iron exposure. Not only does reactive oxygen stress promote rugose biofilm formation, but bacteria in the rugose biofilms display increased resistance to H(2)O(2) toxicity. Altogether, we demonstrate that iron and superoxide stress trigger rugose biofilm formation in UTI89. Rugose biofilm development involves the elaboration of two distinct bacterial populations and increased resistance to oxidative stress.
TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - Promiscuous cross-seeding between bacterial amyloids promotes interspecies biofilms.
AB  - Amyloids are highly aggregated proteinaceous fibers historically associated with  neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and prion-based encephalopathies. Polymerization of amyloidogenic proteins into ordered fibers can be accelerated by preformed amyloid aggregates derived from the same protein in a process called seeding. Seeding of disease-associated amyloids and prions is highly specific and cross-seeding is usually limited or prevented. Here we describe the first study on the cross-seeding potential of bacterial functional amyloids. Curli are produced on the surface of many Gram-negative bacteria where they facilitate surface attachment and biofilm development. Curli fibers are composed of the major subunit CsgA and the nucleator CsgB, which templates CsgA into fibers. Our results showed that curli subunit homologs from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium LT2, and Citrobacter koseri were able to cross-seed in vitro. The polymerization of Escherichia coli CsgA was also accelerated by fibers derived from a distant homolog in Shewanella oneidensis that shares less than 30% identity in primary sequence. Cross-seeding of curli proteins was also observed in mixed colony biofilms with E. coli and S. typhimurium. CsgA was secreted from E. coli csgB- mutants assembled into fibers on adjacent S. typhimurium that presented CsgB on its surfaces. Similarly, CsgA was secreted by S. typhimurium csgB- mutants formed curli on CsgB-presenting E. coli. This interspecies curli assembly enhanced bacterial attachment to agar surfaces and supported pellicle biofilm formation. Collectively, this work suggests that the seeding specificity among curli homologs is relaxed and that heterogeneous curli fibers can facilitate multispecies biofilm development.
TI  - Chromosomally encoded blaCMY-2 located on a novel SXT/R391-related integrating conjugative element in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  - Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. Although SXT/R391-related ICEs, originally demonstrated in Vibrio cholerae O139 isolates, have become prevalent among V. cholerae isolates in Asia, the prevalence of the ICEs among gram-negative bacteria other than Vibrio spp. remains unknown. In addition, SXT/R391-related ICEs carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. Here we carried out a genetic analysis of a cefoxitin-resistant Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, TUM4660, which revealed the presence of a novel SXT/R391-related ICE, ICEPmiJpn1. ICEPmiJpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of R391 and carried xis and int genes completely identical to those of R391, while an IS10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(CMY-2) was integrated into the ICE. A nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of ISEcp1 was located upstream of the bla(CMY-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(CMY-2) in earlier studies were also present. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in ICEPmiJpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in SXT(MO10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in P. mirabilis ATCC 29906, respectively. ICEPmiJpn1 was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. These observations suggest that ICEs may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant Enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ICEs, including SXT/R391-related ICEs.
TI  - Characterization of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA of Enterobacter sakazakii and  development of a species-specific PCR method.
AB  - The gene encoding the 16S rRNA of Enterobacter (E.) sakazakii (ATCC 29544, plus four strains isolated from powdered infant formula) was studied, and the sequence compared with those of other Enterobacteriaceae in aspects of genetic variability. Sequence differences between E. sakazakii and other Enterobacteriaceae within the hypervariable regions V1, V2, and V3, respectively, were used to develop two PCR methods for E. sakazakii. PCR1 employed a primer pair located in V1/V2, while PCR2 utilized a primer pair located in V1/V3, respectively. The two PCR methods were tested against a set of 57 E. sakazakii and 148 non-E. sakazakii isolates. PCR1 gave an amplicon with a size of 406 bp and resulted in 100% positive results for E. sakazakii, but also detected Citrobacter koseri/amalonaticus and all nine tested Salmonella enterica serovars. In contrast, PCR2 (amplicon size of 952 bp) gave positive results only for E. sakazakii, thus allowing specific identification of this species.
TI  - [Use of semi-solid Diasalm medium for isolation of Salmonella enteritidis].
AB  - The Diagnostic Semi-solid Salmonella Agar (DIASALM) was compared with two commercial semi-solid Rappaport-Vasiliadis media (MSRV by Oxoid and SRVA, basis by HiMedia) using 52 strains of Salmonella and 10 strains of interfering Gram-negative bacteria. The diagnostic potency for salmonellae was higher in DIASALM than in MSRV or SRVA. Unlike the Rappaport-Vasiliadis media, DIASALM contains a diagnostic system consisting of lactose, saccharose and bromocresol purple, allowing the differentiation of salmonellae from non-pathogenic Gram-negative sugar-fermenting bacteria (Tab. I). The semi-solid media were supplemented with 0.0015% nitrofurantoine to recover specifically Salmonella enteritidis. Eighty percent of strains of the latter serovar were resistant to this chemotherapeutic agent, while all the other serovars were sensitive to it. The use of discs soaked with the monovalent Salmonella antiserum H:g,m increased the recovery rate in 95 percent of S. enteritidis strains. Compared with the cultures from peptone water, the diameters of the migration zones formed by the positive cultures grown in M-broth were larger by 3 to 5 mm. Pure cultures of salmonellae were isolated in 98% of cases from the borders of the migration zones when mixed cultures of salmonellae (a S. enteritidis isolate from a patient, density 10(3) to 1 or 2 cells per drop) and Citrobacter koseri or Edwardsiella tarda, or Proteus mirabilis, or Psedomonas aeruginosa (densities > or = 10(3) cells per drop) were inoculated onto DIASALM (Tab III).
