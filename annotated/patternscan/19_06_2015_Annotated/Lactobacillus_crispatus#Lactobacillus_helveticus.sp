TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from bulgarian women.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. the development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of  vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation.  the aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal lactobacillus  isolates obtained from bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. a combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. all vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ardra results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. finally, the strains were  subjected to pcr analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following  species: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ardra or ribotyping, followed by pcr specific primers identification at species level.

TI  == lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov., from chicken intestine.
AB  == four strains isolated from chicken small intestine and strains jcm 1038 and jcm 1039 (designated as lactobacillus acidophilus) were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. they were gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods that did not produce gas from glucose. these strains had similar phenotypic characteristics and exhibited intergroup dna relatedness values of >77 %, indicating that they comprised a single species. the 16s rrna gene sequence of a representative strain, jcm 1039(t) (designated as type strain  in this study), was determined and aligned with those of other lactobacillus species. jcm 1039(t) was placed in the lactobacillus delbrueckii cluster of the genus lactobacillus on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and formed an independent cluster that was distinct from its closest neighbours, lactobacillus  amylovorus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, l. acidophilus and lactobacillus helveticus. results of dna-dna hybridization experiments and whole-cell protein profiles clearly indicated that these strains represent a novel lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of this species is jcm 1039(t).

TI  == the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria: surface constituents and macromolecular conformations.
AB  == a variety of strains of the genus lactobacillus was investigated with respect to  the structure, softness, and interactions of their outer surface layers in order  to construct structure-property relations of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall. the role of the conformational properties of the constituents of the outer  cell-wall layers and their spatial distribution on the cell wall is emphasized. atomic force microscopy was used to resolve the surface structure, interactions,  and softness of the bacterial cell wall at nanometer-length scales and upwards. the ph-dependence of the electrophoretic mobility and a novel interfacial adhesion assay were used to analyze the average physicochemical properties of the bacterial strains. the bacterial surface is smooth when a compact layer of globular proteins constitutes the outer surface, e.g., the s-layer of l. crispatus dsm20584. in contrast, for two other s-layer containing strains (l. helveticus atcc12046 and l. helveticus atcc15009), the s-layer is covered by polymeric surface constituents which adopt a much more extended conformation and  which confer a certain roughness to the surface. consequently, the s-layer is important for the overall surface properties of l. crispatus, but not for the surface properties of l. helveticus. both surface proteins (l. crispatus dsm20584) and (lipo)teichoic acids (l. johnsonii atcc332) confer hydrophobic properties to the bacterial surface whereas polysaccharides (l. johnsonii dsm20533 and l. johnsonii atcc 33200) render the bacterial surface hydrophilic. using the interfacial adhesion assay, it was demonstrated that hydrophobic groups within the cell wall adsorb limited quantities of hydrophobic compounds. the present work demonstrates that the impressive variation in surface properties displayed by even a limited number of genetically-related bacterial strains can be understood in terms of established colloidal concepts, provided that sufficiently detailed structural, chemical, and conformational information on the surface constituents is available.

TI  == imaging of lactic acid bacteria with afm--elasticity and adhesion maps and their  relationship to biological and structural data.
AB  == the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to the intestinal epithelium is one of the most important factors determining probiotic ability of a bacterial strain. studying bacterial adhesion requires knowledge of the structure and properties of the bacterial surface, which can be studied by atomic force microscopy under native conditions. the observation of the surface topography of bacteria from the species lactobacillus crispatus, l. helveticus and l. johnsonii shows major differences between bacteria having a crystalline-like protein layer as part of the cell wall and those without such layers. force volume images calculated into  elasticity and adhesion force maps of different bacterial strains show that l. crispatus and l. helveticus have a surface with a homogeneous stiffness with no adhesion events. this is most likely caused by the s-layer, which completely covers the surface of the bacteria. we infer that the absence of adhesion peaks is caused by the semi-crystalline character of such protein layers, in agreement  with the results obtained from electron microscopy. analysis of a number of l. johnsonii strains shows that these bacteria have surface properties which strongly differ from the l. crispatus and l. helveticus strains. for l. johnsonii dms20533 and l. johnsonii atcc33200 high adhesion forces are observed, which can  be related to a surface rich in polysaccharides. l. johnsonii atcc332 has lower adhesion forces compared to the other two and, furthermore, the surface topography shows depressions. we suppose that this strain has a surface pattern consisting of crystalline-like proteins alternating with polysaccharide-rich domains. the wide variety in surface properties of lactobacilli could well have wide-ranging implications for food processing and for health benefits.

TI  == the s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the  s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac  domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l.  crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped  cells or to lactobacillus casei.

TI  == lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.

TI  == a polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  == a set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the lactobacillus acidophilus rrna-group have been analysed by sds-page of cellular proteins, rapd-pcr and aflp with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, l. gallinarum, l. helveticus, l. iners and l. amylolyticus. although the majority of the species can be differentiated by sds-page of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains and between some strains of l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum. however, this study shows that the rapd-pcr (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and aflp are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. the separate species status of the recently described l. amylolyticus and l. iners was fully confirmed.

TI  == molecular identification of potentially probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == the rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes are useful for the identification of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, and l. amylovorus. however, the oligonucleotide probe designed for l. helveticus hybridized with nucleic acids of type strains of l. gallinarum and l. helveticus. hence, the similarity among the 73 strains of lactobacilli was evaluated on the basis of their randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) profiles derived from five single-primer reactions. these strains were grouped into seven clusters at a similarity level of 30%, which corresponded to six separate species of the l. acidophilus complex (l. johnsonii, l. gallinarum, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri, respectively) and l. helveticus. for the first time, strains of l. gallinarum were characterized by rapd and pfge analyses. the genome length in that species was estimated to be near 1.45 mb with the summation of apai fragments, and near 1.95 mb with the summation of smai fragments.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == a lactobacillus helveticus-specific dna probe detects restriction fragment length polymorphisms in this species.
AB  == a cloned 2-kb ecori fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total dnas of 75 l. helveticus strains. no hybridization was found with l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l.  gasseri, or l. intestinalis strains. when southern blots of ecori digests of l. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.
