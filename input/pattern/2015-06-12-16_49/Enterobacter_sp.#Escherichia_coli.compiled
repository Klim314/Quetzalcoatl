TI  - Microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a University hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in State University of Campinas, no data has been published yet. METHODS: The main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. The blood culture records requested from 4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The samples were processed using the Bact/Alert(R) system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). There were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). The prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (15.87%), Escherichia coli (13.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), Enterobacter sp (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and Candida sp (5.1%). Examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 80% of the CNS isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For A. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for P. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When all Gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. For empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.
TI  - [Profile and susceptibility to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children and newborns from 2012 to 2013: Data from 1879 urine cultures].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We present recent data on the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogenic bacteria isolated in children and newborns in our region over the past 2years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study on the positive urine cultures from pediatric and neonatal populations during 2012-2013. Bacteria were identified using conventional methods. Susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted as recommended by the committee of the susceptibility of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM). RESULTS: We collected 1879 non-redundant bacteria with more than 73% Escherichia coli. Children and infants (mean age, 32months [range, 1month to 14years]) accounted for 84% of the bacteria collected and newborns (mean age, 12days [range, 1day to 1month]) 16%. A female predominance was observed in the pediatric population (M:F sex ratio, 3.2), whereas for the neonatal population, the proportions were almost identical in both sexes (M:F sex ratio, 1.1). Most of the positive urine cultures (n=1234) were from the community. Hospitalized patients (n=636) were divided into pediatric (60%) and neonatal units (40%). Five bacterial genera dominated the bacteriological profile: E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., and Enterococcus. The susceptibility of the main BUP antibiotics used for treatment of frequent UTI showed the effectiveness of furadoine, imipenem, fosfomycin, and colistin. Amoxicillin kept constant activity against Enterococcus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The rates of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam antibiotics were high, especially in the neonatal population. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was noted in 12.8% of pediatric Enterobacteria vs. 22.6% of the neonatal strains. For community Enterobacteriaceae, the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics was limited with 11.2% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G), including 8.6% ESBL production. CONCLUSION: The impact of widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics in neonatal and pediatric environments is felt. Colistin, imipenem, and fosfomycin are the most frequently used antibiotics active against bacteria responsible for neonatal and pediatric UTI; however, they cannot be used as probabilistic treatment. Nitrofurans seem to be active antibiotics on UTI, but they present limits in their use in neonatal and pediatric populations. Their indication in case of pyelonephritis should be discussed.
TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  - Sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (GTSP) and smooth hound (SHSP) skins. Their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using X-ray diffraction and Infrared spectroscopic analysis. The antibacterial activities of GTSP and SHSP against Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 43251), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enterica (ATCC 43972) and Enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and by essays in liquid media. GTSP and SHSP were fractionated by a Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. Fraction FGII, from GTSP, and fraction FSII, from SHSP, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. The sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. Overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
TI  - Bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in Chinese newborns.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. The present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (VD) or by cesarean section (CD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 VD infants and 16 CD infants. Profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. RESULTS: On days 2 and 4 of postnatal life, VD and CD infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. In VD infants, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides sp, and Bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. In CD infants, Staphylococcus sp, Clostridium sp, Enterobacter sp, and Streptococcus sp were more common. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in Chinese newborn infants. This is in accordance with data reported in other regions.
TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in Olsztyn, Poland. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC22, HPC37), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. Their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6), 3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)CFU/g, respectively. It was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater than those obtained by the cultivation method. Among identified Enterobacteriaceae, Pantoea spp. and Enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas Escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when E. coli were absent. Bacteria from Staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. Additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. Maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)CFU/g. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Trichoderma genera were most numerous among molds, whereas Trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. Sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. Potentially pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when Toxocara and E. coli were absent. It seems that assessing the contamination of children's play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes and may not fully reflect their safety for children.
TI  - Chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) composition of ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi was analyzed by GC-MS. The oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). Seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). The major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). Trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Corynebacterium sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus sp., Nocardia sp. and Streptococcus group D). The essential oil of the ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi has shown to be active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/mL to 56.86 mug/mL. However, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, Gram-positive species showed greater sensitivity to the action of EO, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Generation of Enterobacter sp. YSU auxotrophs using transposon mutagenesis.
AB  - Prototrophic bacteria grow on M-9 minimal salts medium supplemented with glucose  (M-9 medium), which is used as a carbon and energy source. Auxotrophs can be generated using a transposome. The commercially available, Tn5-derived transposome used in this protocol consists of a linear segment of DNA containing an R6Kgamma replication origin, a gene for kanamycin resistance and two mosaic sequence ends, which serve as transposase binding sites. The transposome, provided as a DNA/transposase protein complex, is introduced by electroporation into the prototrophic strain, Enterobacter sp. YSU, and randomly incorporates itself into this host's genome. Transformants are replica plated onto Luria-Bertani agar plates containing kanamycin, (LB-kan) and onto M-9 medium agar plates containing kanamycin (M-9-kan). The transformants that grow on LB-kan plates but not on M-9-kan plates are considered to be auxotrophs. Purified genomic DNA from an auxotroph is partially digested, ligated and transformed into a pir+ Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain. The R6Kgamma replication origin allows the plasmid to replicate in pir+ E. coli strains, and the kanamycin resistance marker allows for plasmid selection. Each transformant possesses a new plasmid containing the transposon flanked by the interrupted chromosomal region. Sanger sequencing and the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) suggest a putative identity of the interrupted gene. There are three advantages to using this transposome mutagenesis strategy. First, it does not rely on the expression of a transposase gene by the host. Second, the transposome is introduced into the target host by electroporation, rather than by conjugation or by transduction and therefore is more efficient. Third, the R6Kgamma replication origin makes it easy to identify the mutated gene which is partially recovered in a recombinant plasmid. This technique can be used to investigate the genes involved in other characteristics of Enterobacter sp. YSU or of a wider variety of bacterial strains.
TI  - Entericidin is required for a probiotic treatment (Enterobacter sp. strain C6-6)  to protect trout from cold-water disease challenge.
AB  - Flavobacterium psychrophilum causes bacterial cold-water disease in multiple fish species, including salmonids. An autochthonous Enterobacter strain (C6-6) inhibits the in vitro growth of F. psychrophilum, and when ingested as a putative probiotic, it provides protection against injection challenge with F. psychrophilum in rainbow trout. In this study, low-molecular-mass (</=3 kDa) fractions from both Enterobacter C6-6 and Escherichia coli K-12 culture supernatants inhibited the growth of F. psychrophilum. The </=3-kDa fraction from Enterobacter C6-6 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and subsequent tandem mass spectroscopy identified EcnB, which is a small membrane lipoprotein that is a putative pore-forming toxin. Agar plate diffusion assays demonstrated that ecnAB knockout strains of both Enterobacter C6-6 and E. coli K-12 no longer inhibited F. psychrophilum (P < 0.001), while ecnAB-complemented knockout strains recovered the inhibitory phenotype (P < 0.001). In fish experiments, the engineered strains (C6-6 DeltaecnAB and C6-6 DeltaecnAB<pET101::ecnAB>) and the wild-type strain (C6-6) were added to the fish diet every day for 38 days. On day 11, the fish were challenged by injection with a virulent strain of F. psychrophilum (CSF 259-93). Fish that were fed C6-6 had significantly longer survival than fish fed the ecnAB knockout strain (P < 0.0001), while fish fed the complemented knockout strain recovered the probiotic phenotype (P = 0.61). This entericidin is responsible for the probiotic activity of Enterobacter C6-6, and it may present new opportunities for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments against similarly susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Rational design of K173A substitution enhances thermostability coupled with catalytic activity of Enterobacter sp. Bn12 lipase.
AB  - ELBn12 is a lipase isolated from Enterobacter sp. Bn12 with potential application in biotechnology. Homology modeling and rational design were applied to improve thermal stability of the lipase. K173A substitution introduced an AXXXA motif on the lipase model and it may have role in dimerization and thermostability of the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to construct the lipase variant. The mutated lipase was expressed in Escherichia coli pLysS and partially purified. Thermostability of the mutated lipase after 1 h of incubation at 70 degrees C was twice that of wild-type lipase under the same conditions. Catalytic activity of the variant was about 1.5-fold towards tricaprylin at 60 degrees C and pH 8.0; moreover, the lipase variant preserved its stability within the pH range of 7.0-11.0. Substitution of superficial hydrophilic Lys with hydrophobic Ala residue increased stability of the mutated lipase in the presence of nonionic surfactants, but this substitution caused lower stability towards polar solvents. Analysis of circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the K173A mutation altered the secondary structure of the lipase into a more helical one. In conclusion, results of this study demonstrate the positive role of generation of a stabilizing protein motif through rational protein engineering that improves the enzyme characteristics.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of newly isolated lipase from Enterobacter sp. Bn12.
AB  - A mesophilic Enterobacter sp. Bn12 producing an alkaline thermostable lipase was  isolated from soil in Tehran, Iran. The lipase gene (ELBn12) was identified from a genomic library. Sequence analysis of the DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame of 879 bp encoding a lipase with a molecular mass of 31.3 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 96% identity with a lipase of Enterobacter sp. Ag1 and the identity of their DNA sequences was 88.9%. ELBn12 belongs to the lipase subfamily I.1 and its catalytic triad consists of Ser82, Asp237 and His259. The lipase was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) pLysS and partially purified by anion exchange chromatography. The maximum activity of ELBn12 was obtained at temperature of 60 degrees C and pH 8.0 towards tricaprylin (C8) and its specific activity was around 2900 U/mg. ELBn12 was stable within a broad pH range from 6.0 to 11.0. The enzyme showed high stability in both polar and nonpolar organic solvents at 50% (v/v). The lipase activity was enhanced in the presence of 10 mM of Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and K(+), while heavy metals (Fe(3+) and Zn(2+)) had strong inhibitory effect. ELBn12 showed high activity in the presence of 1% (w/v) nonionic surfactants, however ionic surfactants inhibited the lipolytic activity. ELBn12 characteristics show that it has a potential to be used in various industrial processes.
TI  - Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.
AB  - Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults. Furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.
TI  - Molecular detection of ESBLs production and antibiotic resistance patterns in Gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: beta-lactam resistance is more prevalent in Gram negative bacterial isolates worldwide, particularly in developing countries. In order to provide data relating to antibiotic therapy and resistance control, routine monitoring of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes is necessary. AIMS: The aim of this study was the characterization of beta-lactam resistance genes and its plasmid profile in bacteria isolated from urinary tract infection samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 298 Gram negative bacteria isolated from 6739 urine specimens were identified by biochemical standard tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains were also detected by the double-disk synergy test. The presence of blaTEM and blaSHV genes in the strains studied was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of all Gram negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (69.1%) was the most common strain, followed by Klebsiella sp. (12.1%), Enterobacter sp. (8.4%), Proteus sp. (4.4%), Citrobacter (4%) and Pseudomonas sp. (2%). The most antibiotic resistance was shown to tetracycline (95.16%), nalidixic acid (89.78%) and gentamycin (73.20%) antibiotics. Among all the strains tested, 35 isolates (11.75%) expressed ESBL activity. The prevalence of TEM and SHV positivity among these isolates was 34.29%, followed by TEM (31.43%), TEM and SHV negativity (20.0%) and SHV (14.29%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Regular monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance seems necessary to improve our guidelines in the use of the empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Freshwater-borne bacteria isolated from a Malaysian rainforest waterfall exhibiting quorum sensing properties.
AB  - One obvious requirement for concerted action by a bacterial population is for an  individual to be aware of and respond to the other individuals of the same species in order to form a response in unison. The term "quorum sensing" (QS) was coined to describe bacterial communication that is able to stimulate expression of a series of genes when the concentration of the signaling molecules has reached a threshold level. Here we report the isolation from aquatic environment of a bacterium that was later identified as Enterobacter sp.. Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Escherichia coli [pSB401] were used for preliminary screening of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) production. The Enterobacter sp. isolated was shown to produce two types of AHLs as confirmed by analysis using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of an Enterobacter sp. that produced both 3-oxo-C6-HSL and 3-oxo-C8-HSL as QS signaling molecules.
TI  - Study of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus strains as probiotics on multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (UTIs).
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by bacteria is one of the most frequent infections in human population. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, often leads to appearance of drug resistance in bacteria. However, use of probiotic bacteria has been suggested as a partial replacement. This study was aimed to assess the antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus standard strains against bacteria isolated from UTI infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 600 samples; those with >/=10,000 cfu/ml were selected as UTI positive samples. Enterococcus sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli were found the most prevalent UTI causative agents. All isolates were screened for multi drug resistance and subjected to the antimicrobial effects of three Lactobacillus strains by using microplate technique and the MICs amounts were determined. In order to verify the origin of antibiotic resistance of isolates, plasmid curing using ethidium bromide and acridine orange was carried out. RESULTS: No antagonistic activity in Lactobacilli suspension was detected against test on Enterococcus and Enterobacter strains and K. pneumoniae, which were resistant to most antibiotics. However, an inhibitory effect was observed for E. coli which were resistant to 8-9 antibiotics. In addition, L. casei was determined to be the most effective probiotic. RESULTS from replica plating suggested one of the plasmids could be related to the gene responsible for ampicillin resistance. CONCLUSION: Treatment of E. coli with probiotic suspension was not effective on inhibition of the plasmid carrying hypothetical ampicillin resistant gene. Moreover, the plasmid profiles obtained from probiotic-treated isolates were identical to untreated isolates.
TI  - Health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  - Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of Brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. We surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the Alberto Lofgren State Park, Sao Paulo, Brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. Hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. All animals were serologically negative for Rickettsia rickettsii, Leishmania spp., and Trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), Leptospira sp. (26%), and Toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. Salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. Frequently cultured enterobacteria included Escherichia coli (61%), Enterococcus casseiflavus (35%), Enterococcus faecalis (35%), Enterobacter aerogenes (32%), Klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and Serratia marcescens (32%). No potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. Fecal parasitology revealed infection by Protozoophaga sp. (58%), Viannella spp. (23%), Strongyloides spp. (10%), and Ancilostomatidae (10%). A total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: Amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), A. dubitatum adults (52%), and A. cajennense adults (5%). The capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of Amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of Rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, Leptospira sp., and Toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.
TI  - De-novo synthesis of 2-phenylethanol by Enterobacter sp. CGMCC 5087.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 2-phenylethanl (2-PE) and its derivatives are important chemicals, which are widely used in food materials and fine chemical industries and polymers and it's also a potentially valuable alcohol for next-generation biofuel. However, the biosynthesis of 2-PE are mainly biotransformed from phenylalanine, the price of which barred the production. Therefore, it is necessary to seek more sustainable technologies for 2-PE production. RESULTS: A new strain which produces 2-PE through the phenylpyruvate pathway was isolated and identified as Enterobacter sp. CGMCC 5087. The strain is able to use renewable monosaccharide as the carbon source and NH4Cl as the nitrogen source to produce 2-PE. Two genes of rate-limiting enzymes, chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase (PheA) and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase (DAHP), were cloned from Escherichia coli and overexpressed in E. sp. CGMCC 5087. The engineered E. sp. CGMCC 5087 produces 334.9 mg L(-)(1) 2-PE in 12 h, which is 3.26 times as high as the wild strain. CONCLUSIONS: The phenylpyruvate pathway and the substrate specificity of 2-keto-acid decarboxylase towards phenylpyruvate were found in E. sp. CGMCC 5087. Combined with the low-cost monosaccharide as the substrate, the finding provides a novel and potential way for 2-PE production.
TI  - Assessment of bacteriological quality of ready to eat food vended in streets of Silchar city, Assam, India.
AB  - A total of 37 street vended food samples were examined for bacterial and the colony forming units counts ranged from 4.5 x 10(5) to 1.12 x 10(6). The isolates were identified as Escherichia coli (37.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.57%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.20%), Salmonella sp. (5.36%), Klebsiella sp. (10.71%), Shigella sp. (19.64%) and Enterobacter sp. (8.93%) respectively. All the 56 isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin while their susceptibility to the other drugs varied. These findings demonstrated that the ready-to-eat foods vended in Silchar city constitute an important potential hazard to human health and provision of health education to the vendors would improve quality of street foods.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections: preventable cause of mortality in spinal cord injury patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an alarming rate of morbidity and mortality observed in the  trauma victims who suffer spinal cord injuries (SCI). Such patients are admitted immediately and stay for longer periods of time and thus are at risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. AIMS: The aim of this study is to analyze the primary cause of mortality in SCI patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 4 year analysis of the postmortem data of 341 patients who died after sustaining SCI at a tertiary care apex trauma center of India. Epidemiological data of patients including the type of trauma, duration of hospital stay, cause of death and microbiological data were recorded. RESULTS: On autopsy, out of 341 patients, the main cause of death in the SCI patients was ascertained to be infection/septicemia in 180 (52.7%) patients, the rest 161 (47.2%) died due to severe primary injury. Respiratory tract infections (36.4%) were predominant followed by urinary tract infections (32.2%), blood stream infections (22.2%), wound infections (7.1%) and meningitis reported in only 5 (2.1%) cases. Acinetobacter sp (40%) was the predominant organism isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp (16.3%), Klebsiella sp (15.1%), Candida sp (7.8%), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.9%), Proteus sp (3.3%), Enterobacter sp and Burkholderia sp (two cases each) and Stenotrophomonas sp (one case). A high level of multidrug resistance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are leading cause of loss of young lives in trauma patients; hence efforts should be made to prevent HAIs.
TI  - Are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in Brooklyn, NY. As a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. Screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR method. RESULTS: Of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. Cephalosporin-resistant Citrobacter freundii (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 2), and Enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not from control sites. One isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated VIM-2. Acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6 miles (P = .004). Eleven A baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR and were also related to a known clinical isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of A baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. Finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. The finding of integron-associated VIM-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further vigilance is warranted.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated Pectobacterium species.
AB  - Fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. These microorganisms included one Dickeya zeae isolate and 7 Enterobacter, 3 Pantoea, and 43 Pectobacterium species. Eleven out of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. Among those, Pectobacterium carotovorum KKH 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. In this strain, the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (SIase) production. The SIase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 U/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 U/mg dcw at 0% sucrose). The gene encoding SIase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from P. carotovorum KKH 3-1 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant SIase (PCSI) was shown to have optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C. The reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by PCSI. The amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees C to 30 degrees C, implying that SIase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against Gram-negative organisms collected from U.S. medical centers in 2012.
AB  - The activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli. Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits Ambler class A, C, and some D enzymes. A total of 10,928 Gram-negative bacilli-8,640 Enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 Acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 U.S. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA, USA). Ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. Overall, 99.8% of Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC>/=2 mug/ml) K. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae. Among ESBL-phenotype K. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=8 mug/ml, and susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. Ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa (MIC50/MIC90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). Acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam MIC50/MIC90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. In summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated potent activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in U.S. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Brazil.
AB  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in chromosomal gyrA and parC genes and fluoroquinolone susceptibility profiles were investigated in quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from community and hospitalized patients in the Brazilian Southeast region. A total of 112 nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacterial isolates collected from 2000 to 2005 were investigated for mutations in the topoisomerases genes gyrA and parC by amplifying and sequencing the QRDR regions. Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was tested by the agar dilution method. Amongst the 112 enterobacterial isolates, 81 (72.3%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 5 (4.5%) showed reduced susceptibility. Twenty-six (23.2%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Several alterations were detected in gyrA and parC genes. Escherichia coli isolates (47.7%) showed double mutations in the gyrA gene and a single one in the parC gene. Two unusual aminoacid substitutions are reported, an Asp87-Asn in a Citrobacter freundii isolate with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and a Glu84-Ala in one E. coli isolate. Only a parC gene mutation was found in fluoroquinolone-susceptible Enterobacter aerogenes. None of the isolates susceptible to ciprofloxacin presented mutations in topoisomerase genes. This comprehensive analysis of QRDRs in gyrA and parC genes, covering commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae in Brazil is the largest reported up to now.
TI  - [Opportunistic bacteria and microbial flora in children with leukemia and neutropenic enterocolitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to determine the prevalence of opportunistic microorganisms and microbial flora in neutropenic enterocolitis in oncohematological pediatric patients. METHODS: a prospective and observational study was done. Patients with diagnosis of acute leukemia and neutropenia were included. Stool cultures were taken to identify microorganisms and microbial flora. A chi(2) test with Yates corrections and Fisher exact test were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: 21 patients were included (12 male, 57.1 %). The stool cultures showed that 68 % of microorganisms were Gram-negative. The presence of microorganisms Gram-positive was 20 %, 6 % for Candida sp.; 3 % for Cryptosporidium sp.; and in 3 % were acid fast bacilli. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli were presented in pure culture. No association was found between Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms with age, white cell count or pure or mixed cultures. CONCLUSIONS: although Gram-negative microorganisms were the most frequent, Gram-positive and other microorganisms that are not detected habitually in feces culture were isolated.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - Emergence of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) producing and multidrug resistant uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in Andaman Islands, India.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to understand the distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens in the remote islands of India. Patients' demographical data, urine culture results, and resistance rates were analyzed and multidrug resistant isolates were characterized. Significant bacteriuria was found in 16 (17.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.47-23.53%) samples, which includes Escherichia coli 9 (56.3%); Klebsiella pneumoniae 3 (18.8%); Enterobacter sp. 2 (12.5%) and Proteus mirabilis 2 (12.5%). The uropathogens showed a wide resistance involving 3-21 drugs with 15 different resistance patterns. Among the 16 isolates, 13 (81.3%, 95% CI 62.13-100.37%) and 11 (68.8%, 95% CI 46.04-91.46%) isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins, respectively. Multiple mutations were detected in quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and all third generation cephalosporin resistant isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A total of 7 (44%, 95% CI 17.02-70.98%) isolates was found to harbor plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants The present study reports for the first time the presence of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) gene in two isolates of P. mirabilis in these islands. Detection of multidrug resistant and NDM-1 producing isolates from cases of urinary tract infection in these remote islands lends support to the belief that the existence of these highly resistant strains is perhaps more widespread than previously thought and underscores the need for immediate implementation of antibiotic policy integrated with a continuous surveillance system. The study strengthens the need for a continuous surveillance system of antibiotic resistance in these remote Islands.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a GH43 beta-xylosidase from Enterobacter sp. identified and cloned from forest soil bacteria.
AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass for second generation biofuels requires optimization of enzymatic breakdown of plant cell walls. In this work, cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from a native and two cultivated forest soil samples. Amplification of glycosyl hydrolases was attempted by using a low stringency-degenerate primer PCR strategy, using total soil DNA and bulk DNA pooled from positive colonies as template. A set of primers was designed based on Acidothermus cellulolyticus genome, by search of conserved domains of glycosyl hydrolases (GH) families of interest. Using this approach, a fragment containing an open reading frame (ORF) with 98% identity to a putative GH43 beta-xylosidase coding gene from Enterobacter cloacae was amplified and cloned. The full protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal or C-terminal His-tagged fusions and purified under native conditions. Only N-terminal fusion protein, His-Xyl43, presented beta-xylosidase activity. On pNPX, optimal activity was achieved at pH 6 and 40 degrees C and Km and Kcat values were 2.92 mM and 1.32 seg(-1), respectively. Activity was also demonstrated on xylobiose (X2), with Km 17.8 mM and Kcat 380 s(-1). These results demonstrated that Xyl43 is a functional beta-xylosidase and it is the first evidence of this activity for Enterobacter sp.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Enterobacterial detection and Escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance in parrots seized from the illegal wildlife trade.
AB  - Enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the Escherichia coli isolates cultured. Fecal samples were collected from 300 parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in Goias, Brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. A total of 508 isolates were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 E. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 Enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 Klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 Citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 Proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 Providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 Serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 Hafnia aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 Salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). Escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). Multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. These results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli strains with antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - New pyran-2-ones from alkalophilic actinomycete, Nocardiopsis alkaliphila sp. Nov. YIM-80379.
AB  - Two new pyran-2-ones, nocardiopyrones A and B (1 and 2, resp.), along with four known compounds, pyridinols 3-5, and 1-acetyl-beta-carboline (6) were isolated from the alkalophilic actinomycete Nocardiopsis alkaliphila sp. nov. YIM-80379. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, CD spectra, and the quantum-chemical ECD calculation. Pyridinols 3-5 were isolated from a natural source for the first time. Compounds 1 and 2 showed weak antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli with MIC values of 20-48 muM. Compound 2 showed weak antimicrobial activities against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 24 and 48 muM, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of a heavy metal translocating P-type ATPase gene from an environmental heavy metal resistance Enterobacter sp. isolate.
AB  - Heavy metals are common contaminants found in polluted areas. We have identified  a heavy metal translocating P-type ATPase gene (hmtp) via fosmid library and in vitro transposon mutagenesis from an Enterobacter sp. isolate. This gene is believed to participate in the bacterium's heavy metal resistance traits. The complete gene was identified, cloned, and expressed in a suitable Escherichia coli host cell. E. coli W3110, RW3110 (zntA::Km), GG48 (DeltazitB::Cm zntA::Km), and GG51 (DeltazitB::Cm) were used to study the possible effects of this gene for heavy metal (cadmium and zinc in particular) resistance. Among the E. coli strains tested, RW3110 and GG48 showed more sensitivity to cadmium and zinc compared to the wild-type E. coli W3110 and strain GG51. Therefore, strains RW3110 and GG48 were chosen for the reference hosts for further evaluation of the gene's effect. The results showed that expression of this heavy metal translocating P-type ATPase gene could increase the ability for zinc and cadmium resistance in the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - Biochemical basis of mercury remediation and bioaccumulation by Enterobacter sp.  EMB21.
AB  - The aims of this study were to isolate metal bioaccumulating bacterial strains and to study their applications in removal of environmental problematic heavy metals like mercury. Five bacterial strains belonging to genera Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas were isolated from oil-spilled soil. Among these, one of the strains Enterobacter sp. EMB21 showed mercury bioaccumulation inside the cells simultaneous to its bioremediation. The bioaccumulation of remediated mercury was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray. The mercury-resistant loci in the Enterobacter sp. EMB21 cells were plasmid-mediated as confirmed by transformation of mercury-sensitive Escherichia coli DH5alpha by Enterobacter sp. EMB21 plasmid. Effect of different culture parameters viz-a-viz inoculum size, pH, carbon, and nitrogen source revealed that alkaline pH and presence of dextrose and yeast extract favored better remediation. The results indicated the usefulness of Enterobacter sp. EMB21 for the effective remediation of mercury in bioaccumulated form. The Enterobacter sp. EMB21 seems promising for heavy metal remediation wherein the remediated metal can be trapped inside the cells. The process can further be developed for the synthesis of valuable high-end functional alloy, nanoparticles, or metal conjugates from the metal being remediated.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - In vivo-validated essential genes identified in Acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  - A critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. For bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media. This study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. Mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. A subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. The putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, DNA/RNA synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. These A. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other Gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the Database of Essential Genes (DEG), including those of Acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. However, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. None of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of FDA-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. IMPORTANCE: The human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. This scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective against antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Escherichia coli. This study identified a set of A. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. Furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the Database of Essential Genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. Lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria has been identified.
TI  - Nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the CFU.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  CFU observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (SP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the inconsistent results, CFU estimations were undertaken through conventional SP using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. The latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (SS)] yielded higher CFU by 11-120% over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. The adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus pumilus. Plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. Plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% CFU owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. On the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the CFU significantly. Spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while Bacillus spores were less affected. CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out that the way SP is carried out exerts significant effects on CFU influenced by plate conditions. Prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. A mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of SS not involving the spreader is recommended. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial cells and the CFU and recommends an alternate approach of SS to minimize CFU inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - Broad diversity of conjugative plasmids in integron-carrying bacteria from wastewater environments.
AB  - In this study we assessed the occurrence, diversity and conjugative potential of  plasmids in integron-carrying Aeromonas and Enterobacteriaceae from wastewaters. Sixty-six strains were included as donors in mating assays using rifampicin-resistant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida recipient strains. The diversity of plasmids from donors and transconjugants (resistant to tetracycline or streptomycin) was evaluated by restriction analysis and replicon typing targeting 19 incompatibility groups. Restriction patterns revealed a diverse plasmid pool present in these strains. Plasmids were assigned to FrepB (Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas sp., E. coli, Enterobacter sp.), FIC (A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp.), FIA (Shigella sp.), I1 (A. veronii, Aeromonas sp., E. coli), HI1 (E. coli) and U (Aeromonas media) replicons. Nevertheless, 50% of the plasmids could not be assigned to any replicon type. Among integron-positive transconjugants, FrepB, I1 and HI1 replicons were detected. Results showed that wastewaters enclose a rich plasmid pool associated with integron-carrying bacteria, capable of conjugating to different bacterial hosts. Moreover, replicons detected in this study in Aeromonas strains expand our current knowledge of plasmid diversity in this genus.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of 6,296 Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates collected at a tertiary care university hospital in Greece.
AB  - The reevaluation of "forgotten" antibiotics can identify new therapeutic options  against extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We sought to investigate isepamicin in this regard. We retrospectively evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility to isepamicin of Enterobacteriaceae sp. isolates from unique patients, collected at the microbiological laboratory of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, from 2004 to 2009. Susceptibility testing was done with the automated Vitek 2 system. The breakpoints for susceptibility to isepamicin, tigecycline, and other antibiotics were those proposed by the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM), the FDA, and the CLSI, respectively. A total of 6,296 isolates were studied, including primarily 3,401 (54.0%) Escherichia coli, 1,040 (16.5%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 590 (9.4%) Proteus mirabilis, and 460 (7.3%) Enterobacter sp. isolates. Excluding the species with intrinsic resistance to each antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility was highest for colistin (5,275/5,441 isolates [96.9%]) and isepamicin (6,103/6,296 [96.9%]), followed by meropenem (5,890/6,296 [93.6%]), imipenem (5,874/6,296 [93.3%]), and amikacin (5,492/6,296 [87.2%]). The antimicrobial susceptibility of the 1,040 K. pneumoniae isolates was highest for isepamicin (95.3%), followed by colistin (89.3%) and meropenem (63.0%). Regarding resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to isepamicin was observed for 91.1% of the 392, 87.7% of the 375, and 85.6% of the 111 isolates that were nonsusceptible to the carbapenems, all other aminoglycosides, and colistin, respectively. Isepamicin exhibited high in vitro activity against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae species. It could particularly serve as a last-resort therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in our region, where it is endemic, as it does not show considerable cross-resistance with other aminoglycosides.
TI  - Coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in Jiaozhou Bay, China.
AB  - Diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of Jiaozhou Bay, China. Five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by PCR amplification, including qnrA3 gene in a Shewanella algae isolate, qnrB9 gene in a Citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrD gene in 22 Proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrS1 gene in 1 Enterobacter sp. and 4 Klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrS2 gene in 1 Pseudomonas sp. and 4 Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. The qnrC, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA genes could not be detected in this study. The 22 qnrD-positive Proteus vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on ERIC-PCR assay. The qnrS1 and qnrD genes could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53 Azi(R) or E. coli TOP10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. Among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the QRDRs of GyrA protein (Ala67Ser, Ser83Ile, or Ser83Thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. Eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(CMY), bla(OXY), bla(SHV), and bla(TEM) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrB9 or qnrS1 gene. Our current study is the first identification of qnrS2 gene in Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas strains, and qnrD gene in Proteus vulgaris strains. High prevalence of diverse qnr genes in Jiaozhou Bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiont marine Enterobacter sp at Kavaratti Island, Lakshadweep archipelago.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiotic bacteria from marine sponges at Lakshadweep archipelago. Also to identify the potent bacteria by 16s rDNA sequencing and determine the antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens by MIC.

CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  - The presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in Mexico. Results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. Susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (Cr(R)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (Hg(R)). Cr(R) levels were high in Klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in Enterobacter cloacae (12%) and Escherichia coli (4%), and null in Salmonella sp. isolates. Colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chrA gene (87% of Cr(R) isolates), encoding a CHR transporter homologue, and merA gene (74% of Hg(R) isolates), encoding MerA mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. Southern blot hybridization of Cr(R) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from K. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an E. cloacae isolate, contained chrA-related sequences. These plasmids belonged to IncN or IncP incompatibility groups, and conferred Cr(R), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an E. coli standard strain. These data indicated that Cr(R) genes may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Microbiological quality of drinking water from dispensers in roadside restaurants of Bangladesh.
AB  - The microbiological status of water from dispensers in different roadside restaurants of Dhaka city and Savar area was analyzed in this study. Seven samples from Dhaka and 8 samples of Savar were checked. The heterotrophic plate count was in a range of 1.0 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1) to 2.0 x 10(4) CFU mL(-1) (from new bottles), 1.0 x 10(3) to 1.5 x 10(4) CFU mL(-1) (after dispensation), and 1.5 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1) to 1.0 x l0(5) CFU mL(-1) (from serving glass). In several of the samples, the heterotrophic plate count was higher than the count in water from new bottle or after dispensation, suggesting added contamination from the serving glass. 80% of the samples were contaminated with total and fecal coliform bacteria, which render these waters unacceptable for human consumption. The samples were found to contain gram negative bacteria like E coli, Shigella sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Salmonella sp., which are potential pathogens and thus pose a serious threat to public health. This study elucidates the importance of monitoring the bottling companies and the restaurants and put them under strict regulations to prevent future outbreak of any water borne diseases caused by consumption of dispensed water.
TI  - Rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL-PE) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - Isomaltulose production via yeast surface display of sucrose isomerase from Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 on Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The gene encoding sucrose isomerase from Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 species (ESI) was displayed on the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 using a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attachment signal sequence. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the localization of ESI on the yeast cell surface. The displayed ESI (dESI) was stable at a broad range of temperatures (35-55 degrees C) and pHs (pH 5-7) with optimal temperature and pH at 45 degrees C and pH 7.0, respectively. In addition, the thermostability of the dESI was significantly enhanced compared with the recombinant ESI expressed in Escherichia coli. Biotransformation of sucrose to isomaltulose was observed in various ranges of substrate concentrations (50-250 mM) with a 6.4-7.4% conversion yield. It suggested that the bioconversion of sucrose to isomaltulose can be successfully performed by the dESI on the surface of host S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Physicochemical and microbiological assessment of recreational and drinking waters.
AB  - The present study was aimed to make an assessment of health risk due to pollution and human pathogenic bacteria associated with the recreational and drinking water sources in twin densely populated holy Indian cities Ayodhya and Faizabad. Though physicochemical studies revealed that the water available in the area is under recommended limits for human use, it is unsafe on account of poor microbiological quality of surface and ground water in the region. The most probable number (MPN) test results revealed the preponderance of >/=2,400 total coliforms (TC) (100 ml)(-1) in river, pond, dug well and kund waters. Contrary to that, 94% tube wells, 32% hand pumps and 25% piped supply water were under safe limits having <3 TC (100 ml)(-1). The shallow depth (~40 ft), water logging and presence of septic tanks in the near vicinity are the possible reasons of poor microbial quality of hand pump drinking water. The municipal supply water passes along sewage line where loose connections and/or cracks in pipe lead to mixing and contamination. The significant best quality of tube well water evident from the absence of TC could be attributed to the depth of well >/=150 ft and usually their location away from the habitation. A total of 263 bacteria from 186 water samples were isolated, and at least five genera of enteric bacteria from various water sources were identified morphologically and biochemically as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Shigella sp. and Salmonella sp. The serotyping of 72 E. coli and 36 Salmonella sp. revealed 51 as E. coli O157 and 20 as Salmonella sp. The presence of enteric pathogens in water sources pose threat to human health and therefore call for immediate remedial measures.
TI  - The microbial content of unexpired pasteurized milk from selected supermarkets in a developing country.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence and levels of microbes in unexpired pasteurized milk from randomly selected supermarkets in Kingston, Jamaica. METHODS: The quantitative study used a stratified random sampling technique in the selection of the 20 representative milk samples from six (6) supermarkets. Microbiological tests such as methylene blue reduction, standard plate count (SPC), coliform plate count (CPC), purity plate culture, gram staining and biochemical tests were performed to examine the microbes in purchased unexpired pasteurized milk. RESULTS: One sample (BCr016) had a pH of 4.0, a rancid odour and curdled appearance. It decolourized within one hour during the methylene blue reduction test and was classified as class 4 milk. Seven of the samples were sterile with no microbe growth on the plate count agar and violet red bile salt agar (VRBA). The milk samples that appeared to be safe for consumption were all 10, 11, 12 and 13 days before expiration. The VRBA sample BCr016, had a colony count of 13 400 CFU/ mL. There was the presence of Escherichia coli in sample LCr021 which had a standard plate count of 1 580 SPC/mL and a coliform count of 500 CFU/mL. Enterobacter sp. was present in colonies from BCr016 and all the other milk samples. CONCLUSIONS: Unacceptable levels of Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli were found in most of the samples. Effective measures to ensure safe milk for human consumption such as the phosphatase test and methylene blue reduction test should be routinely performed on each batch of milk processed by dairy plants.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Analysis of the DNA region mediating increased thermotolerance at 58 degrees C in Cronobacter sp. and other enterobacterial strains.
AB  - Cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens associated with serious infections in neonates. The increased stress tolerance, including thermoresistance, of some Cronobacter strains can promote their survival in production facilities and thus raise the possibility of contamination of dried infant milk formula, which has been identified as a potential source of infection. In this study, we characterized a DNA region which is present in some Cronobacter strains and which contributes to their prolonged survival at 58 degrees C. The 18 kbp long region containing 22 open reading frames was sequenced in Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC 29544. The major feature of the region contained a cluster of conserved genes, most of them having significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation and acid stress. The same thermoresistance DNA region was detected in strains belonging to the genera Cronobacter, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia and its presence positively correlated with increased thermotolerance.
TI  - Bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in Nigeria. A better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. This study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in Nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. Antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. METHODOLOGY: A total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria, between February and September 2010. Specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. Susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid DNA extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. Conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant Escherichia coli DH5alpha as the recipient cell. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: All the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. Gram-positive cocci comprising Staphylococcus aureus (27.7%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by Gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and Gram-negative cocci (4.5%). Corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated Gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli. Other Gram-negative bacilli in order of their isolations were E. coli (6.5%), Proteus sp. (3.2%), Klebsiella sp. (1.9%), and Enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). Moraxella spp. were the only Gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. Further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. The disparity in the percentage contribution of three infection patterns was significant (P < 0.05). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. On the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was P. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while Moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to 100%. Other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. A total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which 45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. Conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. The antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor strains. The antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of R plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. The frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or R plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. CONCLUSION: Conjunctivitis as an eye problem in Lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable R plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. Continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology, drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.
TI  - [Incidence and characteristics of bronchial colonisation in patient with lung cancer: a retrospective study of 388 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bronchial colonisation is frequently reported in patients with lung cancer. These colonisations could influence patient therapeutic management and prognosis. The aim of our study is refine incidence and nature of bronchial colonisations in patients presenting with lung cancer. METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-eight patients with lung cancer underwent a flexible bronchoscopy at the time of diagnosis. Among them, 216 patients had a bacteriological, mycobacteriological and fungal investigation. Type and frequency of these colonisations were analyzed. RESULTS: Potential pathogens were found in 39.8% of samples, including mainly 39.8% of Gram-negative bacilli (Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli). In addition, we found 0.9% of mycobacteria and 13.9% of Candida albicans. Among these 216 patients where microbiological analysis was performed, patient features and tumor stage were not significantly correlated to microbial colonisation. CONCLUSIONS: Colonisation of airways is frequently reported when a lung cancer is diagnosed. Our data suggest that bronchial colonisation should be prospectively collected due to its potential interest in the management of lung cancer patients.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of razupenem (PZ601) studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection.
AB  - Simulations of administration of razupenem at 1 g every 12 h by 1-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion were performed in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. The antibacterial effect of this razupenem dosing regimen against six strains of Staphylococcus aureus (one methicillin-sensitive S. aureus [MSSA] strain [MIC, 0.015 mug/ml] and five methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] strains [MIC range, 0.09 to 3 mug/ml]) and five strains of Enterobacteriaceae (three Escherichia coli strains [two containing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases {ESBLs}] and two Enterobacter sp. strains [one with an AmpC enzyme and the other with a raised razupenem MIC; MIC range, 0.09 to 6 mug/ml]) was assessed. Against the MSSA and MRSA strains, razupenem produced a >3.5-log-unit reduction in viable count after 24 h. There were no changes in population profiles. In a second series of experiments, over 5 days there was rapid initial clearance of MRSA from the model followed by regrowth after 48 h. MRSA colonies appeared on 2x MIC recovery medium after 72 h with strain 33820 (MIC, 3.0 mug/ml) and at 120 h with strain 27706 (MIC, 1.5 mug/ml). Against E. coli and Enterobacter spp., razupenem produced a >3.5-log-unit reduction in bacterial counts for all strains except that with an MIC of 6 mug/ml, where razupenem had a notably poorer antibacterial effect. Population profiles were unchanged after 48 h of exposure to razupenem except for Enterobacter strain 34425 (MIC, 6.0 mug/ml), where colonies were recovered from media containing 2x, 4x, and 8x MIC. In dose-ranging studies with MRSA strains, the percentage of the dosing interval that the free drug concentration remained higher than the pathogen MIC (fT>MIC) for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect was 5.0% +/- 1.4%, and that for a 1-log-unit reduction in count was 12.5% +/- 5.8%. Population profiles indicated growth on 2x MIC recovery medium at fT>MIC values of 1 to 35% but not at a value of >35%. In a similar set of experiments with Enterobacteriaceae, the fT>MIC for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect was 34.2% +/- 7.6% and that for a 1-log-unit reduction in count was 42.5% +/- 7.8%. Population analysis profiles indicated growth on recovery media with 2x, 4x, and 8x MIC at fT>MICs in the range of 1 to 69% but rarely at values of >/= 70%. In conclusion, razupenem at simulated human doses of 1 g i.v. every 12 h has a marked antibacterial effect on MSSA and MRSA strains with MICs of </= 3.0 mug/ml and Enterobacteriaceae with MICs of </= 0.4 mug/ml. fT>MIC targets of >/= 35% for MRSA and >/= 70% for Enterobacteriaceae should provide significant antibacterial effects combined with low risks of changing pathogen antibiotic population profiles.
TI  - The antimicrobial activities of processed Nigerian and South African black tea.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of processed Nigerian Lipton Tea and South African 5 Roses Tea, extracted using distilled water, chloroform and 70% ethanol were determined against nine (9) enteropathogenic bacteria which includes; Bacillus subtilis, Proteus sp, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella arizona and Staphylococcus aureus. The 2 tea bags, Nigerian Lipton tea bag and the South African 5 Roses tea bag were extracted through Solvent extraction method using 3 extraction solvents; Distilled water, Chloroform and 70% Ethanol and then inoculated onto the Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing the standard isolates at 6 different points on each plate. The zones of inhibition of the bacterial isolates produced by each of these tea - extracts were determined while meaningful antibacterial activities against five (5) of the standard isolates; Enterobacter sp., K. pneumoniae, S. paratyphi A, B. subtilis and S. aureus were observed. Lipton tea water-extract was a more effective antibacterial agent than water-extract of 5 Roses tea. While the 70% ethanol-extract of 5 Roses tea had the greatest antibacterial activity of all the different tea-extract used for the study, the chloroform-extracts of the tea bags had no antimicrobial effect on all the test organisms used.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and overexpression in Escherichia coli of the Enterobacter sp. Px6-4 gene for ferulic acid decarboxylase.
AB  - Ferulic acid decarboxylase (FADase) can catalyze the transformation of ferulic acid into 4-vinyl guaiacol via decarboxylation in microorganisms. In this study, a gene encoding FADase was first isolated from the bacterium Enterobacter sp. Px6-4 using degenerate primers and a genome walking technique. The putative encoding gene (fad) of FADase consists of 507-bp nucleotides, coding a polypeptide of 168 amino acid residues. In addition, a putative gene encoding the transcriptional regulator was identified from the upstream of the fad gene. The deduced peptide sequence of the FADase from Enterobacter sp. Px6-4 showed a 51.2-53.3% sequence identity to decarboxylases from other bacteria. The gene fad was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and the recombinant FADase was purified as a protein of ca. 23 kDa with an optimal activity at pH 4.0 and 28 degrees C. The purified FADase could convert ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol effectively, and its hydrolytic activity could be inhibited by Cu(2+) (99%) and Hg(2+) (99.5%). A phylogenetic analysis of the FADase protein from bacteria revealed several different clades. Our result provided a basis for further studies of the ferulic acid transformation pathway and for enhanced production of vanillin in the future.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Risk factors for hospital-acquired urinary tract infection: a case-control study.
AB  - The objective is to assess risk factors and microbiological aspects of hospital-acquired urinary tract infection (HAUTI) on six wards of a general regional hospital in Serbia. A case-control study was nested within prospective cohort HAUTIs study conducted from January 1 to December 31, 2007. Three controls were identified for each patient with HAUTI, being chronologically the next three patients surveyed who did not develop HAUTI. The patients and controls were matched by sex and age (+/-5 years). Assessment of 8,467 patients during the study period revealed HAUTI in 125 (116 symptomatic and 9 asymptomatic). The overall incidence rate of HAUTI was 14.8 cases/1,000 admissions. The mean age (range) of cases and controls was 64.9 (18-85) and 65.2 (17-86), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that duration of catheterization >5 days (OR = 51.91; 95% CI = 23.46-114.82) and the ASA score (OR = 13.42; 95% CI = 2.14-84.30) were independently associated with increased risk of HAUTIs. The most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria were Enterobacter, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Enterococcus sp. was the most frequent Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Control of coliform bacteria detected from diarrhea associated patients by extracts of Moringa oleifera.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the total population of coliform bacteria in the samples collected from diarrhea associated patients from the local area of Bangladesh and to examine the antibacterial efficacy of leaf extracts of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) against the isolated coliform bacteria. The coliform bacteria detected in these samples by some microbial-biochemical tests such as Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. The total isolation rate of coliform bacterial species was ranged from 38.01-3.51%. At the concentration of 300 ig/disc, the organic extracts of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Moringa oleifera leaf exhibited a remarkable antibacterial effect against all the tested bacterial pathogens. The zones of inhibition against all the tested bacterial pathogens were found in the range of 8.0 to 23.2 mm, along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 62.5-1000 ig/mL. The results obtained in this study suggest that the extracts from Moringa oleifera leaf can be a source of natural antimicrobials with potential applications in pharmaceutical industry to control coliform bacteria.
TI  - Isolation, structure determination and antibacterial activities of succinamide conjugate diacid from Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L.
AB  - Strain BJ-L was isolated from the a water sample taken from Xiao Yue River in Beijing and identified as Acinetobacter sp. BJ-L based on the study of its morphology, physiology, biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. A new antimicrobial substance was produced after the strain was incubated in potato extract medium at 15 degrees C for 72 h. The antimicrobial substance was sequentially purified by reduced pressure condensation, EtOAc extract, and silica gel column chromatography. The structure of the antimicrobial substance was elucidated as succinamide conjugate diacid (SCD) by spectroscopic data interpretation. Structure analysis indicated that SCD is a novel compound and that it could inhibit the growth of some tested bacterial strains with the MIC of 2mg/ml, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Moreover, no obvious toxicity has been found on cultured HUVEC cells with different concentrations of SCD at 5, 10, 15, and 20mg/ml.
TI  - Culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  - Culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a German dairy company and a Spanish dry cured ham company. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. Autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised DGGE DNA bands. More specifically, real-time PCR was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella spp, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to the detection limits of the real-time PCR method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. Autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. Only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the German dairy company. Enterococci and P.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. Some opportunistic bacteria as Enterobacter sp., Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic Bacillus, were also detected after DNA sequencing of DGGE bands.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of Rose Bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers Rose Bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (LED) on Enterobacteriaceae. Twelve Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three Escherichia coli, three Enterobacter cloacae, three Klebsiella oxytoca and three Klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. An Enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: LED and Rose Bengal, LED and erythrosin, LED and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. A blue LED unit (460 nm), and Rose Bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal. There was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for Enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for Escherichia coli, 6.76 log10 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for Klebsiella oxytoca. However, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of CFUs per milliliter compared to the control group. The use of the LED alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. The Enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal.
TI  - Reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Duganella sp. B2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  - Violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and antifungal activities. However, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. In order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of Duganella sp. B2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. The gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from Duganella sp. B2, and three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the T7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter PalkB. Our results showed that violacein could be stably synthesized in E. coli, C. freundii, and E. aerogenes. Interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. Among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant C. freundii strain reached 1.68 g L(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Proteomic profiling of L-cysteine induced selenite resistance in Enterobacter sp. YSU.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacter sp. YSU is resistant to several different heavy metal salts, including selenite. A previous study using M-9 minimal medium showed that when the selenite concentration was 100,000 times higher than the sulfate concentration, selenite entered Escherichia coli cells using two pathways: a specific and a non-specific pathway. In the specific pathway, selenite entered the cells through a yet to be characterized channel dedicated for selenite. In the non-specific pathway, selenite entered the cells through a sulfate permease channel. Addition of L-cystine, an L-cysteine dimer, appeared to indirectly decrease selenite import into the cell through the non-specific pathway. However, it did not affect the level of selenite transport into the cell through the specific pathway. RESULTS: Growth curves using M-9 minimal medium containing 40 mM selenite and 1 mM sulfate showed that Enterobacter sp. YSU grew when L-cysteine was present but died when it was absent. Differential protein expression analysis by two dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that CysK was present in cultures containing selenite and lacking L-cysteine but absent in cultures containing both selenite and L-cysteine. Additional RT-PCR studies demonstrated that transcripts for the sulfate permease genes, cysA, cysT and cysW, were down-regulated in the presence of L-cysteine. CONCLUSION: L-cysteine appeared to confer selenite resistance upon Enterobacter sp. YSU by decreasing the level of selenite transport into the cell through the non-specific pathway.
TI  - Comparison of two multimetal resistant bacterial strains: Enterobacter sp. YSU and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ORO2.
AB  - The Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge, TN, which manufactured nuclear weapons during World  War II and the Cold War, contaminated East Fork Poplar Creek with heavy metals. The multimetal resistant bacterial strain, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Oak Ridge strain O2 (S. maltophilia O2), was isolated from East Fork Poplar Creek. Sequence analysis of 16s rDNA suggested that our working strain of S. maltophilia O2 was a strain of Enterobacter. Phylogenetic tree analysis and biochemical tests confirmed that it belonged to an Enterobacter species. This new strain was named Enterobacter sp. YSU. Using a modified R3A growth medium, R3A-Tris, the Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Au(III), Cr(VI), Ag(I), As(III), and Se(IV) MICs for a confirmed strain of S. maltophilia O2 were 0.24, 0.33, 5, 5, 0.25, 7, 0.03, 14, and 40 mM, respectively, compared to 0.07, 0.24, 0.8, 3, 0.05, 0.4, 0.08, 14, and 40 mM, respectively, for Enterobacter sp. YSU. Although S. maltophilia O2 was generally more metal resistant than Enterobacter sp. YSU, in comparison to Escherichia coli strain HB101, Enterobacter sp. YSU was resistant to Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Au(III), Ag(I), As(III), and Se(IV). By studying metal resistances in these two strains, it may be possible to understand what makes one microorganism more metal resistant than another microorganism. This work also provided benchmark MICs that can be used to evaluate the metal resistance properties of other bacterial isolates from East Fork Poplar Creek and other metal contaminated sites.
TI  - Growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: Effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  - Simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU) linked with ChemPro100i((R)) gas detector. The effects of vancomycin were evaluated in aerobic cultures. Growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, pH alterations, and colony counts on BD CHROMagar Orientation plates. Results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli E 17 and Klebsiella mobilis ATCC 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus. When the evaporations of the mixed cultures of E. coli, K. mobilis and S. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by ChemPro100i((R)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant E. coli and K. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. A survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big University Hospital, (Salzburg, Austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. Only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). Enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). In anaerobiosis it was shown that Klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the E. coli. The ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in the gas stream of the PMEU culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. The synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter strains is suggested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, and Hera Hospital in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2005 to March 2006. A total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. Demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. RESULTS: The most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Klebsiella sp. (6.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), Proteus sp. (3.3%), and Enterobacter sp. (1.9%). Results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. The implementation of monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.
TI  - Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a sucrose isomerase (isomaltulose synthase) gene from Enterobacter sp. FMB-1.
AB  - AIMS: Isomaltulose (palatinose) is a slowly digestible sucrose isomer that can reduce both the glycemic and insulinemic response to foods. The aim of this study was to clone and express a sucrose isomerase (SIase) gene and characterize the protein that is responsible for the production of isomaltulose in the micro-organism Enterobacter sp. FMB-1. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cosmid clone containing c. 6 kbp region encoding an SIase gene was identified. The 5969-bp chromosomal DNA fragment covering the SIase (esi) gene in Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 was sequenced. Although this DNA fragment contained several open reading frames other than esi, only the presence of esi was sufficient to produce isomaltulose in recombinant Escherichia coli. The esi gene was expressed in E. coli, leading to the characterization of its SIase activity. CONCLUSIONS: The Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 esi gene was successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli. This gene encoded a functional SIase that produced isomaltulose from sucrose. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first molecular analysis of an SIase gene in an Enterobacter strain. The functional expression of the Enterobacter sp. FMB-1 esi gene in E. coli offers an alternative choice for the industrial production of isomaltulose.
TI  - Fate of the H-NS-repressed bgl operon in evolution of Escherichia coli.
AB  - In the enterobacterial species Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, expression of horizontally acquired genes with a higher than average AT content is repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS. A classical example of an H-NS-repressed locus is the bgl (aryl-beta,D-glucoside) operon of E. coli. This locus is "cryptic," as no laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve repression of bgl by H-NS in E. coli K12. However, repression can be relieved by spontaneous mutations. Here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. Typing of bgl in a representative collection of E. coli demonstrated that it evolved clonally and that it is present in strains of the phylogenetic groups A, B1, and B2, while it is presumably replaced by a cluster of ORFans in the phylogenetic group D. Interestingly, the bgl operon is mutated in 20% of the strains of phylogenetic groups A and B1, suggesting erosion of bgl in these groups. However, bgl is functional in almost all B2 isolates and, in approximately 50% of them, it is weakly expressed at laboratory growth conditions. Homologs of bgl genes exist in Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Erwinia species and also in low GC-content Gram-positive bacteria, while absent in E. albertii and Salmonella sp. This suggests horizontal transfer of bgl genes to an ancestral Enterobacterium. Conservation and weak expression of bgl in isolates of phylogenetic group B2 may indicate a functional role of bgl in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Diversity of root associated microorganisms of selected medicinal plants and influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antimicrobial property of Coriandrum sativum.
AB  - The total heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were enumerated from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of 50 selected locally available medicinal plants in and around Bharathiar University. In all the plants, population of microorganism were higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non rhizosphere soil. Among the microorganisms, bacterial population was higher in number followed by fungus and actinomycetes. Of the medicinal plants, the maximum rhizosphere effect was observed in Annona squamosa and the minimum effect was seen in Eclipta alba and Cassia auriculata. Among the bacteria the dominant species was Bacillus followed by Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus and Serratia. The Streptomyces species was found to be dominant followed by Deuteromycetes and Frankia among the actinomycetes. Among the fungal isolates Rhizopus was found to be higher in number followed by Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor and Fusarium. About 70.96% of the bacterial isolates were found to be nitrate reducers and 90.60% of the bacteria solubilised phosphate. The rhizosphere bacterial isolates were also capable of hydrolyzing starch, cellulose, casein, urea and gelatin. The isolates of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungus were also able to produce phytohormone Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The maximum IAA production was recorded by Fusarium sp (5.8 mg/l). The rhizosphere bacterial isolates showed resistance to 14 commercially used antibiotics. In an attempt to check the influence of these plant growth promoting microorganisms on the antimicrobial property of Coriandrum sativum against Escherichia coli MTCC-443 and Aeromonas hydrophila MTCC-646, the results observed was not encouraging since the inoculants did not influence the antibacterial property. However extensive and in depth study is required to find out the influence of rhizomicroorganisms on the antibacterial property of medicinal plants. The other results clearly indicated that the rhizosphere microorganisms could be exploited for its innumerable properties and active metabolites.
TI  - A dormancy state in nonspore-forming bacteria.
AB  - While cultivation is a convenient way of proliferating and understanding bacteria, studies have shown the formation of nonculturable cells in nonspore-forming bacteria in response to environmental stress and thus in turn have generated immense interest. Whether these cells are in a state of dormancy or in a stage preceding cell death has been considered of paramount importance for the past couple of decades. In this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and revived by osmotic down-shift in the absence of nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation factor(s). Reversal of dormancy followed a definite pattern akin to population asynchrony of dormant cells, and the phenomenon was observed across three species, namely, Enterobacter sp. strain mcp11b, Klebsiella pneumonia strain mcp11d and Escherichia coli. In addition, our study precisely forecasted the presence of multiple subpopulations in dormant cells, which is explained by an emerging theory of survival mechanisms in stressful environments. These observations reveal that the state of dormancy induced by environmental stress in these nonspore-forming bacteria is "reversible" and also implies that it is an orderly and spontaneous adaptation to circumvent adverse conditions.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cloning, characterization and expression of the chitinase gene of Enterobacter sp. NRG4.
AB  - A chitinase producing bacterium Enterobacter sp. NRG4, previously isolated in our laboratory, has been reported to have a wide range of applications such as anti-fungal activity, generation of fungal protoplasts and production of chitobiose and N-acetyl D-glucosamine from swollen chitin. In this paper, the gene coding for Enterobacter chitinase has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The structural portion of the chitinase gene comprised of 1686 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of chitinase has high degree of homology (99.0%) with chitinase from Serratia marcescens. The recombinant chitinase was purified to near homogeneity using His-Tag affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant chitinase had a specific activity of 2041.6 U mg(-1). It exhibited similar properties pH and temperature optima of 5.5 and 45 degrees C respectively as that of native chitinase. Using swollen chitin as a substrate, the K(m), k(cat) and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) values of recombinant chitinase were found to be 1.27 mg ml(-1), 0.69 s(-1) and 0.54 s(-1)M(-1) respectively. Like native chitinase, the recombinant chitinase produced medicinally important N-acetyl D-glucosamine and chitobiose from swollen chitin and also inhibited the growth of many fungi.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial contamination with antibiotic-resistant and enterotoxigenic fecal coliforms in treated drinking water.
AB  - Pollution indicator bacteria such as coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci were enumerated using a multiple-tube fermentation method in 100 treated drinking-water samples from 20 locations in residential, commercial, and industrial areas of a tropical city during summer. Thirty-four percent of the samples were bacteriologically nonpotable. Maximum coliform-contaminated (27%) samples were derived from industrial areas, while samples contaminated with fecal coliform (23%) and fecal streptococci (20%) originated from commercial areas. Coliforms identified as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. were present in 29%, 26%, 24%, and 15% of samples, respectively. Fecal coliforms were examined for antibiotic susceptibility with disc diffusion method. All test isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) for kanamycin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. Escherichia coli isolates were examined for enterotoxigenicity using the suckling mice bioassay and 60% of the isolates displayed enterotoxigenicity. Data indicate that drinking water contaminated with antibiotic-resistant enterotoxigenic fecal bacteria may be responsible for presence of waterborne diarrheal diseases attributed to therapeutic agents used by urban populations in the tropics.
TI  - Screening, cloning, expression, and purification of an acidic arylmalonate decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae KU1313.
AB  - We have already isolated, purified, and characterized arylmalonate decarboxylases (AMDase; EC. 4.1.1.76) from Alcaligenes bronchisepticus KU1201 and Achromobacter sp. KU1311. These are unique enzymes that give optically pure alpha-arylpropionates from the corresponding alpha-aryl-alpha-methylmalonates. Recently, we have further screened novel AMDase producers from soil samples under acidic conditions and succeeded in isolating Enterobacter cloacae KU1313. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The AMDase gene consists of 720 nucleotides, which specifies a 240-amino-acid protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified and shown that the pH-activity profiles were quite different from those of known AMDases.
TI  - Identification of the 4-hydroxycinnamate decarboxylase (PAD) gene of Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - A 7.1-kbp DNA fragment isolated from a wild strain of Klebsiella oxytoca was sequenced, leading to the identification of 10 open-reading frames (ORFs), including a 504-bp Pad gene. The Pad gene of the Gram-negative bacterium was subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli as a chimeric Pad. The deduced amino acid (AA) sequence of the Pad gene from wild-type K. oxytoca showed approximately 50% homology to those of other bacterial PADs from Gram-positive bacilli plus a coccus. These data and a genomic library search of some gamma-proteobacteria, including E. coli and Vibrio sp., indicated that PAD of K. oxytoca is a member of the bacterial PAD family characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria. Using Pad-specific PCR primers designed from the Gram-negative bacterial Pad of K. oxytoca, Pad genes of two further strains of K. oxytoca, another wild isolate and JCM 1665 and two PAD-positive Enterobacter spp. were successfully amplified for specific Pad detection.
TI  - Type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pOLA52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in Enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pOLA52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Screening of a transposon-mutagenized pOLA52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkABCDF operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pOLA52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. The conjugative transfer rate of pOLA52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. Through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be expressed as a single operon. Immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (MrkA)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. When transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, pOLA52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pOLA52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3 fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of the plasmid-harbouring strain.
TI  - Biochemical reference intervals and intestinal microflora of free-ranging Ricord's iguanas (Cyclura ricordii).
AB  - Caribbean iguanas, including the Ricord's iguana (Cyclura ricordii) are ranked as critically endangered on the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The taxon is endemic to Hispaniola, where it inhabits xeric lowlands and is found in a very limited range in two subpopulations in the southwestern area of the island. The goals of this study were to obtain and analyze plasma biochemical and intestinal microbiological data from Ricord's iguanas in the subpopulation of the Neiba Valley, on Cabritos Island National Park, Dominican Republic, and to establish biochemical reference intervals. A total of 23 blood samples from clinically healthy iguanas (16 males, 7 females) and 14 fecal samples from clinically healthy iguanas were analyzed. Adult female iguanas had higher concentrations of cholesterol, phosphorus, triglycerides, urea, uric acid, and aspartate transaminase activity compared with male iguanas, although the difference was not statistically significant. Seventeen bacterial isolates were obtained, including: Salmonella sp. (serogroup B; serogroup D negative) Escherichia coli, Brevibacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus durans. These data will help contribute to the management and recovery of Ricord's iguana populations.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Substrate specificity of the OqxAB multidrug resistance pump in Escherichia coli  and selected enteric bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, OqxAB, identified in Escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. The ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. METHODS: The MICs of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic E. coli strains, except for the presence of the oqxAB operon. A derivative of the plasmid encoding OqxAB (pOLA52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to Salmonella Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. The effect of the presence of the OqxAB pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. RESULTS: The OqxAB pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in E. coli. These included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pOLA52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. Transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. CONCLUSIONS: The plasmid-encoded OqxAB pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between Enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. These results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species.
TI  - Inhibition of hydrogen uptake in Escherichia coli by expressing the hydrogenase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular hydrogen is an environmentally-clean fuel and the reversible (bi-directional) hydrogenase of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as well as the native Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3 hold great promise for hydrogen generation. These enzymes perform the simple reaction 2H+ + 2e- <--> H2 (g). RESULTS: Hydrogen yields were enhanced up to 41-fold by cloning the bidirectional hydrogenase (encoded by hoxEFUYH) from the cyanobacterium into E. coli. Using an optimized medium, E. coli cells expressing hoxEFUYH also produced twice as much hydrogen as the well-studied Enterobacter aerogenes HU-101, and hydrogen gas bubbles are clearly visible from the cultures. Overexpression of HoxU alone (small diaphorase subunit) accounts for 43% of the additional hydrogen produced by HoxEFUYH. In addition, hydrogen production in E. coli mutants with defects in the native formate hydrogenlyase system show that the cyanobacterial hydrogenase depends on both the native E. coli hydrogenase 3 as well as on its maturation proteins. Hydrogen absorption by cells expressing hoxEFUYH was up to 10 times lower than cells which lack the cloned cyanobacterial hydrogenase; hence, the enhanced hydrogen production in the presence of hoxEFUYH is due to inhibition of hydrogen uptake activity in E. coli. Hydrogen uptake by cells expressing hoxEFUYH was suppressed in three wild-type strains and in two hycE mutants but not in a double mutant defective in hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2; hence, the active cyanobacterial locus suppresses hydrogen uptake by hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2 but not by hydrogenase 3. Differential gene expression indicated that overexpression of HoxEFUYH does not alter expression of the native E. coli hydrogenase system; instead, biofilm-related genes are differentially regulated by expression of the cyanobacterial enzymes which resulted in 2-fold elevated biofilm formation. This appears to be the first enhanced hydrogen production by cloning a cyanobacterial enzyme into a heterologous host. CONCLUSION: Enhanced hydrogen production in E. coli cells expressing the cyanobacterial HoxEFUYH is by inhibiting hydrogen uptake of both hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2.
TI  - Simvastatin improves the healing of infected skin wounds of rats.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study explores the potential of the simvastatin to ameliorate inflammation and infection in open infected skin wounds of rats. METHODS: Fourteen Wistar rats weighing 285 +/- 12g were used. The study was done in a group whose open infected skin wounds were treated with topical application of simvastatin microemulsion (SIM, n=7) and a second group with wounds treated with saline 0.9 % (SAL, n=7). A bacteriological exam of the wounds fluid for gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the tecidual expression of TNFa and IL-1a by immunohistochemical technique, and histological analysis by HE stain were performed. RESULTS: The expression of TNFa could be clearly demonstrated in lower degree in skin wounds treated with simvastatin (668.6 +/- 74.7 im(2)) than in saline (2120.0 +/-327.1 im(2)). In comparison, wound tissue from SIM group displayed leukocyte infiltration significantly lower than that observed in SAL group (p<0.05). Culture results of the samples taken from wound fluid on fourth post treatment day revealed wound infection in only one rat of group simvastatin (SIM), where Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp were isolated. In the rats whose wounds were treated with saline (SAL), polymicrobial infection with more than 100,000 CFU/g was detected in all the wounds. CONCLUSION: In addition to its antiinflammatory properties, the protective effects of simvastatin in infected open skin wounds is able to reduce infection and probably has antibacterial action. The potential to treat these wounds with statins to ameliorate inflammation and infection is promising.
TI  - Serological cross-reactivity of environmental isolates of Enterobacter, Escherichia, Stenotrophomonas, and Aerococcus with Shigella spp.-specific antisera.
AB  - Using protocols designed for the isolation of Shigella from environmental freshwater samples from different regions of Bangladesh, 11 bacterial strains giving rise to Shigella-like colonies on selective agar plates and showing serological cross-reaction with Shigella-specific antisera were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that three of the isolates were most closely related to Escherichia coli, four to Enterobacter sp., two to Stenotrophomonas, and two isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genus Aerococcus. The isolates cross-reacted with six different serotypes of Shigella and were, in each case, highly type-specific. Two of the isolates belonging to the Enterobacter and Escherichia genera gave extremely strong cross-reactivity with Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii antisera, respectively. The Aerococcus isolates gave relatively weak but significant cross-reactions with S. dysenteriae. Western blot analysis revealed that a number of antigens from the isolates cross-react with Shigella spp. The results indicate that important Shigella spp. surface antigens are shared by a number of environmental bacteria, which have implications for the use of serological methods in attempts for the detection and recovery of Shigella from aquatic environments.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Midgut bacteria required for Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal activity.
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis is the most widely applied biological insecticide and is used to manage insects that affect forestry and agriculture and transmit human and animal pathogens. This ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium kills insect larvae largely through the action of insecticidal crystal proteins and is commonly deployed as a direct bacterial spray. Moreover, plants engineered with the cry genes encoding the B. thuringiensis crystal proteins are the most widely cultivated transgenic crops. For decades, the mechanism of insect killing has been assumed to be toxin-mediated lysis of the gut epithelial cells, which leads to starvation, or B. thuringiensis septicemia. Here, we report that B. thuringiensis does not kill larvae of the gypsy moth in the absence of indigenous midgut bacteria. Elimination of the gut microbial community by oral administration of antibiotics abolished B. thuringiensis insecticidal activity, and reestablishment of an Enterobacter sp. that normally resides in the midgut microbial community restored B. thuringiensis-mediated killing. Escherichia coli engineered to produce the B. thuringiensis insecticidal toxin killed gypsy moth larvae irrespective of the presence of other bacteria in the midgut. However, when the engineered E. coli was heat-killed and then fed to the larvae, the larvae did not die in the absence of the indigenous midgut bacteria. E. coli and the Enterobacter sp. achieved high populations in hemolymph, in contrast to B. thuringiensis, which appeared to die in hemolymph. Our results demonstrate that B. thuringiensis-induced mortality depends on enteric bacteria.
TI  - [Etiologic factors of acute gastroenteritis in the patients from infectious and pediatric wards in SP ZOZ in Hajnowka in 2004-2005].
AB  - Acute infections of the digestive tract, clinically presenting as acute gastroenteritis, may have different ethiologic basis. Both bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp.) and viruses (Rotaviruses, Adenoviruses) are frequently isolated ethiologic factors. In some cases the ethiologic factor cannot be detected.
TI  - qnr prevalence in ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates from the United States.
AB  - We screened 313 ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained in the United States from 1999 to 2004 for all three known qnr genes. A qnr gene was present in 20% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 31% of Enterobacter sp. isolates, and 4% of Escherichia coli isolates. qnrA and qnrB occurred with equivalent frequencies and, except for qnrB in enterobacters, were stable over time. qnrS was absent.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae P240.
AB  - We found the occurrence of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase in Enterobacter cloacae P240, isolated from soils under anaerobic conditions, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. The purified enzyme was a homohexamer of identical 60 kDa subunits. The purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. Its Km value for 4-hydroxybenzoate was 596 microM. The enzyme also catalyzed decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, for which the Km value was 6.80 mM. In the presence of 3 M KHCO3 and 20 mM phenol, the decarboxylase catalyzed the reverse carboxylation reaction of phenol to form 4-hydroxybenzoate with a molar conversion yield of 19%. The Km value for phenol was calculated to be 14.8 mM. The gene encoding the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase was isolated from E. cloacae P240. Nucleotide sequencing of recombinant plasmids revealed that the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase gene codes for a 475-amino-acid protein. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme is similar to those of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum (53% identity), VdcC protein (vanillate decarboxylase) of Streptomyces sp. strain D7 (72%) and 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Escherichia coli (28%). The hypothetical proteins, showing 96-97% identities to the primary structure of E. cloacae P240 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, were found in several bacterial strains.
TI  - Confirmation of E. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  - Paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. Some are rich in wood fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. Others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. Still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their coliform microflora. Therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. For the first series of analyses, the medium used was Colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to isolate bacteria in pure culture on MacConkey agar. In a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase activities, were used to isolate bacteria. First, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. Also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 MPN/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. From this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on MacConkey medium and identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter sp, E. sakazakii, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Pantoea sp, Raoultella terrigena, R. planticola. Second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 MPN/g (d.w) sludge, whereas E. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 MPN/g (d.w.) sludge. The presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in large quantities. Also, indigenous E. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated E. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. In this second series of isolations, API20E and Biolog identified most isolates as E. coli, but others remained unidentified. The sequences of the 16S rDNA confirmed that most isolates were likely E. coli, few Burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. This study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Engineering aromatic L-amino acid transaminase for the asymmetric synthesis of constrained analogs of L-phenylalanine.
AB  - An enzymatic asymmetric synthesis was carried out for the preparation of enantiomerically pure L-diphenylalanine using the rationally engineered aromatic L-amino acid transaminase (eAroATEs) obtained from Enterobacter sp. BK2K-1. To rationally redesign the enzyme, structural model was constructed by the homology modeling. The structural model was experimentally validated by the site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) binding site and the substrate-recognition region, and the cell-free protein synthesis of mutated enzymes. It was suggested that Arg281 and Arg375 were the key residues to recognize the distal carboxylate and alpha-carboxylate group of the substrates, respectively. The model also predicted that Tyr66 forms hydrogen bond with the phosphate moiety of PLP and interacts with the side chain attached to beta-carbon of the amino acid substrate. Among the various site-directed mutants, Y66L variant was able to synthesize L-diphenylalanine with 23% conversion yield for 10 h, whereas the wild-type AroATEs was inactive for the transamination between diphenylpyruvate and L-phenylalanine as amino acceptor and amino donor, respectively.
TI  - Purification and characterization of TrzF: biuret hydrolysis by allophanate hydrolase supports growth.
AB  - TrzF, the allophanate hydrolase from Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned,  overexpressed in the presence of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. Native TrzF had a subunit molecular weight of 65,401 and a subunit stoichiometry of alpha(2) and did not contain significant levels of metals. TrzF showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of the amidase signature protein family. TrzF was highly active in the hydrolysis of allophanate but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. TrzF showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. The allophanate hydrolase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, AtzF, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. Since biuret and allophanate are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing atzD, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzF grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. The amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of 3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. In vitro, TrzF was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia. The biuret hydrolyzing activity of TrzF might also be physiologically relevant in native strains. E. cloacae strain 99 grows on cyanuric acid with a significant accumulation of biuret.
TI  - Improvement on production of (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate and (S)-3-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone with recombinant Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - (R)-4-Chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate (CHB) and (S)-3-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone (HL) are used for the synthesis of biologically and pharmacologically important compounds. Enterobacter sp. DS-S-75 was found to have the unique activity to convert (S)-CHB in the racemate to (S)-HL through asymmetric dechlorination, hydrolysis, and lactonization. As a result, the remaining (R)-CHB and formed (S)-HL could be obtained in a one-pot reaction. We purified the CHB degrading enzyme which catalyzing these reactions and isolated the coding gene from the strain DS-S-75 in order to improve the productivity of these compounds using the transformant. Interestingly, the purified enzyme showed not only dechlorinating, but also hydrolyzing activities on CHB and the similar carboxylic esters, it was then designated CHB hydrolase, and appears to be a novel enzyme. The gene had 1101 bp encoding 367 amino acids including a signal peptide composed of 25 residues. The deduced amino acid sequence contained a conserved region generally found in esterases and lipases, but did not have significant similarity. When asymmetric degradation of racemic methyl CHB (CHBM) was performed using a culture broth of Escherichia coli DH5alpha transformed with the isolated gene, the reaction time was shortened 20-fold over that of the strain DS-S-75, and the maximum concentration of the substrate could be increased from 8% to 15% (w/v). Moreover, both of the obtained residual (R)-CHBM and the formed (S)-HL had high optical purities (>99% e.e.).
TI  - Isolation of a novel plasmid, pNi15, from Enterobacter sp. Ni15 containing a nickel resistance gene.
AB  - We isolated nickel-resistant bacterium from soil in order to identify a novel nickel resistance determinant. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, an isolate was identified as Enterobacter sp. Ni15. This species showed a medium-level (resistant to up to 10 mM) nickel resistance in nutrient-rich media. Enterobacter sp. Ni15 has a novel plasmid, pNi15, and an increased nickel resistance to Escherichia coli DH5alphain trans. To isolate the nickel resistance gene from pNi15, the plasmid was digested with XbaI and its fragments were cloned into pBluescriptIISK(+). The clones were transferred into E. coli DH5alpha. The nickel resistance of the clones was then assayed. From these results, a pNi15100 isolate containing a 5,328 bp XbaI fragment of pNi15 was identified and sequenced. The E. coli DH5alpha harboring the pNi15100 showed a resistance to up to 7 mM nickel. Using a subcloning analysis, we were able to identify the novel nickel resistance determinant: the nrp gene encoding the putative proteins NrpA and NrpB.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and characterization of a novel phosphatase gene, phoI, from  soil bacterium Enterobacter sp. 4.
AB  - A gene, phoI, coding for a phosphatase from Enterobacter sp. 4 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed one open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 269-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29 kDa. PhoI belongs to family B acid phosphatase and exhibits 49.4% identity and 62.4% homology to the hel gene from Heamophilus influenzae, which encoded an outer membrane protein (P4). The optimum pH and temperature for phosphatase activity were pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Its specific activity on rho-nitrophenyl phosphatate was 70 U/mg at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C. Enzyme activity was inhibited by Al3+, EDTA, and DTT, but fivefold activated by Cu2+ ion (350 U/mg). PhoI showed a strong synergistic effect when used with a purified E. coli phytase, AppA, to estimate combination effects.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic modeling of imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric therapy of skin and soft tissue infections: a report from the OPTAMA Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bactericidal exposures necessary for positive clinical outcomes among skin and soft tissue infections are largely dependent on interpatient pharmacokinetic variability and pathogen drug susceptibility. By simulating the probability of achieving target bactericidal exposures, the pharmacodynamics of three beta-lactam agents were compared against a range of pathogens implicated commonly in complicated skin and soft tissue infections. METHODS: Using Monte Carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic target attainment expressed as the percentage of the time interval during which the antibiotic concentration exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (%T > MIC) in serum and blister fluid was calculated for 5,000 simulated patients receiving imipenem-cilastatin 0.5 g q8h, meropenem 0.5 g q8h, piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h. The pharmacokinetics for each antibiotic were derived from previously published healthy volunteer studies. The MICs for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, Proteus sp., beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Serratia sp. were taken from the MYSTIC 2003 surveillance study and weighted by the prevalence of each pathogen among 1,404 isolates collected from skin and soft tissue infections during the 2000 SENTRY study. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was added into the model at increasing resistance rates. RESULTS: Imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h achieved greater than 90% likelihood of achieving bactericidal exposure in serum and blister fluid until the prevalence of MRSA increased beyond 10%. Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h achieved a lower probability of achieving bactericidal exposure than the other regimens (88.7%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When the incidence of MRSA is low, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h would be optimal choices for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections among the regimens studied. When MRSA is suspected, a drug that retains activity against this pathogen should be considered.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - [Profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia].
AB  - The profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 Klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola, K. mobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marscescens, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. The utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: Klebsiella (profiles No. 1--6, 9, 10), Enterobacter (No. 11--13), Serratia (No. 14--16), Escherichia (No. 17). The full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of K. mobilis (No. 1, 6) and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia was established, which confirmed that K. mobilis (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - The prevalence of bacterial resistance in clinical, food, water and some environmental samples in Southwest Nigeria.
AB  - The resistance pattern and mechanisms of bacterial isolates obtained from clinical origin, soil, industrial effluent, orange juice products and drinking water were studied using commonly used antibiotics. The microbial load of the water samples, industrial effluent and orange juice products were 1.0 x 10(1)-2.25 x 10(6), 2.15 x 10(5), and 3.5 x 10(4)-2.15 x 10(5) cfu mL(-1), respectively. The faecal coliform test revealed that only two out of twenty orange juice products had MPN of 2 and 20, the MPN of water ranged from 1-> or = 1800, while the effluent had MPN of > or = 1800. The bacterial isolates that were isolated include E. coli, S. aureus, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, S. pyogenes, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus sp., Klebsiella sp., P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp. Also, clinical and soil isolates of P. aeruginosa were used in the study. Among the eight antibiotics tested for resistance on five strains of each bacterium, seven different resistance patterns were observed among the bacterial isolates obtained from water, effluent and orange juice products. Among the clinical and soil isolates of P. aeruginosa, four multiple-drug resistance patterns were obtained. Thirty strains of E. coli and S. aureus were tested for beta-lactamase production and fourteen strains, seven each of E. coli and S. aureus that had high Minimum Inhibitory Concentration values (MIC) for both Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin were positive.
TI  - [Distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou. METHODS: From July 2001 to August 2003, the resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard Kirby-Bauer method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2000). WHONET-5 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were Escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). The total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). The prevalences of ESBLs-producing strains in the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Proteus SP. in Guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. According to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by Cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). Imipenem was the most effective agents against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., and Proteus SP. isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-ESBLs-producing strains (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in Guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. An unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. Imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in Guangzhou.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzyme KPC-2 in an Enterobacter sp.
AB  - A strain of an Enterobacter sp. with reduced susceptibility to imipenem, which produced a plasmid-mediated class A carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzyme, KPC-2 beta-lactamase, was isolated from a patient with sepsis at a Boston hospital. This is the first report of the production of a plasmid-encoded KPC-2 beta-lactamase by an Enterobacter sp.
TI  - [Development and evaluation of a PCR method for diagnosis of Salmonella enteric fever, based on DNA sequences of the hilA gene].
AB  - Typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to Salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. Salmonella spp. uses the hilA gene (component of the pathogenicity island I) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. Using the hilA gene sequence a PCR test was designed to detect Salmonella in blood samples. The sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. Presence of S. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. Blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-Salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 4). Control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV for the PCR method were all 100%. The lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by PCR in blood samples was 10.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. Five University Clinics and/or Regional Hospitals in the Slovak Republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (13.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter sp. All CONS and S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the CONS and only for 4% of S. aureus isolates. A higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in CONS in comparison to S. aureus. Enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against E. coli. Although 17% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against K. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Validation of a PCR for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hilA gene in clinical samples from Colombian patients.
AB  - Validation of a PCR test to detect hilA gene sequences of Salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. Sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and Enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy volunteers. To evaluate S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due Salmonella spp. (S. Typhimurium, 21; S. Enteritidis, 9; S. Choleraesuis, 3 and S. Agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to Shigella sonnei (8), Shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic E. coli (12), Aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in blood samples were all 100 %. PCR detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. In faeces samples, S was 97 %, SP 100 %, PPV 100 % and NPV 99 %. The lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by PCR in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of essential oils on microorganisms isolated from urinary tract infection].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from medicinal plants (Ocimum gratissimum, L., Cybopogum citratus (DC) Stapf., and Salvia officinalis, L.) was assessed on bacterial strains derived from 100 urine samples. Samples were taken from subjects diagnosed with urinary tract infection living in the community. Microorganisms were plated on Muller Hinton agar. Plant extracts were applied using a Steers replicator and petri dishes were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Salvia officinalis, L. showed enhanced inhibitory activity compared to the other two herbs, with 100% efficiency against Klebsiella and Enterobacter species, 96% against Escherichia coli, 83% against Proteus mirabilis, and 75% against Morganella morganii.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - [Sepsis in childhood: epidemiological profile and microbiologic diagnosis]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish an etiological and epidemiological profile of sepsis among children that were hospitalized in the Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin - HIAS (a reference public hospital for all pediatric diseases in the state of Ceara), since this disease has been of high prevalence in this hospital with considerable mortality. METHODS: All children admitted in the hospital from January 1993 to June 1994, who presented sepsis or developed nosocomial sepsis and presented positive blood cultures were studied prospectively. The epidemiologic study was conducted by gathering information in questionnaire form about the following factors: sex, age, reference area, nutritional status, complaints at admission, sepsis origin (nosocomial or not), and outcome for each case. Microbiologic analysis were formed by means of blood culture, concomitant with sensitivity tests of the isolated bacteria to the most commonly used antibiotics. All samples were processed at the Laboratory of Microbiology of the Health's Science Center of the Federal University in Ceara. RESULTS: 205 children were studied of which 17 presented two septic episodes, making a total of 222 episodes in the period. 56.1% of them were male, 81.4% were less than one-year old, 71.1% were malnourished children and 60.5% came from the countryside of the Ceara State. At the moment of their admission, two-thirds of the children presented gastrointestinal problems (diarrhea) or respiratory complaints, whereas 47.7% of the episodes of sepsis were acquired in hospital. The mortality rate was 56.1%. Blood culture test showed a predominance of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (24.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.2%), Enterobacter sp (11.2%), Escherichia coli (7%), and others (19.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological profile of the population in this study was the following: these children were less than one-year old, the majority of them were malnourished and when they were hospitalized, presented with symptoms of diarrhea or respiratory disease. 40% of them had a disease or situation that favored the development of sepsis. The predominant bacterias were Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Synergetic effect of gamma irradiation and moisture content on decontamination of sewage sludge.
AB  - Samples of concentrated municipal sewage sludge, stored for 2, 4 and 6 months, with moisture contents of 2%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% were exposed to doses of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kilogray (kGy) of gamma irradiation. Immediately after irradiation, total microbial count and bacterial pathogens in sewage sludge were determined. The results indicated that in all tested sewage sludge samples, bacterial pathogens including Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., and Escherichia coli were initially detected. All doses of gamma irradiation reduced the total counts of microorganisms. D(10) of total count decreased with increase in the moisture content of the sewage sludge. The lowest lethal dose for tested bacterial pathogens was 5 kGy in air dried sewage sludge. In addition for wet sewage sludge having more than 40% moisture, the lethal dose was 1 kGy, for samples taken at different storage periods 2, 4 and 6 months, and therefore the cost per unit could be decreased to half when wet sewage sludge (about 50% moisture) was used.
TI  - Catecholamines and in vitro growth of pathogenic bacteria: enhancement of growth  varies greatly among bacterial species.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of catecholamines on in vitro growth of a range of bacterial species, including anaerobes. Bacteria tested included: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteriodes fragilis, Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnie, Enterobacter Sp, and Salmonella choleraesuis. The results of the current study indicated that supplementation of bacterial cultures in minimal medium with norepinephrine or epinephrine did not result in increased growth of bacteria. Positive controls involving treatment of Escherichia coli with catecholamines did result in increased growth of that bacterial species. The results of the present study extend previous observations that showed differential capability of catecholamines to enhance bacterial growth in vitro.
TI  - Surfactant proteins A and D inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria by increasing membrane permeability.
AB  - The pulmonary collectins, surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), have been reported to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS), opsonize microorganisms, and enhance the clearance of lung pathogens. In this study, we examined the effect of SP-A and SP-D on the growth and viability of Gram-negative bacteria. The pulmonary clearance of Escherichia coli K12 was reduced in SP-A-null mice and was increased in SP-D-overexpressing mice, compared with strain-matched wild-type controls. Purified SP-A and SP-D inhibited bacterial synthetic functions of several, but not all, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In general, rough E. coli strains were more susceptible than smooth strains, and collectin-mediated growth inhibition was partially blocked by coincubation with rough LPS vesicles. Although both SP-A and SP-D agglutinated E. coli K12 in a calcium-dependent manner, microbial growth inhibition was independent of bacterial aggregation. At least part of the antimicrobial activity of SP-A and SP-D was localized to their C-terminal domains using truncated recombinant proteins. Incubation of E. coli K12 with SP-A or SP-D increased bacterial permeability. Deletion of the E. coli OmpA gene from a collectin-resistant smooth E. coli strain enhanced SP-A and SP-D-mediated growth inhibition. These data indicate that SP-A and SP-D are antimicrobial proteins that directly inhibit the proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria in a macrophage- and aggregation-independent manner by increasing the permeability of the microbial cell membrane.
TI  - Extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. ESBL producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. As information on ESBL producers causing urinary tract infection (UTI) is not available from our country, the occurrence of ESBL producing strains causing UTI was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of ESBL and non-ESBL producers. METHODS: Urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by Stoke's method and ESBL production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). The clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. RESULTS: Sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were ESBL producers. Approximately 38.5 per cent of Klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of Escherichia coli, 24 per cent of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of Proteus sp. and the only Citrobacter strain produced ESBL. Recent surgery was found to be a significant (P < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of ESBLs. Approximately 30 per cent of the ESBL producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. There was no difference between the ESBL producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced ESBL. Since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for ESBL production routinely to avoid treatment failures.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - BUT-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class C beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of Buttiauxella sp.
AB  - An atypical Enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) from a patient's skull wound infection. Identifications by the API-50CHE biochemical system and 16S rRNA gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the Buttiauxella genus. The bla gene was cloned and sequenced. The deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (BUT-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of BUT-1 were comparable with results described for other Ambler class C enzymes. bla(BUT-1) and the associated ampR transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region, a genetic organization already described for other inducible class C beta-lactamases. The deduced amino acid sequence of AmpR shared 85% and 81% identity with AmpR from E. cloacae and C. freundii respectively.
TI  - CAY-I, a fungicidal saponin from Capsicum sp. fruit.
AB  - Saponins are steroidal or terpenoid-based glycosides with surface active properties. A steroidal saponin, CAY-1, with a molecular weight of 1243.35 Da, was isolated and purified to homogeneity from commercially available dry, ground fruit of Capsicum frutescens. CAY-1 was shown to be a potent fungicide for the germinating conidia of Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. parasiticus and A. niger with species-dependent LD90 values between 3 and 20 microM. Activity against some Aspergillus species was affected by the test medium used. In vitro assays, CAY-1 was effective against Pneumocystis carinii (IC50): 9.5 microM) and Candida albicans (IC90: 6.2 microM). CAY-1 had no effect on the viability of the nongerminating conidia of the two filamentous fungi, P. carinii and C. albicans, nor on the conidial type of Fusarium oxysporum. It was ineffective against the bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. CAY-1 was not cytotoxic to A 549 lung carcinoma cells or HeLa cells at effective fungicidal concentrations. The results indicate that CAY-1 is an effective fungicide for Aspergillus species, C. albicans and P. carinii at concentrations below the threshold for mammalian cell toxicity.
TI  - [Evaluation of microecology of colonic contents in patients with chronic pancreatitis].
AB  - The paper deals with microbiocenosis in the colonic content in 60 patients with chronic pancreatitis during its exacerbation. An analysis has indicated that in the colonic content there are the following microorganisms: Bifidobacterium sp., 10(8)-10(10) CFU/g; Lactobacillus sp., 10(1)-10(5) CFU/g; Escherichia coli, 10(8)-10(10) CFU/g; Enterococcus faecalis, 10(6)-10(10) CFU/g; Enterococcus faecium, 10(6)-10(10) CFU/g; the family Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Klebsiella-Enterobacter sp.), 10(1)-10(6) CFU/g; yeasty (including the Candida genus) and mold fungi, 10(1)-10(5)/g; Staphylococci, 10(1)-10(3) CFU/g. Comparing the findings with those of normal cenosis according to different authors' data suggests that there are no apparently impairments in the levels of some microoranisms, the representives of microbiocenosis in the colonic content in the examinees.
TI  - [Total and fecal coliforms, some enterobacteria staphylococcus sp. and moulds in  salads for hot dogs sold in Maracay, Venezuela].
AB  - Fast food sold on the streets are good vehicle to transmit gastrointestinal diseases to consumers because they are highly manipulated. The vegetables are a good media for pathogens growth. Raw vegetables salads for hot dog sold in Maracay were studied. Total and fecal Coliforms and Staphylococcus sp. were quantified by the Most Probable Number Technique, Coliforms and Staphylococcus isolated were partially identified. Also the mould population was quantified and identified. Microbial growth was correlated with pH and acidity measurements. MPN/g of Total Coliforms was 1.44 x 10(5) and 4.57 x 10(4) for fecal Coliforms. E. coli was no detected. 87 isolated from the Coliforms were partially identified as Citrobacter freundii variety 1 (45.09% of the isolated), C. freundii variety II (21.57%), Enterobacter aerogenes variety I (17.65%) and E. aerogenes variety II (15.69%); Staphylococcus sp. 3.93 x 10(6) MPN/g and all of its isolated (52) were coagulase negative. The mould population was 4.5 x 10(4) ufc/g, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus, sp., Fusarium sp. were partially identified. The salads presented a pH of 5.92 and an acidity of 0.78 ml of NaOH.
TI  - [Etiological factors of urinary tract infections in children].
AB  - Etiological factors of urinary tract infection in children have been studied. The Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp. and Enterobacter sp. were the most often isolated bacteria from infant and baby urine. In this age group of patients uromycoses were also affirmed. From the urine of older children (1-18 years old) mainly Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., Proteus sp. and Morganella morganii have been raised. Uropathogens' occurrence was analysed by a statistical method in the relation to age and sex of the children. The girls in the age of 1 to 18 years were more open than boys to urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and less open to infections caused by Morganella morganii and Enterococcus sp.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence and organization of the atrazine catabolic plasmid pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP.
AB  - The complete 108,845-nucleotide sequence of catabolic plasmid pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was determined. Plasmid pADP-1 was previously shown to encode AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC, which catalyze the sequential hydrolytic removal of s-triazine ring substituents from the herbicide atrazine to yield cyanuric acid. Computational analyses indicated that pADP-1 encodes 104 putative open reading frames (ORFs), which are predicted to function in catabolism, transposition, and plasmid maintenance, transfer, and replication. Regions encoding transfer and replication functions of pADP-1 had 80 to 100% amino acid sequence identity to pR751, an IncPbeta plasmid previously isolated from Enterobacter aerogenes. pADP-1 was shown to contain a functional mercury resistance operon with 99% identity to Tn5053. Complete copies of transposases with 99% amino acid sequence identity to TnpA from IS1071 and TnpA from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were identified and flank each of the atzA, atzB, and atzC genes, forming structures resembling nested catabolic transposons. Functional analyses identified three new catabolic genes, atzD, atzE, and atzF, which participate in atrazine catabolism. Crude extracts from Escherichia coli expressing AtzD hydrolyzed cyanuric acid to biuret. AtzD showed 58% amino acid sequence identity to TrzD, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase, from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRLB-12227. Two other genes encoding the further catabolism of cyanuric acid, atzE and atzF, reside in a contiguous cluster adjacent to a potential LysR-type transcriptional regulator. E. coli strains bearing atzE and atzF were shown to encode a biuret hydrolase and allophanate hydrolase, respectively. atzDEF are cotranscribed. AtzE and AtzF are members of a common amidase protein family. These data reveal the complete structure of a catabolic plasmid and show that the atrazine catabolic genes are dispersed on three disparate regions of the plasmid. These results begin to provide insight into how plasmids are structured, and thus evolve, to encode the catabolism of compounds recently added to the biosphere.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in Belgium.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant (Ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two Belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. The study of Ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic Aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. In total, 354 independently obtained Ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by GLC analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), by API 20E profiling and/or by Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (FAFLP) DNA fingerprinting. In general, Ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (Amp) tolerance compared to the Ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). FAME results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant Ot(r) Aeromonas strains over representatives of Acinetobacter and Escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. Among the Ot(r) mesophilic Aeromonas strain set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (Kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). To some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of Aeromonas caviae DNA hybridisation group (HG) 4. Collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for Amp and Kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable Ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. In addition, our identification data also revealed that Enterobacter sp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and A. veronii biovar sobria HG8 may be considered potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.
TI  - Unique epidemiology of nosocomial urinary tract infection in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial urinary tract infection (NUTI) occurs with varying frequency in children and is thought to be associated with urethral instrumentation. In response to changing infection control resources at our facility, we reviewed NUTI to determine whether the frequency of NUTI, associated complications, or presence of a remediable risk factor (instrumentation) justified ongoing routine infection control surveillance. METHODS: Prospective surveillance was conducted on all wards 8 months per year from January 1991 through December 1997 by an infection control nurse coordinator. NUTI was defined by laboratory evidence according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention definitions and detected 48 hours after admission. Urinary catheterization in the previous 7 days was categorized as continuous/indwelling or intermittent. RESULTS: NUTI was the fifth most common nosocomial infection (129/1375; approximately 9%) and decreased in frequency during the decade from 0.9 to approximately 0.6 cases/1000 patient days. Incidence was equal among men and women. Only 50% of cases had prior instrumentation of the urinary tract. NUTI occurred disproportionately in newborns and infants (P <.001). The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (28%; 38/132), followed by Candida sp (18%; 24/134), Enterococcus (13%; 18/134), gram-negative nonfermenters (13%; 17/132), Enterobacter (approximately 10%; 13/134), Pseudomonas (9.7%; 13/134), and other (16%; 22/134). Three cases of secondary bacteremia occurred (2.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.5-6.6); there was no mortality. CONCLUSIONS: NUTI poses a less significant burden of illness (incidence, associated morbidity) than other nosocomial infection in children. If resources do not permit hospital-wide surveillance, high-risk children with urethral instrumentation and newborns and infants could be targeted. Although E coli remains the most common cause of pediatric NUTI, fungi have become the second most common pathogen in this tertiary care population. Risk factors for NUTI in noncatheterized children remain to be delineated.
TI  - Significance of fever in Jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4 degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.
TI  - Drug Resistance in Bacteria Isolated From a Brazilian Hospital.
AB  - Bacteria commonly associated with cases of hospital infection were isolated from  samples of food, from food handless, and from objects and surfaces from different places of a hospital in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and the resistance patterns to antibiotic of these strains of bacteria were evaluated. The resistance patterns of these bacteria showed a large variation, and a high frequency of resistance to ampicillin (60.9%), cephalothin (58.7%) and carbenicillin (52.2%) was observed. The frequency of resistance to cephalosporins of 3rd and 4th-generations was 26.1% and 17.4% of the samples, respectively. Resistance to more than two drugs was observed in 27 samples (56.5%), and in four strains multiple resistance to 17 or more tested drugs was recorded. Five bacteria which were multi-resistant to antibiotics (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp, Pseudomonas sp and Staphylococcus aureus) were studied to determine the chromosomal or plasmidial genetic basis of the resistance, using plasmid curing and agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmidial DNA. It was possible to verify that for the antibiotics chloramphenicol and kanamycin, the resistance seems to be of plasmidial origin.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  - The distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria was investigated in Windermere (Cumbria, UK), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. Culturable IS1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in Windermere North Basin (WNB) and South Basin (WSB), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in WSB and to a depth of 12-13 cm in WNB). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS1 and the Escherichia coli/Shigella sp. specific gene uidA, from community DNA from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. This detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from WNB as IS1 and uidA were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. Analysis of a representative subset of 90 IS1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous IS1 profiles with estimated copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. Identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to Enterobacter spp. However, this study showed IS1 to be present in Citrobacter freundii for the first time. Plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried IS1. DNA sequence analysis of five IS1 clones demonstrated that IS1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known IS1 isoforms. Two isoforms of IS1 from a single Enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.
TI  - Use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  - The effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  Skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. Significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. Additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. In most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. Washing skin samples twice in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. Campylobacter sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Salmonella Typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. Findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.
TI  - Bacterial cholecystitis with cardiac and pulmonary dissemination in a blue-naped  mousebird (Urocolius macrourus).
AB  - A blue-naped mousebird (Urocolius macrourus) was diagnosed by gross necropsy and  histopathology as having a chronic, fibrosing bacterial cholecystitis. Acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonia and myocarditis also were present with intralesional gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria within the lungs and heart were suspected to have spread from the biliary tract because of the pattern of distribution and similar gram-staining characteristics. Enterobacter sp. and Escherichia coli were cultured from the pulmonary lesions. Cloacal cultures in clinically normal blue-naped mousebirds and speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus) yielded both Enterobacter sp. and E. coli. We hypothesize a pathogenesis in this bird consisting of biliary stasis of unknown etiology and eventual infection of the biliary tract by the normal gram-negative gastrointestinal flora. Death was believed to be a result of cardiac and respiratory dysfunction secondary to the bacterial dissemination from the biliary tree and endotoxemia.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Evaluation of the Petrifilm rapid coliform count plate method for coliform enumeration from surimi-based imitation crab slurry.
AB  - The 3M Petrifilm rapid coliform count (RCC) plate method was compared with two conventional methods, namely violet red bile agar (VRBA) and desoxycholate lactose agar (DLA), for enumerating coliforms. The VRBA plating method is a reference method in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual and the DLA plating method is the method recommended by the Food Sanitation Law of Korea for enumeration of coliforms. Serratia sp., a coliform that was isolated from frozen surimi, was incubated in surimi-based imitation crab (SBIC) slurries and enumerated on the Petrifilm RCC, VRBA, and DLA plates. Results from the Petrifilm RCC plate were not significantly different from results from VRBA or DLA plates at P < 0.05 level. The correlation coefficient for Petrifilm RCC plates versus the VRBA method and for Petrifilm RCC plates versus the DLA method were 0.994 and 0.996, respectively. With the Petrifilm RCC plate method, we were able to estimate presumptive coliforms (except Serratia sp.) after 14 h and to enumerate confirmed coliforms (including Serratia sp.) after 24 h.
TI  - Early detection of bacteremia in the neonatal intensive care unit using the new BACTEC system.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With the newer techniques of culture analysis such as the BACTEC 9240  fluorometric detection system, detecting bacteremia in the neonate may be possible in a significantly shorter time. We hypothesized that neonatal bacteremia can be detected in less than 48 hours by this method. STUDY DESIGN: Our study included a retrospective review of 613 blood cultures obtained during the period August 1, 1995 to March 18, 1996 taken from 325 infants who had cultures drawn with a sepsis work-up and/or repeat cultures who had initial positive cultures in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Results of blood cultures were studied in conjunction with the variables of body weight, gestational age, organism grown, complete blood count (CBC), and timing of positive cultures. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's and two-tailed Student's t tests. RESULTS: The results showed that of 325 infant blood cultures 49 (15%) were positive. Of these, 64% were coagulase-negative staphylococci, 14% viridans streptococci, 8% Escherichia coli, 4% Enterococcus sp., 4% Pseudomonas sp., 2% Enterobacter sp., 2% Klebsiella sp., and 2% Candida albicans. Of the positive blood cultures taken from infants not on antibiotics at the time of culture, 54% were detected positive at 18 hours, 71% at 24 hours, and 100% by 30 hours. Detection time by organism type was as follows: coagulase-negative staphylococci, 21.7 hours; viridans streptococci, 15.6 hours; E. coli, 7.5 hours; Enterococcus sp., 12 hours; Enterobacter sp., 5 hours; Klebsiella sp., 10 hours; and Pseudomonas sp., 12 hours. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the BACTEC 9240 fluorometric detection system helps in early identification of neonatal bacteremia (in 24 to 30 hours), with Gram-negative organisms being detected earlier than Gram-positive organisms (p < 0.05) and having significantly higher immature neutrophils in a CBC (I:T ratio of > or = 0.2 (p < 0.001). Early detection of neonatal bacteremia using this method will allow earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the potentially bacteremic and bacteremic infant.
TI  - Sub-MIC ciprofloxacin effect on fimbrial production by uropathogenic Escherichia  coli strains.
AB  - The urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (UTI) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Forty-nine bacterial samples of density 10(5) CFU/ml were not considered. From the resulting 161 samples, E. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. Other microoganisms found were: Enterococcus sp. (34 samples), Staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), Proteus sp. (11), Pseudomonas sp. (11), Klebsiella sp. (8), Enterobacter sp. (6), Citrobacter sp. (3), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). The uropathogenic E. coli strains found were P-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, SDS-PAGE of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All E. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 MIC). Our results showed that: 1) P-fimbriated E. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute UTI (34%); 2) exposure to sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production in 79% of E. coli strains; 3) the pattern of SDS-PAGE fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the protein at 18 kD known as P-fimbriae.
TI  - Fulminant late-onset sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit, 1988-1997, and the impact of avoiding empiric vancomycin therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pathogens associated with fulminant (lethal within 48 hours) late-onset sepsis (occurring after 3 days of age) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the frequency of fulminant late-onset sepsis for the most common pathogens. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of sepsis in infants in a NICU over a 10-year period (1988-1997). RESULTS: There were 825 episodes of late-onset sepsis occurring in 536 infants. Thirty-four of 49 (69%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 55%-82%) cases of fulminant late-onset sepsis were caused by Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas sp., 20 (42%); Escherichia coli, 5 (10%); Enterobacter sp., 4 (8%); and Klebsiella sp., 4 (8%). The frequency of fulminant sepsis was highest for Pseudomonas sp., 20 of 36 (56%; 95% CI: 38%-72%) and lowest for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 4 of 277 (1%; 95%CI: 0%-4%). The very low frequency of fulminant sepsis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci did not increase during the period when oxacillin was used instead of vancomycin as the empiric antibiotic for Gram-positive organisms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that empiric antibiotics selected for treatment of suspected sepsis in infants >3 days old need to effectively treat Gram-negative pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas sp., because these organisms, although less frequent, are strongly associated with fulminant late-onset sepsis in the NICU. Avoiding empiric vancomycin therapy seemed to be a reasonable approach to late-onset sepsis, because of the very low frequency of fulminant sepsis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical break points: evaluation of the usefulness of cefozopran based on MIC].
AB  - Drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria to cefozopran (CZOP), which is a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated, and the usefulness of the drug was evaluated from the viewpoint of bacteriological and clinical (pneumonia) break points. The following results were obtained. 1. According to bacteriological break points, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus spp. showed low sensitivity to cefozopran (CZOP). However, the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), E. coli, and Klebsiella spp., which are often isolated as pathogens of common infections, was 100%, that of Enterobacter spp., Serratia sp., and Citrobacter sp. was 90% or higher, and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 80% or higher; the values were comparable to or better than those for ceftazidime (CAZ). These results suggest a expanded antibacterial spectrum and enhanced antibacterial potency of CZOP. 2. The estimated response rate of pneumonia to CZOP was 87.5% in outpatients and 51.9% in inpatients. Therefore, CZOP is considered to be one of the first choices especially in outpatient empiric therapy.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects Asian pear trees (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai)
AB  - A novel pathogen from Asian pears (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16S rDNA and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related Enterobacteriaceae. The 16S rDNA of the Asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of Erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. A dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as Erwinia amylovora, Enterobacter pyrinus, Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii and Escherichia coli. Dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including Biotype 100 data placed the Asian pear pathogen close to Erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species Erwinia and to the species Pantoea and Enterobacter. Another DNA relatedness study was performed by DNA hybridizations and estimation of delta Tm values. The Asian pear strains constituted a tight DNA hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of Erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta Tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. The G + C content of DNA from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. Therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from Asian pears constitute a new species and the name Erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the type strain is strain Ep 16/96T (= CFBP 4172T = DSM 12163T).
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of ACC deaminase genes from two different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  - We have recently proposed that one way that plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  (PGPR) stimulate plant growth is through the activity of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which causes a lowering of plant ethylene levels resulting in longer roots. As part of an effort to understand the role of this enzyme in PGPR, the genes for ACC deaminase from two PGPR, Enterobacter cloacae CAL2 and UW4, have been isolated. These genes are highly homologous to the ACC deaminase genes from Pseudomonas strains 6G5 and F17 and similar to the ACC deaminase gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain ACP. The region downstream (i.e., at the 3'-terminal end) of the strain UW4 ACC deaminase gene has a potential hairpin-like transcription termination site. The regions upstream of the strains UW4 and CAL2 ACC deaminase genes contain putative ribosome-binding sites; however, the promoter sequences have not yet been identified. Southern hybridization experiments suggest that there is a single copy of the ACC deaminase gene in Enterobacter cloacae strains UW4 and CAL2 and that there may be several different types of ACC deaminase genes in different microbes. The cloned ACC deaminase gene can be expressed in Escherichia coli enabling this bacterium to grow on ACC as a sole source of nitrogen and confers upon both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. strains that are transformed with this gene the ability to promote the elongation of the roots of canola seedlings.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the United States (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites), and Europe (24 sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY participants (4,119 from the United States and 939 from Canada). In both the United States and Canada, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the United States and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the United States and Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, U.S. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA, and vanB) in the Canadian microbial population. Among U.S. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
TI  - Coliforms and Salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil).
AB  - The bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of Fortaleza (Ceara, Brasil), including the coastal zones of the Ceara and Coco rivers, were examined. The study was conducted during June, September and December 1993, and March 1994. The region was divided into two areas: (i) Direct Influence Area (DIA), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) Indirect Influence Area (IIA), located near to the coastal zone, including Barra do Ceara, Kartodromo, Volta de Jurema, Mucuripe, Farol and Caca e Pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. The most probable number (MPN) of both total and fecal coliforms in DIA was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. The following bacteria were identified: Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. Results of total fecal MPN was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at Caca e Pesca beach. In December, at both DIA and IIA, Salmonella was identified in several samples. In DIA, the spatial distribution for Salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. In IIA, Salmonella was identified at Kartodromo and Farol beaches throughout the sampling period.
TI  - Results of quantitative cultures of urine by free catch and catheterization from  healthy adult horses.
AB  - Quantitative urine cultures were performed on 11 male and 11 female healthy adult horses. Urine was collected by free catch and catheterization using standard methods. Results showed that all samples collected by free catch contained less than 20,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. All samples collected by catheterization contained 500 CFU/mL or less. A significant difference was found between collection methods (P < .005), with catheterization having less contamination. In samples collected by free catch, females had significantly greater contamination than did males (P < .03). Predominant bacterial species isolated included Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus spp., Diptheroids sp., Proteus spp., and Enterococcus sp. Many samples contained multiple bacterial species. Bacterial isolates were representative of the normal bacterial flora of the equine urogenital tract. This paper establishes reference values for quantitative urine culture results in healthy adult horses to aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Risk factors for developing peritonitis caused by micro-organisms of enteral origin in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors associated with the development of peritonitis caused by enteral bacteria in peritoneal dialysis patients, including the prescription of gastric acid inhibitors as a potential risk factor. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study. SETTING: Tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fifty-five patients who entered into our continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) program during the last 6 years were included. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to establish the best determinants over the development of at least one episode of enteric peritonitis. The predictive variables included in the model were: age, gender, diabetic versus nondiabetic, polycystic versus nonpolycystic kidney diseases, history of constipation, presence or absence of moderate/severe malnutrition, peritoneal transport characteristics, peritoneal protein losses, rate of exit-site infections, rate of total peritonitis, intestinal abnormalities, and treatment with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. RESULTS: The total number of peritonitis episodes during the studied period was 88, which clustered in 34 of 55 patients. Fourteen (16%) were caused by enteric micro-organisms in 10 patients: Escherichia coli (6), Klebsiella sp (2), Enterobacter sp (1), and Enterococcus sp (5). Nine of 10 patients who developed enteric peritonitis were on gastric acid inhibitors (3 patients on omeprazole and 6 patients on H2-antagonists), while 15 of 45 patients who did not develop enteric peritonitis were on gastric acid inhibitors (all of them on H2-blockers). There were temporal relationships between the start of gastric acid inhibitors and the development of enteric peritonitis in 6 of 9 patients who were on this medication. Four of 10 patients who developed enteric peritonitis had diverticulosis. Ten of 45 patients who did not develop enteric peritonitis had been diagnosed with diverticulosis of the colon or sigmoid prior to entry to CAPD. The unique patient who was not on gastric acid inhibitors and developed enteric peritonitis, had been diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis with achlorhydria. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the treatment with gastric acid inhibitors was the only independent variable that entered into the best predictive equation over the development of enteric peritonitis (log likelihood ratio = -26.077, odds ratio = 18; 95% CI odds ratio: 2 - 155). CONCLUSION: Gastric acid inhibitors may increase the risk for developing enteric peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.
TI  - Clinical disorders in armadillos (Dasypodidae, Edentata) in captivity.
AB  - The major health problems found in 113 armadillos are presented and correlated with management in captivity. The most common of 217 recorded clinical disorders involved injury (28.5%), digestive system (17.9%), respiratory system (15.2%), nutritional deficiency (13.3%), skin problems (3.6%), septicaemia (1.8%), nervous system (1.3%), urinary system (0.9%) and effects of environmental (0.9%), with 14.7% of the cases inconclusive. Internal parasites were identified in 42.0% of faeces samples, mainly eggs of helminths (66.6%), of which the commonest were Ancylostoma sp. (33.3%), Strongyloides sp. (30.5%), Ascaris sp. (25.0%), Trichuris sp. (11.1%), and also protozoa (13.0%). Enterobacteriaceae were the bacteria most frequently isolated, with Escherichia coli the most prevalent, followed by Salmonella sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most successful treatments are listed. The influence of some captive factors on the onset of the diseases was also analysed: donated animals 91.1% and zoo born 8.8%; quarantine enclosure 84.0% and exhibition 15.0%; and related to time in captivity, 92.2% occurred with animals in the first 6 months in the zoo and 7.8% with animals more than 6 months.
TI  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities of enteric bacteria on food colours.
AB  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities on two food colours namely metanil yellow and indigo carmine by different strains of enteric bacteria were evaluated. Enteric bacteria possessed both reductive and hydrolytic capabilities which depended upon the incubation period and the type of strain. In certain bacterial strains, (Escherichia coli and Vibrio sp.), reductive activity was visible after 3 hr. Other enteric strains showed an increasing activity right from the beginning of incubation. Enterobacter cloacae appeared to be producing maximum reductive capability followed by Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli. Even enteric bacterial strains demonstrated a good response in obtaining hydrolytic activity of indigo carmine during incubation upto 10 hr, establishing the fact that the gut microflora may cause health problem to consumers.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural Ethiopian setting, Jimma Zone, south west Ethiopia.
AB  - A community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from November 1994 to August 1995 in six peasant associations, Jimma Zone. The households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets water from unprotected sources. The predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. These and other foods given to weaning age children were found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. The most frequent bacterial isolates were Enterobacter sp, Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., and Escherichia coli in that order. Various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. This calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at Sao Paulo Hospital--UNIFESP/EPM in June and July of 1992. The species distribution was as follows: Enterobacter sp. (62), Escherichia coli (308), Klebsiella pneumoniae (27), Klebsiella sp. (9), Proteus mirabilis (23), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), Pseudomonas sp. (4), Serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives (7). Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. The antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, DU 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, FK 037, imipenem, meropenem and biapenem. RESULTS: DU 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. It was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. The potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae, except for Enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than they were to cefetazidime or FK 037. When testing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active than imipenem or biapenem. In addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. CONCLUSION: The new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. However, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.
TI  - Isolation of an Acanthamoeba strain with intracellular Burkholderia pickettii infection.
AB  - Burkholderia pickettii is a facultative pathogen that has been isolated from patient sources and environmental sources including respiratory therapy solutions, deionized water and aqueous disinfectants. The organism has been associated with septicemia and respiratory tract infections. In our investigation, Burkholderia pickettii (biovar 2) was for the first time isolated from Acanthamoeba sp. (group II), a free living amoeba species recovered from the wet area of a physiotherapy unit. Pathogenic strains of acanthamoebae may cause amoebic-encephalitis (AE) and keratitis. Light and electron microscopic examinations showed that in a first step, the bacterial were phagocytized by the amoebae. In contrast to Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli that were used as food organisms and digested within food vacuoles, Burkholderia pickettii caused the amoebae to develop large vacuoles filled with completely intact and motile bacteria. 3-5 days after infection, Pseudomonas pickettii had multiplied within the enlarging parasitophorous vacuoles. Ultrastructural changes in the host cells occurred and the amoebae finally underwent rupture or lysis. In cocultivation assays we could not only reinfect the original host amoeba but Acanthamoeba strains from other habitats could successfully be infected with Burkholderia pickettii as well.
TI  - Nosocomial infections among neonates in high-risk nurseries in the United States. National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections result in considerable morbidity and mortality  among neonates in high-risk nurseries (HRNs). PURPOSE: To examine the epidemiology of nosocomial infections among neonates in level III HRNs. METHODS: Data were collected from 99 hospitals with HRNs participating in the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system, which uses standard surveillance protocols and nosocomial infection site definitions. The data included information on maternal acquisition of and risk factors for infection, such as device exposure, birth weight category (< or = 1000, 1001 through 1500, 1501 through 2500, and > 2500 g), mortality, and the relationship of the nosocomial infection to death. RESULTS: From October 1986 through September 1994, these hospitals submitted data on 13 179 nosocomial infections. The bloodstream was the most frequent site of nosocomial infection in all birth weight groups. Nosocomial pneumonia was the second most common infection site, followed by the gastrointestinal and eye, ear, nose, and throat sites. The most common nosocomial pathogens among all neonates were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Enterobacter sp, and Escherichia coli. Group B streptococci were associated with 46% of bloodstream infections that were maternally acquired; coagulase-negative staphylococci were associated with 58% of bloodstream infections that were not maternally acquired, most of which (88%) were associated with umbilical or central intravenous catheters. CONCLUSIONS: Bloodstream infections, the most frequent nosocomial infections in all birth weight groups, should be a major focus of surveillance and prevention efforts in HRNs. For bloodstream infections, stratification of surveillance data by maternal acquisition will help focus prevention efforts for group B streptococci outside the HRN. Within the nursery, bloodstream infection surveillance should focus on umbilical or central intravenous catheter use, a major risk factor for infection.
TI  - The detection of verocytotoxins in bacterial cultures from human diarrhoeal samples with monoclonal antibody-based ELISAs.
AB  - Bacterial cultures from 1801 human diarrhoeal faecal specimens were examined for  verocytotoxins I and II by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISAs. Of the 68 ELISA-positive cultures selected from initial screening, 32 were positive by ELISA on repeat or from freshly grown cultures. ELISA-positive pure cultures were obtained from 13 of these, of which seven were confirmed as verocytotoxin positive by cytotoxicity assay. These seven strains were typed as O26 (5) and O146 (2). The six false positive results were from isolates of Enterobacter sp. (1), Citrobacter Freundii (1) and Escherichia coli (4), one each of types O1, O18ac and O98 and an untypable strain. Despite the occurrence of false positive reactions, sandwich ELISA was a useful method for the rapid screening of samples, and detected verocytotoxin-positive E. coli strains, other than O157, from patients with clinical conditions in which they could be implicated.
TI  - [Enterobacteria in areas of water along the Crimean coast].
AB  - Characteristic of coliform bacteria in the coastal sea ecosystems is given. A decrease of Escherichia coli indicator value was ascertained and presence of Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter freundii was revealed, in the sea areas with high level of anthropogenic load. Wide distribution of bacteria of Enterobacter agglomerans kind was determined in the sea substrates and their stability to unfavourable influences was shown.
TI  - A prospective study of Gram-negative bacteremia in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital- and community-acquired Gram-negative bacteremia is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in pediatric medical centers. Gram-negative organisms are isolated in > 50% of pediatric patients with bacteremia. OBJECTIVES: To analyze clinical and epidemiologic variables associated with Gram-negative bacteremia in a tertiary children's medical center. METHODS: A 6-year prospective study of children with Gram-negative bacteremia in a tertiary care children's medical center in Israel. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-four episodes of Gram-negative bacteremia were studied during 6 years. The predominant isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which accounted for 109, 81 and 79 episodes (26, 20 and 19%), respectively. Of all episodes 43% occurred in neonates and infants younger than 2 years and 47% were hospital-acquired. Underlying conditions mainly acute leukemia and lymphoma, were present in 55% of the patients. Urinary tract infection followed by lower respiratory tract infection were the most common identified sources of bacteremia. Central intravenous catheters were associated with 53% of the episodes. The crude mortality was 11.4%. Increased mortality was significantly associated with acute leukemia, neutropenia, hospital-acquired infections and previous corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.03, 0.003, 0.006 and 0.01, respectively). Increased antibiotic resistance of hospital-acquired vs community-acquired isolates was noted; 44 to 77% resistance of nosocomial Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. to second and third generation cephalosporins and 18% were resistant to amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae is currently the most common organism causing Gram-negative bacteremia in children. Because of the relatively high resistance of Gram-negative organisms to second and third generation cephalosporins, we suggest that empiric antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia include a combination of an aminoglycoside and an anti-Pseudomonas beta-lactam.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - Infections in children with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: an autopsy study of 30 cases in south Florida, 1990-1993.
AB  - Thirty autopsies performed on infants and children with HIV infection and/or AIDS were reviewed for the presence and type of infection. Twenty-six (87%) demonstrated evidence of infection in addition to HIV at the time of postmortem examination. Pathogenic bacterial infectious were the most frequently encountered, seen in 15 of the cases. Nine of the 15 (60%) were due to gram-negative rods, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infections with gram-negative organisms often involved multiple organ systems and were frequently undiagnosed both pre- and postmortem because of variability in culture results and difficulties in identification both clinically and in tissue sections. Discussion is presented of unusual staining characteristics and filamentous morphology found with these pathogens. Other pathogenic bacteria encountered were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., and Staphylococcus. Fungal infections due to Candida species were present in nine cases (31%) but were invasive in only two of these. One instance of Aspergillus meningo-encephalitis was noted. Proven viral infections were present in five children (three cytomegalovirus, one herpes simplex, and one adenovirus). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was diagnosed in five of the patients (17%), and one instance of disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare was encountered.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Urinary bacteriology of continent urinary reservoirs and calculus formation.
AB  - In order to investigate urinary bacteriology in relation to calculus formation in continent urinary reservoirs, a retrospective study was conducted of 19 patients with the Kock pouch and 23 patients with the Indiana pouch. Analysis of a total of 151 urine cultures showed that asymptomatic bacteria (any bacterial count) were present in 92% of urines from the Kock pouch and 74% from the Indiana pouch. The incidence of organisms and total bacterial counts were similar for both pouches. The most prevalent organisms were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., and Enterococcus sp. Urinary calculi developed in 42% of the Kock pouch patients and 13% of the Indiana pouch patients. More than half of the patients had multiple stone recurrence. Infectious stones developed in 32% of the Kock pouch patients, usually on the foreign materials, and 9% of the Indiana pouch patients. In general, no clear relationship was established between urinary bacteriology and calculus formation although Proteus sp. or Providencia sp. was determined to be the causative organism in some infectious stones. Furthermore, metabolic stones developed in 32% of the Kock pouch patients and 9% of the Indiana pouch patients. Because calcium phosphate was a constituent of 80% of the metabolic stones, the presence of urinary factors promoting calculus formation was suspected.
TI  - Antibiotics, biliary sepsis, and bile duct stones.
AB  - Bacteriologic studies of bile and blood cultures of 579 patients with ductal stones and infected bile revealed that 121 patients (21%) had associated bacteremia. Analysis of bile and stone cultures showed that Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Enterococcus sp, and Streptococcus sp were the most commonly isolated bacteria. Two-thirds of the patients with bacteremia had similar organisms isolated from blood and bile. Pharmacokinetic studies of the hepatic/biliary excretion profiles of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, imipenem, netilmicin, and ciprofloxacin were performed by ERCP and nasobiliary catheter drainage. The bile samples obtained immediately after cannulation from patients with complete biliary obstruction contained low or undetectable levels of the antibiotics administered--the exception being ciprofloxacin, which was present at a concentration of 20% of the serum level. In vitro determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of the aforementioned antibiotics against 199 isolates of biliary pathogens revealed imipenem and ciprofloxacin to have the highest antimicrobial activity. Based on pharmacokinetic studies and in vitro susceptibility findings, we conclude that ciprofloxacin is superior to the other tested antibiotics in prophylaxis and treatment of biliary sepsis.
TI  - Microbiological studies of abscesses complicating Bothrops snakebite in humans: a prospective study.
AB  - Forty patients with abscesses at the site of Bothrops bite were evaluated. Ten brought the snake responsible for the bite, Bothrops jararaca in all cases. On admission a sample was collected from each case for aerobic and anaerobic culture, and no abscesses drained spontaneously. None of the patients had received antibacterial therapy at this time. The bacteria most frequently isolated were Morganella morganii (23 patients), Providencia rettgeri (7) Enterobacter sp. (4), Escherichia coli (3), group D streptococcus (11) and Bacteroides sp. (6). All enterobacteria tested were sensitive to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and cefotaxime. Group D streptococci were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and penicillin G, whereas anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. These results suggest that in cases of abscess formation secondary to Bothrops bite, chloramphenicol alone is a good choice, being both safe and cheap.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - Isolation of Acanthamoeba sp. from a greyhound with pneumonia and granulomatous amebic encephalitis.
AB  - Acanthamoeba were isolated from a naturally occurring animal infection of granulomatous amebic encephalitis. The amebas were grown from lung lesions from a 1-year-old greyhound puppy, which was 1 of several dogs in a kennel that was affected by a progressive fatal neurologic and respiratory disease. The Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, confirmed the disease to be acanthamebiasis and specifically identified the amebas as Acanthamoeba culbertsoni by fluorescent antibody testing on brain tissue from the dog. The amebas were cultured initially on potato dextrose agar and on nonnutrient agar plates that were seeded with a lawn of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli. The isolate was then transferred to nonnutrient agar plates containing killed Enterobacter aerogenes and subsequently to axenic medium and cell cultures. The isolate was highly pathogenic by intranasal inoculation into 2-week-old mice.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative pBR322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  - Mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pBR322 and pBR325 was shown to occur between Escherichia coli K12 strains in LB-broth at 37 degrees C, provided a mobilizer plasmid (F') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. Evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of F'. It was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pBR325 from E. coli K12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both LB-broth and filtered seawater and that Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  - A prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. Intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. Of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. Wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. The figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. The commonest causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, Escherichia coli 16.9%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. When isolated intra-operatively, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound infection, but the intra-operative isolation of Bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.
TI  - Cloacal flora isolated from wild black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) in Laguna La Nacha, Mexico.
AB  - Cloacal swabs from 110 adult black-bellied whistling ducks trapped at Laguna La Nacha, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were cultured to determine the prevalence of normal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-five gram-negative enterobacteria and four gram-positive cocci were isolated. The most common isolates included Escherichia coli (54%), Staphylococcus spp. (29%), Streptococcus spp. (22%), Aeromonas hydrophila (15%) Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and Micrococcus sp. (14%). The implications of whistling ducks as possible reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria are discussed.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Desiccated rattlesnake capsules: a potential source of gram-negative bacterial infection].
AB  - The ingestion of rattlesnake powder capsules is frequent in Mexico in view of their alleged curative properties in various diseases, among them different malignancies. Based on previous reports showing both bacteremia and septicemia in patients with malignant diseases ingesting such capsules, we conducted a study to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in 16 different preparations of rattlesnake powder capsules, obtained in six different cities of our country. We found that all the samples were significantly contaminated with gram-negative coliform bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Salmonella arizona and Salmonella of groups B, E4 and G. Eighty one percent of the capsules were contaminated with Salmonella sp. The most frequent was S. arizona with a natural reservoir in snakes. Contamination was probably derived from both the flesh of the snake and fecal contamination during the domestic preparation of the powder to produce the capsules. These data, together with those previously published regarding bacteremia and septicemia derived from the ingestion of the capsules, suggests that there is danger in their use.
TI  - Aminoglycosides versus beta-lactams in gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  - Newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. Key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. There is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, Enterobacter sp, and Acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. At this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. Thus, combination therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Prevalence of nosocomial infections in a Saudi Arabian teaching hospital.
AB  - The rate of nosocomial infections was determined during a 9-month study in a 6-year-old hospital in north Saudi Arabia. The overall rate of nosocomial infection in the hospital was 2.2%. The rates in the different services varied. The highest were in the Special Care Baby Unit (13.5%) and Intensive Care Unit (6%). In the other services it ranged from 1 to 3.5%. The common causal agents of documented infections were Escherichia coli (81), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (55), Staphylococcus aureus (43), Klebsiella spp. (23), Candida spp. (15), Proteus spp. (14), enterococci (13), Enterobacter spp. (7), Acinetobacter spp. (2) and Providencia sp. (1). The most commonly infected sites from which these organisms were isolated were urine (133), wounds (48), umbilical cord (18), high vaginal infection (13), blood (11), burn respiratory tract infection (10 each).
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - A randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  - Febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a Hickman line-associated infection. At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp. (3), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2), Ent. adenocarboxylata (1), Clostridium septicum (1). Strept. B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - [Neonatal meningitis: observations on its etiology, mortality and sequelae].
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out on all cases diagnosed with neonatal meningitis at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez. A rate of 9.6 cases per 1,000 discharged patients was found as well as 6.7% association with sepsis. In 50 of the cases analyzed, an etiologic agent was identified in 23 children; the main bacteria identified were Escherichia coli (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterobacter (4%), Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas sp (2%), respectively. The mortality rate was 60% and sequelae were seen in 13 of the surviving 20 patients. The unfavorable prognosis of neonates with meningitis forces us to establish an early diagnosis, make every effort to identify the causing agent and try new medications as well as co-adjuvant treatments.
TI  - Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  - We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (Arthropoda).
AB  - The hemolymphs of two diplopod (Chicobolus sp. and Rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (Lithobius forficatus and Scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using Petri dish tests. The native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living Micrococcus luteus, whereas only Rhapidostreptus, Scolopendra, and Lithobius were effective against lyophilized Micrococcus. The antibacterial activity against living Micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in Chicobolus and Rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized Micrococcus in the latter. Thus, these effects appear to be inducible. None of the myriapods tested had any bacteriostatic effect on Escherichia coli D-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative E. cloacae was inhibited. The antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. At least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in Myriapoda.
TI  - [Identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  - Results of identification and classification of 204 strains of Gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. Among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including P. fluorescens (63), P. putida (9), P. maltophilia (12), P. putrefaciens (2), and P. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of Alcaligenes, both identified as A. denitrificans; 7 strains of Flavobacterium, including F. multovorum (3) and Flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of Acinetobacter, including A. lwoffi (7) and A. anitratus (2). Among 98 strains of fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; Escherichia (9), E. coli (12), Enterobacter Liquefaciens (31), Ent. cloacae (7), Ent. halfnia (8), Ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be ascertained.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on norfloxacin in pediatrics].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX, AM-715) is a new quinolone antibacterial agent. In the present study, we carried out laboratory and clinical investigations on NFLX in the field of pediatrics. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. NFLX was very active against Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. Antibacterial activities of NFLX against Gram-positive cocci were lower than those against Gram-negative rods but superior to activities of usual quinolone agents. MIC values of NFLX against Campylobacter jejuni were distributed in a range of less than or equal to 0.05-0.78 micrograms/ml. 2. A peak serum level of 0.49 micrograms/ml was observed in 2 subjects and its urinary recoveries were 13.7%, 21.5%, respectively. 3. Clinical efficacies to NFLX were excellent in 25 patients and good in 9 patients with a efficacy rate of 92%. In a bacteriological examination, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 87%. 4. No side effects were observed except eosinophilia in 1 patient. These findings indicate that NFLX will be useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - Microwave: practical cost-effective method for sterilizing urinary catheters in the home.
AB  - We used a standard microwave oven to sterilize red rubber catheters used for intermittent self-catheterization. Catheters were incubated for sixty minutes in a suspension of microorganisms isolated from the urine of patients with urinary tract infections. For each trial, 6 catheters were removed from their respective suspensions, placed in separate plastic freezer bags, distributed evenly in a microwave oven (avoiding cold spots), and microwaved simultaneously for twelve minutes. A control catheter was not microwaved. Two strains of each microorganism were tested. The urinary isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Candida sp. In each experiment, all 6 catheters were sterilized. Repeat sterilization in the microwave oven did not affect the integrity of the catheters or the plastic bags. A water heat sink of constant volume was employed. A home microwave oven may be used as a method to sterilize red rubber catheters for reuse with a recommended time of twelve minutes at full power. This technique makes aseptic intermittent self-catheterization a practical possibility.
TI  - Five years of cefotaxime use in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - In 1983 our antibiotic regimen for suspected neonatal septicemia was changed from amoxicillin-gentamicin to cefotaxime-amoxicillin. During the subsequent 5-year period we studied the effect of this change in regimen on the bacterial flora of the infants in the unit and the occurrence of serious infections. This was done with bacteriologic surveillance and analysis of the positive blood cultures from 1978 through 1987. A change in the relative numbers of isolated pathogens was observed; Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli decreased whereas Enterobacter sp. increased. The susceptibility of the Enterobacter isolates to cefamandole decreased from 85.3% in 1982 to 52.9% in 1983. The susceptibility of these bacteria to cefotaxime was 55.2% in 1983 and 55.0% in 1987. No change in susceptibilities to cefotaxime, amoxicillin or gentamicin was found in other pathogens. Although colonization with Enterobacter strains has increased and the susceptibility of these bacteria to the cephalosporins has decreased, the incidence of serious infections with Gram-negative bacteria decreased.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the oral cavity, fangs and venom of Bothrops jararaca: possible source of infection at the site of bite].
AB  - Culture of fang, fang sheath and venom of fifteen healthy freshly captured Bothrops jararaca were analyzed. The bacteria most frequently encountered were group D streptococci (12 snakes), Enterobacter sp. (6), Providencia rettgeri (6), Providencia sp. (4), Escherichia coli (4), Morganella morganii (3) and Clostridium sp. (5). The bacteria observed are similar to those found in the abscesses from Bothrops bitten patients. Since these snake mouth bacteria may be inoculated during the snake bite, bacterial multiplication and infection may occur under favorable conditions.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - [Impact of infections on mortality in children with cancer].
AB  - A study of the role infections play in the death of 29 children with cancer was conducted from 1983 to 1988. An infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of their death. The most frequently found etiological agents found in hemocultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp and Candida spp. A retrospective study on the role of infections in the death of children with cancer was conducted. The clinical and autopsy records of 29 children who died between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. Infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of death. The most frequent etiologic agents found in blood cultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  - A prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. All patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. In 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. In two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. Thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. Subsequently, 17 patients died. The cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. Micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens) and enterococci. Ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.
TI  - Evaluation of numerical analysis of SDS-PAGE of protein patterns for typing Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Twenty cultures comprising 13 clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae from two  hospitals, the type and another reference stain of E. cloacae and the type strains of four other Enterobacter sp. and of Escherichia coli, were characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins. The protein patterns were highly reproducible and were used as the basis of a numerical analysis which divided the clinical isolates into nine clearly defined protein types. Comparison with established typing methods indicated that the discrimination of SDS-PAGE was similar to that achieved with conventional typing methods and all strain groups recognized by combined sero/phage typing were also found by SDS-PAGE. In addition, protein typing sub-divided a group of four serotype O3 isolates that were difficult to distinguish by phage typing. We conclude that high-resolution SDS-PAGE of proteins provides an effective method of typing isolates of E. cloacae.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of biliary tract disease.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of the experiences of two military hospitals over 4 years in the recovery of organisms from biliary tract specimens was done. Bacterial growth was obtained in 123 bile specimens. Aerobic and facultative bacteria only were present in 59 specimens (48%), aerobic bacteria only were present in 4 specimens (3%), and mixed anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bacteria were present in 60 specimens (49%). Of 286 isolates recovered, 216 were aerobic or facultative (1.8 per specimen) and 70 were anaerobic (0.6 per specimen). The predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli (71 isolates), group D streptococci (42 isolates), Klebsiella sp. (29 isolates), Clostridium sp. (27 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (28 isolates), and Enterobacter sp. (16 isolates). Polymicrobial infections were present in 108 instances (88%). A higher recovery rate of anaerobes was present in patients with chronic infections than in those with acute infections and did not correlate with the presence of gallstones or use of antimicrobial prophylaxis.
TI  - [Studies on 145 cases of septicemia in infancy and childhood--especially on septicemic patients with malignant and hematological diseases].
AB  - Clinical and bacteriological data of 145 inpatients with septicemia, treated at the hospital of Chiba University School of Medicine from 1972 to 1987, were reviewed by dividing them into three stages. (stages I: 1972-76, stage II: 1978-82, stage III: 1983-87) Patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage III. Among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number. As to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. In stage III, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. In patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and Fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. In patients with other underlying diseases, S. aureus, CNS, and non Fermenters have been increasing. Among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. The decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin B as the drug of gut decontamination. The outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. During stage III, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. The introduction of the third generation cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. The prognosis was worst in the case of P. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage III. Coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of P. aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.
TI  - Castor-oil induced diarrhoea in ponies: a model for acute colitis.
AB  - A reproducible, reversible model of colitis induced in ponies by administering castor oil (2.5 ml/kg bodyweight [bwt] per os) was characterised by abdominal pain, fever, watery diarrhoea, dehydration, hypovolaemia, toxaemia, leucopenia, decreased serum Cl, Na and K levels and metabolic acidosis. The signs were most severe between 24 and 48 h post induction, stabilisation was frequently observed after 72 h, although diarrhoea could persist beyond 96 h. Morphological and in vitro transport studies (right ventral colon) were conducted on tissues from animals destroyed at 24, 48 and 72 h. In the caecum and colon, surface epithelial disruption and exfoliation from the basement membrane occurred between 24 and 48 h. Early signs of recovery were evident by replenishment of denuded areas with columnar epithelium at 72 h. The crypt epithelium was unaffected throughout the intestinal tract. In vitro transport studies were consistent with the morphological findings. Decreased Na-Cl absorption and normal Cl secretion indicated an impaired surface epithelium coincident with an undamaged cryptal epithelium. Increased mucosal permeability was demonstrated by high ionic conductance and large unidirectional isotopic fluxes. Tissue conductance improved during in vitro incubation suggesting epithelial repair after removal of castor oil. Changes in the population and proportion of bacteria in the faeces as diarrhoea ensued were confirmed at necropsy with a predominance of E. coli and Enterobacter/Klebsiella sp in the large bowel. The experimental induction of castor oil colitis showed many similarities to intestinal endotoxaemia and the secretory type diarrhoea encountered in naturally occurring acute colitis syndromes in horses. The model could prove applicable in studying the pathophysiological mechanisms precipitating such life-threatening disorders.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Product of the Lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  - Malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when L-malate is present in the medium. The activation of the malolactic system in Lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mleR. Induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mleR. The mleR gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the predicted MleR gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: LysR, IlvY gene products of Escherichia coli, MetR, CysB of Salmonella typhimurium, AmpR of Enterobacter cloacae, NodD of Rhizobium sp., and TrpI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of tigemonam dicholate (SQ 30836) and interaction with beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - SQ 30836 is an orally absorbed salt of tigemonam, a new monobactam similar to aztreonam in structure and microbiologic properties. When assayed against 400 clinical isolates, tigemonam's activity was similar to that of aztreonam and carumonam. It was highly effective against Enterobacteriaceae but showed poor activity against gram-positive organisms. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella strains at 0.5 micrograms/mL or less, and all Salmonella and Hafnia strains at 1 micrograms/mL or less. Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia strains were less susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC30] of 2, 32, and 8 micrograms/mL respectively). The activity of the new compound against Enterobacteriaceae is comparable with and often higher than that of third-generation cephalosporins and oral comparison compounds. In contrast to aztreonam, tigemonam had minimal activity against Pseudomonas sp and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. Data suggest that poor penetration through the outer membranes of Pseudomonas sp may be responsible for this failure. Tigemonam was stable to hydrolysis by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the Kl enzyme of Klebsiella and by the Proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. Also, measurement of the IC50 (concentration of inhibitor able to reduce the activity of the enzyme by 59%) showed that tigemonam has less affinity than aztreonam for class I cephalosporinases. However, only levels of beta-lactamase, not hydrolysis rates or affinity, correlated to MICs of the two monobactams for the resistant Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - [The rapid identification of E. coli by the detection of 3 enzymes].
AB  - 232 isolates of gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacteria, isolated from various samples of different animal species, were tested with help of RAPIDEC coli for the production of beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase and indole. The test correctly identified 164 of 175 E. coli strains (sensitivity 93.7%) and correctly indicated that 57 of 57 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (7 Citrobacter sp., 18 Enterobacter sp., 16 Klebsiella sp., 10 Proteus sp., 2 Providencia sp. and 4 Salmonella sp.) were not E. coli (specificity 100%).
TI  - Hospital-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  - From 16,534 admissions, 60 patients, 4 days to 15 years of age, with one or more  hospital-acquired urinary tract infections were identified during a 5-year period by a prospective surveillance system. The patient charts were subsequently reviewed to characterize the population at risk for such infections and to describe the course and consequences of these infections. Infections in individual patients ranged from one to greater than 50. The hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rate for the study period was 14.2 infections per 1,000 admissions. In the patients in whom all urinary tract infections were well documented, the following characteristics were defined: (1) 92% (97 of 105) of the infections occurred in catheterized patients; (2) almost half (49 of 105) of the infections occurred in patients exposed to only intermittent catheterization; (3) 28% (29 of 105) of the infections were asymptomatic; (4) fever was the most frequent finding in the symptomatic patients and occurred in 66% (60 of 105); (5) pyuria was found in only 51% (35 of 69) of the urinalyses performed at diagnosis; (6) 85% (89 of 105) of the infections were single-organism infections; (7) 82% (101 of 123) of the causative organisms were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp, Klebsiella spp, or Enterobacter sp. The urinary tract infections in the 60 patients were not complicated by bacteremia, and no direct relationship between the infections and the minimal mortality in our patients could be established.
TI  - Detection of antigens from gram-negative bacilli in urine of children with urinary tract infections. II. Thermostable bacterial proteins.
AB  - An enzyme immunoassay for detection of bacterial antigens in urine specimens from urinary tract infections (UTI) was developed. The antigens detected in infections by Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus sp. were different from the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA). They were digested by trypsin and were characterized by remarkable thermostability; their molecular weights were approximately 34,000 and 31,000. They were detected by means of antisera to ECA or to suspension of E. coli. The frequency of positive results with urine specimens from enterobacterial UTI was 87-99%. In contrast, the urine specimens of UTI by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were positive in fewer than 20% with anti-E. coli sera, but were positive in more than 85% in tests with antiserum to P. aeruginosa. The possible diagnostic application of the described tests was discussed.
TI  - [The rapid identification of Escherichia coli using Bactident E. coli].
AB  - 165 (93.7%) of 175 E. coli strains isolated from various materials of different animal species were correctly identified as E. coli with help of commercially available Bactident E. coli (E. Merck, D-6100 Darmstadt). Further 52 strains of the family of Enterobacteriaceae (2x Providencia sp., 2x Salmonella sp., 7 Citrobacter sp., 9 Proteus sp., 15 Klebsiella sp., 17 Enterobacter sp.) were correctly not identified as E. coli by this test. Bactident E. coli is a suitable test for rapid identification of E. coli in veterinary bacteriology.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of KY-109, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial potencies of KY-109, a pro-drug of KY-087, were compared with those of amoxicillin, cephalexin (CEX), and cefaclor (CCL). The following results were obtained. KY-087, which is the active form of KY-109, had broad antimicrobial spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, but showed low antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter sp., Serratia, and Pseudomonas sp. The antimicrobial activities of KY-087 against clinically isolated Gram-positive organisms were superior to those of CEX and CCL. The antimicrobial activities of KY-087 against Gram-negative organisms, such as Enterobacter sp., Serratia, and Pseudomonas sp., were less active. KY-087 showed dose-related bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The therapeutic efficacy of KY-109 against experimental intraperitoneal infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms in mice was comparable to that of CEX but inferior to that of CCL. In experimental granuloma pouch models in rats and kidney infection in rabbits, therapeutic efficacy of KY-109 was either comparable or superior to that of CEX and CCL.
TI  - Lipid A precursor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
AB  - Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) caused accumulation of a lipid A precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid A of mature LPS. The enzyme CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase) from P. aeruginosa is inhibited by the KDO analog alpha-C-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-D-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (I), and I is effectively delivered to P. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (I) which then inhibits activation of KDO by CMP-KDO synthetase causing accumulation of lipid A precursor and subsequent growth stasis. The major lipid A precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, C12:O, 2OH-C12:O and 3OH-C10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3OH-C12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. Analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (M - H)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid A from P. aeruginosa. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid A precursors which only contained 3-OH-C14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. This difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid A are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Carumonam's in-vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria and its stability to their beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel monobactam carumonam (RO17-2301) was evaluated on 311 gram-negative clinical isolates in comparison to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotetan and ceftriaxone. Carumonam showed an antibacterial potency equal to or higher than any other reference compound; in particular it was the most effective against Proteus indole positive and Klebsiella sp. Its antipseudomonal activity was comparable to that of ceftazidime and it showed, together with aztreonam, the highest activity against the Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Escherichia coli isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations performed on permeability altered organisms indicated that carumonam has a penetration rate comparable to aztreonam and higher than cefotetan and ceftriaxone. Carumonam demonstrated excellent stability to chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and that correlated with its antibacterial activity against the producing strains and inoculum size effect.
TI  - Species-related differences in the incidence of gram-negative bacteria isolated from the cloaca of clinically normal psittacine birds.
AB  - Cloacal swabs from 506 clinically normal psittacine birds of 22 species were aerobically cultured for bacteria and yeasts. In 45 (9%) samples, no microbial organisms were recovered. Gram-positive bacteria were recovered from 474 (91%) samples. The incidences of gram-negative bacteria and yeasts were: Escherichia coli 157 (31%), Enterobacter sp. 21 (4%), Klebsiella sp. 3 (0.6%), Pseudomonas sp. 4 (0.8%), and yeasts 26 (5%). Differences were noted in the recovery rate of E. coli among the various species of birds cultured. Escherichia coli was recovered from 101 of 168 cockatoos (60%) of the genus Cacatua but from only 18% of 338 non-Cacatua species. As all birds were housed in the same facility under similar conditions, this difference in the incidence rate of E. coli cannot be explained on the basis of differences in husbandry or diet alone.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - A morphological study of the action of equine anti-lipopolysaccharide plasma on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Three strains of gram-negative bacteria--one each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter sp.--were treated with anti-lipopolysaccharide hyperimmune equine plasma (anti-LPS) or non-immune control plasma and examined by scanning electronmicroscopy. Within a few minutes of treatment with anti-LPS, bacteria were agglutinated. Evidence of cell membrane destruction was observed shortly thereafter and total cell disintegration and disruption occurred within 1-2 h. In contrast, non-immune plasma had no effect on cell morphology. This confirms the findings in previous microbiological studies that specific antibodies in anti-LPS bind to lipopolysaccharide (LPS endotoxin), and thereby initiate the destruction of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro activities of 7 antimicrobial agents against organisms (474 strains) isolated from patients with various infections in Ehime University Hospital from May to July 1986 were investigated. Summarized results are as follows: 1. Aztreonam (AZT) showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 2. Antimicrobial activities of AZT were especially superior against Proteus sp. to the third generation cephem antibiotics. 3. Enterobacter sp. seemed more susceptible to AZT than to cephem antibiotics, but minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT against may isolates of Enterobacter sp. were in wide ranges.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Absence of a role for lytic microorganisms in the decline of bacteria andSaccharomyces introduced into soil.
AB  - The populations ofKlebsieila pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, andPseudomonas sp. fell following their addition to soil, but species lysing these gram-negative bacteria were not detected. The numbers ofStaphylococcus aureus andMicrococcus flavus fell by more than four orders of magnitude and ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae by more than two orders after their addition to soil. Organisms lysing these gram-positive bacteria were present in soil, but their numbers did not increase as a result of the additions. Lytic activity againstS. aureus was detected in soil filtrates, but this activity was not enhanced by inoculation of soil with the bacterium. Addition of cycloheximide to soil suspensions delayed the fall in abundance ofM. flavus but did not suppress the lytic populations. We conclude that lysis is not responsible for the decline of bacteria orS. cerevisiae added to soil.
TI  - Susceptibility of gentamicin sensitive and resistant gram negative bacilli to ceftazidime.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with other third-generation cephalosporins and gentamicin against 409 isolates. Ceftazidime was the most active agent against Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp., Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was less active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than moxalactam and cefotaxime but more active than cefoperazone. Against gentamicin resistant E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime was more active than moxalactam, cefotaxime or cefoperazone but was as active as moxalactam against gentamicin-resistant Proteus sp. and more active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
TI  - Occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance and R-plasmids in gram-negative bacteria isolated from faecally contaminated fresh-water streams in Hong Kong.
AB  - The bacterial populations of six freshwater streams in populated areas of the Hong Kong New Territories were studied. There is considerable faecal contamination of these streams, with coliform counts as high as 10(5) c.f.u./ml and the contaminating organisms show a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance and multiple resistance. With direct plating of water samples onto antibiotic-containing media, an average of 49% of the gram-negative bacteria were ampicillin-resistant, 3% chloramphenicol-resistant and 1% gentamicin-resistant. At individual sites resistance to these drugs was as high as 98%, 8% and 3% respectively. More than 70% of strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics, 29% to five or more and 2% to eight or more. A total of 98 patterns of antibiotic resistance were detected with no one pattern predominating. Twenty-eight gram-negative bacterial species were identified as stream contaminants. Escherichia coli was the commonest bacterial species isolated and other frequent isolates were Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp., but no enteric pathogens were detected. The greatest prevalence of resistance and multiple resistance was associated with the heaviest contamination by E. coli. Analysis of selected stream isolates revealed multiple plasmid bands arranged in many different patterns, but multiple antibiotic resistances were shown to be commonly mediated by single transferable plasmids. Faecally-contaminated freshwater streams in Hong Kong may be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance plasmids for clinically-important bacteria.
TI  - Differences in antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates in Saudi Arabia and the United States.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of 3,530 clinical isolates at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH), in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were compared with those of 11,041 bacterial isolates at two hospitals of comparable size in the United States. The gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, Proteus-Morganella group, Enterobacter sp, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally more resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at KFSH than in the United States. A larger number of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were more resistant to cephalosporin, chloramphenical, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at one of the tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Hemophilus influenzae and gram-positive cocci exhibited similar susceptibilities toward commonly used antibiotics at all three institutions.
TI  - A comparative study of the sensitivity of bacteria of various origin to ofloxacin.
AB  - The sensitivity of 6 antimicrobials (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cephalothin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin) was tested on 174 bacteria isolated from three sources: 60 from wounds, 84 from urine and 30 from bronchial excretions. Hospital-borne bacteria were compared to those of non-hospital origin for their susceptibility. Consecutively, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 strains), Escherichia coli (58), Klebsiella sp. (13), Enterobacter sp. (3), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterococcus sp. (25) and Staphylococcus sp. (48) were tested. With the exception of 7.1% of bacteria (Enterococcus) isolated from urine, 96.6% of all strains tested were sensitive to ofloxacin.
TI  - Utero-ovarian infection in aged B6C3F1 mice.
AB  - An unusually high number of ovarian masses and cysts with purulent material were  observed in the B6C3F1 mice on 2 year chemical carcinogenicity studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute-National Toxicology Program. To determine possible etiology, some of these lesions were cultured for bacteria and a majority yielded Klebsiella sp. Necropsy records of 14,029 female mice in 91 chronic studies necropsied from 1979 to 1983 at six toxicology testing laboratories were reviewed to determine the incidence of lesions and distribution of this disease. Animals for these studies were obtained from barrier production colonies of six suppliers. The incidence of this lesion was low in animals less than 14 months of age, increased with age and reached a peak in 24-26 month old mice. Most animals having this lesion either died or were sacrificed in moribund condition, indicating that this is a life shortening disease of aged B6C3F1 mice. The incidence of lesions ranged from less than 1% to 70% in different chronic studies. There was a marked difference in the incidence in mice from different suppliers and the incidence rate was 2.6 to 15% depending on the source of the animals. The incidence of this lesion in some testing laboratories was several-fold higher than in others and ranged from 0.9 to 20%. The proportion of mice with this lesion was low in some laboratories irrespective of the source of the animals, whereas in other laboratories the incidence was several-fold higher with animals from some, but not all suppliers, indicating testing laboratory-supplier interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Use of tannic acid for the ultrastructural visualization of periplasm in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tannic acid mordanting reveals the periplasm, the area between the outer membrane and the inner membrane of gram-negative bacteria, Rhizobium sp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes, as an electron-dense layer continuous with the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. The method involves 18 hr of tannic acid treatment after fixation in aldehyde prior to osmium tetroxide postfixation, followed by conventional electron microscopy.
TI  - Microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  - Patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. These infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. Often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. With treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent; however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. Bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Among the aerobic gram-positive organisms, several varieties of streptococci such as Group B streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. Staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen. Among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is Escherichia coli. Klebsiella sp. and Proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. Species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. Among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are Peptostreptococci and Peptococci. Clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. Among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the Bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens. Bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. Other organisms encountered are Chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.
TI  - Premarket evaluation of IDS RapID SS/u system for identification of urine isolates.
AB  - A total of 170 fresh clinical urine isolates were tested with a premarket configuration of the RapID SS/u system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.), a qualitative micromethod for the identification of selected organisms commonly isolated from urine specimens. Results were compared with those obtained with conventional methods of identifying gram-positive isolates and with the AutoMicrobic system (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.), utilizing Gram-Negative Identification cards for the identification of gram-negative rods. Organisms representing 12 taxa were included in the study. Of the 170 isolates, 163 (95.9%) were correctly identified. A total of 144 strains (84.7%) were correctly identified without additional testing, whereas 19 isolates (11.2%) required further testing. Seven isolates (4.1%) were incorrectly identified. The SS/u system required minimal hands-on time inoculate and interpret reactions. Discrepancies most often occurred with regard to misinterpretation of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp. as Citrobacter sp. The IDS RapID SS/u system may indeed prove valuable for the rapid manual identification of urine isolates.
TI  - [Pyogenic hepatic abscess].
AB  - Ten patients, 6 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 53 years, having pyogenic liver abscess, were studied to review the principal features of the clinical and bacteriological diagnosis. In 9 cases the abscess was located in the right hepatic lobe. Bacteriological diagnosis was made in 6 cases: the etiology was nonmicrobian in 3 and two microorganisms were found in the other 3 cases. The isolated pathogens were: Escherichia coli (3 cases), Staphylococcus sp (3 cases), Enterobacter agglomerans (1 case), Citrobacter sp (1 case), Streptococcus sp (1 case). The basic clinical pattern included fever in 9 patients, pain in upper right side of the abdomen in 8, jaundice in 5 and respiratory symptoms in 5. In 2 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography, in 2 by scintigraphy and in 3 both methods were used. Surgical drainage was practiced in 7 patients, with favorable course in 6. Three patients were not operated; 2 died and the third was cured with medical treatment. The importance of the clinical suspicion even with few data is pointed out, specially prolonged fever with painful syndrome in upper right side of the abdomen. The aid of the diagnosis imaging is valuable for verification. The precise bacteriological diagnosis by culture of the material obtained in surgery or by percutaneous drainage of the abscess allows the selection of the most suitable antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Osteoarticular infections in children with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. There were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - Microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. All patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. The most common organisms cultured were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, Candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, Enterobacter, 16 cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. The classic isolates, Escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. To determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. Candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and S. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. The spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those with acute peritonitis. Despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.
TI  - Susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: E. coli (n = 50), Enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and streptococci (n = 51). The results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. Considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.
TI  - BRL-36650: in vitro studies and assessment of serum bactericidal activity after single-dose administration in volunteers.
AB  - Ten healthy volunteers received 1 g of BRL-36650, a new formamido-penicillin derivative, given by intravenous infusion over 15 min. Levels in serum were measured microbiologically 30, 60, and 120 min after the start of the 15-min infusion and were (mean +/- standard deviation) 102.7 +/- 28.4, 59.7 +/- 11.5, and 9.6 +/- 1.9 mg/liter, respectively. A total of 10 strains each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia spp., and Enterobacter spp. and 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were selected according to their susceptibility or resistance to piperacillin for the study of serum bactericidal activity (SBA). The MICs and MBCs of these strains were influenced by the choice of medium. Median SBA against E. coli and K. pneumoniae were greater than or equal to 1:2,048 and 1:512, respectively. The SBA against piperacillin-susceptible Serratia spp. (1:256), Enterobacter spp. (1:128), and P. aeruginosa (1:32) were significantly higher than against piperacillin-resistant strains (1:32, 1:8, and 1:4, respectively). Killing curves confirmed the high bactericidal activities obtained against the majority of strains. In the case of one Enterobacter sp. and one P. aeruginosa isolate with an MBC greater than or equal to 32, the absence of killing was noted.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and conjugative R plasmids in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae in Peninsular Malaysia.
AB  - Twenty-five strains of enterobacteria, isolated from man in Peninsular Malaysia and consisting of seven Enterobacter spp., five Escherichia coli, five Salmonella spp., four Klebsiella spp., two Shigella spp., one Proteus sp. and and one Providencia sp., were tested for antibiotic resistance and conjugative R plasmids. They were all sensitive to nalidixic acid and resistant to at least three antibiotics. The number of resistances ranged from 3 to 11 antibiotics, including cefoperazone and sisomicin (two) newly released antibiotics), in addition to common drugs of current use. Of the 25 isolates, 19 (76%) conjugally transferred, at varied frequencies, at least two resistance determinants. Results from equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, agarose gel electrophoresis and transformation experiments provided proof that the transferable resistances were plasmid-mediated. Restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns showed that the plasmids from Proteus strain K005 and Providencia strain K001 may be identical.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - [Effects of KS-R1 (ampicillin suppository) and ampicillin oral dosing on fecal flora of children].
AB  - A newly developed product, KS-R1 (a suppository containing 250 mg potency of ampicillin (ABPC)), was given to 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) ranging from 4 years and 5 months to 8 years and 10 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 62.4 mg/kg) for 5 days. As a control, the same amount of ABPC dry syrup was given orally to 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls) ranging from 2 years and 8 months to 7 years and 7 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 55.3 mg/kg) for 5 days. The effects of these 2 preparations on the bacterial flora of the feces were investigated, and concentrations of ABPC in the feces and sensitivities of the isolated strains to ABPC were determined. The results were as follows. As for Gram-negative bacilli in the feces from children given KS-R1, there was no change in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. which were isolated from many children 3 days after the end of treatment, but they did not show any constant pattern of change in mean number. Other species did not show any pattern of increase in the number of children from whom they were isolated, or in the number of bacteria during the course after the beginning of treatment. The total number of bacteria identified as Enterobacteriaceae was at the level of 10(8) cells/g on any day of examination. Of Gram-negative bacilli other than Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas sp. showed no constant pattern of change in number. On the other hand, of Gram-positive bacteria, there was no constant pattern of change in the number of Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci began to be isolated from many children 5 days after the beginning of treatment and were isolated from all children 5 days after the end of treatment, but there was no tendency for the mean number to increase. Enterococcus sp. was not isolated from 3 children 3 days after the beginning of treatment, and was decreased in number by one order in 3 out of other 4 children as compared with before-treatment. However, this species was isolated from all children 3 days after the end of treatment, and the mean number of bacteria was similar to that before-treatment although the number of bacteria was different in individual children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cross resistance of quinolone derivatives in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A total of 127 Gram-negative bacteria resistant to nalidixic acid were isolated from as many patients affected by urinary tract infections and hospitalized in the first Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Naples. Enterobacteria were identified by Enterotube system (Roche) and API 20 system (Ayerst). Non-fermentative bacteria were identified by OXI/FERM system (Roche). The following bacteria were collected: Escherichia coli 50, Proteus spp. 35, Enterobacter agglomerans 12, Serratia sp. 5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25. The in vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and three other quinoline derivatives (pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid and ciprofloxacin) were studied by determining the MICs by a miniaturized dilution broth method. The MICs were compared to evaluate the eventual cross resistance to the drugs under examination within each bacterial species. The results showed that 23% of bacteria were resistant to nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid and oxolinic acid; 49.6% to nalidixic and pipemidic acid and 0.7% to nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid. On the other hand none of the bacteria were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The last showed very low MICs against all the bacteria under examination, including Pseudomonas and Serratia. The high antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin even against bacteria highly resistant to the other quinolines could be due to a greater affinity of the target sites or to the better permeability of resistant strains to the newer drug or because it is unaffected until now by mutations of genes responsible for cross resistance.
TI  - Bacteraemia at the University Hospital of the West Indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  - A total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the University Hospital of the West Indies between June 1982 and June 1983. This gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. The 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 Gram-positive and 133 Gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. Highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over 50 years of age. Septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms was predominantly a disease of children whereas that caused by Gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. A predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. The most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. Most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to the departments of medicine or paediatrics. There were 11 cases of polymicrobial septicaemia caused predominantly by Gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. Appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. In those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. Forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia. Mortality from septicaemia caused by Gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by Gram-positive organisms. The organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were Escherichia coli, 53%; Enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. There were no deaths from septicaemia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. or Serratia sp. The highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - Amifloxacin activity against well-defined gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Amifloxacin (WIN 49375) activity against a well-defined group of gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli was compared with the activity of 11 other antimicrobial agents. For all strains, amifloxacin and norfloxacin were the most active agents, followed by cefotaxime and moxalactam. For Acinetobacter sp. only amifloxacin had an achievable MIC for 90% of the strains. Amifloxacin joins other newly developed DNA gyrase inhibitors as potentially useful agents for infections due to aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, a new carboxyquinoline antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin (Bay o 9867), a new carboxyquinoline antimicrobial agent, was compared with those of norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, and several other oral and parenteral antimicrobial agents. Ciprofloxacin was substantially more active than nalidixic acid or cinoxacin against all gram-negative bacteria tested. Virtually all strains of Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by the new drug at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin was more active than norfloxacin against Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Serratia marcescens, and it was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). The new drug also demonstrated significant activity against gram-positive cocci, inhibiting all strains of staphylococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was bactericidal at concentrations near the MIC against most isolates tested. Although stepwise increases in resistance were seen with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa during serial passage on plates containing incremental concentrations of the drug, significant resistance did not emerge during incubation of strains in broth containing concentrations of ciprofloxacin above the MBC.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  - The combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of D-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. The results showed that all five strains of Escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. Similar results were obtained with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Within the Salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the E. coli strains. The combining sites of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of Salmonella sp. and E. coli. The results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.
TI  - Bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  - The membrane filter (MF) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified Endo medium at 35 degrees C for 22 h. Large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (SPC) technique, can interfere with the detection of coliforms on MF. This paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific SPC bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on MF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in Escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. The Flavobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. selected for this study from SPC did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. Excessive crowding of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae colonies on MF also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. Even when there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the E. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified Endo medium.
TI  - Inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. The minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by Proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), Enterobacter sp and Citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), Providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). When compared with the ranges of activity of seven reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for P aeruginosa, Citrobacter sp, Proteus sp, and A calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against Enterobacter sp. For amikacin-resistant P aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. The MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of amifloxacin were similar. For all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.
TI  - Multicenter clinical trials of cefoperazone in Japan.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated at 149 institutions in Japan. A total of 979 hospitalized patients were treated with cefoperazone alone for 1,059 infections. In the 984 infections evaluated, there was an overall satisfactory clinical response in 824 (83.7%). Cefoperazone was effective in 83.0% of the respiratory tract infections, 84.9% of urinary tract infections, and 89.6% of hepatobiliary tract infections. Clinical response was satisfactory in 90% or more of the cases in which Escherichia coli, Serratia sp, Haemophilus influenzae or Staphylococcus sp were isolated. Sixty percent to 90% of the infections with Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. Cefoperazone was effective in 76.2% of 260 evaluated cases that had failed to respond to prior treatment with other cephalosporins. The adverse reactions that occurred in 19 (1.9%) of the 979 patients included rash (1%), diarrhea (0.6%), and fever (0.4%). Cefoperazone appears to be extremely useful in the treatment of various infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Urinary tract infection and drug-resistant bacteria in different patient populations.
AB  - A 1-year survey of the pathogens causing urinary tract infections was conducted in three institutions: a rehabilitation hospital, a general hospital and outpatient clinics. Gram-negative rods accounted for 96% of the infections. In the general hospital and the outpatient clinics, Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen, while Proteus sp. were most prevalent in the rehabilitation hospital. The frequency of drug-resistant isolates was significantly higher in the rehabilitation hospital than in the general hospital and the outpatient clinics. This was most conspicuous in the use of the beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides against such organisms as E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and Proteus sp. Urinary E. coli were more sensitive to antimicrobial drugs than were other urinary pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were highly resistant to most antibiotics. About half of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin and another half to carbenicillin. In some instances the frequency of drug-resistant isolates was higher in the general hospital than in the outpatient clinics, reflecting the greater usage of antimicrobials in the general hospital.
TI  - In vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas sp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. The majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. Although most Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and Bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. Activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. Enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. Enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid pH than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. There was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. Resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Plasmids encoding trimethoprim resistance in bacterial isolates from man and pigs.
AB  - Trimethoprim (Tp) resistant Gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and  pigs. The bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. The presence of transferable Tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. The Tp R-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as Tc, Cm, Sp, Sm and Su. Incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, Inc FIV and Inc N. Thirty of 99 Tp R-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as Inc FIV and eight as Inc N. The results of molecular weight determination of Tp R-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger R-plasmids (76 to 104 Md) belonging to Inc FIV and lower molecular weight R-plasmids (25 to 35 Md) belonging to Inc N. Results from this study indicate that the Tp R-plasmids isolated in Perth have evolved independently from those described in Europe and the United Kingdom. There is also evidence for their local spread between Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter from man and animals.
TI  - The relationship of disc position to zone-of-inhibition size in the disc-agar diffusion test.
AB  - One hundred sixteen clinical isolates of Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were tested against cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefamandole and piperacillin by disc-agar diffusion. Zones-of-inhibition of discs dropped near the center of the plate were compared with those dropped near the periphery. In 28% of the comparisons the inner and outer zones differed by 2 mm or more. Of those, the inner zone was larger 2.5 times more often than the outer zone. Results suggest that the chances of obtaining a susceptible result are greater when discs are placed near the center as opposed to the periphery of the plate.
TI  - [Polymicrobial endocarditis. Report of a case and review of the literature].
AB  - We describe a case of polimicrobial endocarditis in a patient with congenital aortic stenosis and end-stage renal failure in treatment with steroids and chronic haemodialisis. The blood culture grew e.coli, enterobacter sp, and s.epidermidis. Only a few papers in the literature have been devoted to this entity. Its frequency seems to be progressively higher. The present case is a good example to talk about the predisponent factors. The review of literature has shown that the occurrence of this entity is specially high among addicts, the most frequent bacteria are s.aureus, streptococci and pseudomonas and the mortality can be as high as 80%.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - Hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel.
AB  - A quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. Overall, 31% of health care workers carried aerobic Gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (P < 0.001). Enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other Enterobacter spp. 7%. Other organisms included Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, Serratia spp. 11%, Klebsiella spp. 10%, Moraxella spp. 3%, Pseudomonas spp. 3%, Proteus spp. 1.5%, Escherichia coli 1%; Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas sp. and an isolate that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. We conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. Enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Coliform inhibition by bacteriocin-like substances in drinking water distribution systems.
AB  - Bacterial isolates from an unchlorinated potable groundwater system and a chlorinated surface water system were screened by an agar overlay method for the ability to produce bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) inhibitory to the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Enterobacter aerogenes. The production of coliform-specific BLS by noncoliform bacteria varied with the site and date of isolation as well as the genus of the producer strain. A total of 448 bacterial isolates were screened from the chlorinated system, and 22.1% produced BLS specific for at least one of the three coliforms. In the unchlorinated system, 7.9% (n = 696) possessed this ability. Flavobacterium/Moraxella comprised 57.1% of all bacteria (from both systems) producing BLS. The possibility that BLS interfere with coliform detection in standard bacteriological water quality tests is discussed.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cutaneous abscesses in children.
AB  - Specimens from 209 cutaneous abscesses in children were cultured for aerobic and  anaerobic microorganisms. Of these, nine (4%) were sterile and 51 (24%) yielded pure cultures that were predominantly Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. The data were organized according to these anatomic locations: head, neck, trunk, finger, nailbed, hand, leg, buttocks, perirectal, and vulvovaginal areas. Aerobic bacteria only were present in 92 specimens (46%), anaerobes only were isolated in 52 (26%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 56 abscesses (28%). A total of 467 isolates (270 anaerobes and 197 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.3 anaerobes and 1.0 aerobes). The presence of more than one anaerobe per abscess was obtained from the vulvo-vaginal, buttocks, perirectal, finger, nailbed, and head areas. Aerobes were more prevalent in the neck, hand, leg, and trunk areas. The predominant aerobes recovered were: S aureus (89 isolates), alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci (29), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (16), Enterobacter (10), and Escherichia coli (8). The predominant anaerobes recovered were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (79 isolates), Bacteroides sp (116, including 31 B melaninogenicus group and 29 B fragilis group), and Fusobacterium sp (39). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cutaneous abscesses in children in perirectal, head, finger, and nailbed areas.
TI  - Synergistic effect of cephalexin with mecillinam.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo synergistic effects of cephalexin and mecillinam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and Proteus sp. were demonstrated and their action mechanism were also discussed. The growth curve after the exposure of cephalexin and mecillinam at the concentrations at which these antibiotics had no effects when given alone showed a decreased of the turbidity and the presence of a bactericidal effect. In experimental infection in mice, the combination of both drugs showed a synergistic effect and excellent therapeutic effect. The blood concentration ratio of cephalexin to mecillinam was coincident with the concentration ratio of these antibiotics at which the synergistic effect was observed in vitro. Phase-contrast and scanning electron somewhat elongated bacteria and formation of spindle cells with swelling in the central part. A leakage of the cellular contents from part of the swelled cell wall was observed by transmission electron microscope. Cephalexin showed an affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)-1a and 3 in Escherichia coli and mecillinam showed an affinity for PBP-2. When these antibiotics were used concurrently, they exerted an additive effect to increase the affinity for PBPs. The lytic activity was increased much more after the combination of two antibiotics than after a single exposure.
TI  - Poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects RNA from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
AB  - Short lengths (18 residues) of poly(A), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of RNAases (ribonucleases) from Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. As the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. Furthermore, poly(A) sequences, present only on a small subpopulation of RNA, and accounting for less than 1% of total RNA, serve to protect all RNA, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. The quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. The exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(A) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. Comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of RNAase activity, by using linked poly(A) and similar quantities of free poly(A), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits RNAase activity, covalent linkage of poly(A) to RNA is more advantageous to the stability of an RNA substrate. However, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(A) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.
TI  - Chemical structure and inhalation toxicity of lipopolysaccharides from bacteria on cotton.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides from different bacteria isolated from cotton were purified and chemically analyzed. Their pulmonary toxicity to animals was tested in inhalation tests. Lipopolysaccharides from Agrobacterium and Xanthomonas were shown to differ from the others in that they contained no heptose and no non-hydroxylated fatty acids with a chain length of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms. Lipopolysaccharides from Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Klebsiella oxytoca were found to cause an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the airways. Lipopolysaccharides from Agrobacterium sp. and Xanthomonas sinensis caused no significant invasion. The data point to substances in both the lipid A part and the core part of the lipopolysaccharides being responsible for the capacity to induce leukocyte invasion into the airways.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Association of human enteric pathogenicity and mouse lung toxicity of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Mouse lung toxicity of 439 strains (431 Escherichia coli, 1 Shigella dysenteriae  1, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Vibrio sp., 1 Klebsiella) was compared to other pathogenicity tests (mouse virulence, enterotoxicity, guinea pig eye test), to serogroup distribution, loss of virulence on storage, origin and haemolytic activity. Mouse lethality was highest in serogroup O4 (p < 0.001), O18a,c (p < 0.001); serogroups O6, O20, O75, O115, O147 were next in order. E. coli serogroups O19, O26, O28a,b, O32, O51, O53, O55, O73, O78, O79, O83, O105, O111, O112, O114, O117, O119, O124, O129, O136, O142 failed to show lung toxicity. Strains O4 and O18 isolated at different periods of time did not differ significantly in the lung test (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, p > 0.1, p = 0.05, p > 0.1). There was no significant difference between strains isolated from the stools of patients with enteritis and of healthy individuals (p = 0.1, p > 0.99) and between those isolated from all faecal specimens and from extraintestinal samples (p = 0.05, p > 0.3). There was no correlation between lung toxicity and other pathogenicity tests. Since strains isolated from healthy individuals were also toxic for mice, a positive lung test cannot be considered a criterion of the aetiological role of the agent.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin, piperacillin, Bay k 4999 with carbenicillin and ticarcillin against enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of five penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and Bay k 4999) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole positive Proteus sp. and Enterobacter species was determined by an agar dilution method. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were found to be the most active of the semi-synthetic penicillins tested against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Bay k 4999 was slightly more active than piperacillin against E. coli, about as active as piperacillin against Pseudomonas, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus, but more active than piperacillin against Enterobacter species.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.
TI  - The Automicrobic System for urines.
AB  - An evaluation of the Automicrobic System (AMS) for Urines (Vitek Systems, Inc.) was carried out under the auspices of the Product Evaluation Committee of the College of American Pathologists from the period June 1977 through October 1978. Data generated during this evaluation indicated that, when comparing the AMS methodology to our clinical microbiology laboratory methodology, a 37% time saving could be realized by utilizing the AMS. Quantitation with the AMS showed a 99% correlation with the clinical microbiology laboratory method except for yeast which correlated only 50% of the time. The average overall identification accuracy was 95%. Negative response accuracy was 99%. Other members of the Enterobacteriaceae which the instrument is not designed to identify may produce erroneous results if they occur in urine specimens. Specimens containing two organisms were identified with a 94% correlation when compared to our conventional methodology. The time when a well becomes positive may be used as a fairly reliable indicator of significance (count greater than 70,000 colony-forming units per ml) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, and group D Enterococcus, but not for Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeast. Specimen collection must be performed properly since specimens considered as contaminated by conventional plating-out techniques may be reported out by the AMS as only one or two organisms and thus lead to an erroneous assumption as to significance. Cost per specimen was $1.83 more by utilizing the AMS method as compared to our conventional method. This is offset by a saving of 1.74 h daily of personnel time and a final report in 13 h. At least 30 urine specimens would be needed daily to pay for the instrument and specimen costs in 1 year. The AMS can provide significant aid to a clinical microbiology laboratory when all factors are considered.
TI  - Comparison of direct and standard antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing for bacteria isolated from blood.
AB  - To determine the reliability of early antimicrobial susceptibility testing, we compared the results of direct and standard single-disk diffusion methods for 581 positive blood cultures processed routinely by the clinical microbiology laboratory. The direct procedure differed from the standard one only in that the 0.5 McFarland inoculum was prepared from 1 ml of turbid broth rather than five isolated colonies from a subculture plate. A major discrepancy in results was defined as a change from susceptible to resistant or vice versa according to interpretive standards for zone diameters, whereas a minor discrepancy was defined as a shift to or from the intermediate category when paired direct and standard tests were compared. The overall agreement between the two methods was 94.6% of 2,308 comparisons. There were 119 minor (5.2%) and 6 major (0.3%) discrepancies. The major discrepancies were seen with three strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and one strain each of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter sp. Direct susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures that were pure by gram-stained smear provided reliable results 24 to 36 h earlier than conventional procedures; therefore, we recommended this procedure to guide early antimicrobial therapy in patients with bacterial sepsis.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - The activity of LY127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. LY127935 exhibited striking activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., Serratia marcescens, and B. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was somewhat less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus. Cefotaxime (HR 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against B. fragilis. LY127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Pharyngeal colonization by gram-negative bacilli in aspiration-prone persons.
AB  - We compared the prevalence of Gram-negative bacilli in the pharyngeal flora of two groups of patients with a known predilection for Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia (chronic alcoholics and diabetics), two other groups of aspiration-prone persons with no known predilection for Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia (epileptics and narcotic addicts), and normal control subjects. Quantitative cultures of saline gargles showed pharyngeal Gram-negative bacilli to be significantly (P less than .05) more prevalent among alcoholics (35%) and diabetics (36%) but not epileptics (17%) or addicts (20%) than controls (18%). Counts of greater than or equal to 100 Gram-negative bacilli per milliliter were also significantly more common in alcoholics (14%) and diabetics (24%) than controls (5%, P less than .05). Enterobacter sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were the most common Gram-negative bacilli isolated. Increased colonization by Gram-negative bacilli might be a factor contributing to the propensity of alcoholics and diabetics for Gram-negative pneumonia.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - The effects of temperature and growth rate on the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in bacterial lipids.
AB  - The effects of temperature and growth rate on the fatty acid composition of the extractable lipids of four mesophilic and three psychotrophic bacteria were examined. Two of the mesophiles (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their lipids with decreasing temperature over their whole growth temperature range. The other mesophiles (Enterobacter aerogenes and Lactobacillus casei) increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids with decreasing temperature only over the lower half of their growth temperature ranges. The psychrotrophs Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter sp. had a constant proportion of unsaturated acids over the lower half of their growth temperature range, while the psychotrophic Lactobacillus sp. showed no consistent change in its unsaturated fatty acid composition with temperature. All species showed some variation of unsaturated fatty acid composition with growth rate at the highest and lowest growth temperatures, although such variations were small in some species (Ent. aerogenes and Lactobacillus sp.).
TI  - Microbial conversion of DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid to L-cysteine and L-cystine: screening of microorganisms and identification of products.
AB  - Microorganisms able to form L-cysteine from DL-2-amino-delta2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (DL-ATC), a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of DL-cysteine, were isolated from soil samples and classified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas cohaerens, P. desmolytica, and P. ovalis. Thirteen L-cysteine-producing bacteria were also found in among 463 stock cultures representing 37 genera. These were Achromobacter delmarvae. Alcaligenes denitrificans, Bacillus brevis, Brevibacterium flavum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia carotovora, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus sodonensis, Myocoplana dimorpha, Sarcina lutea, Serratia marcescens, Flavobacterium acidoficum, and Pseudomonas ovalis. In the presence of intact cells of Pseudomonas sp. AJ 3854, 6.1 mg of L-cysteine and/or L-cystine per ml was produced from 10 mg of DL-ATC-3H2O per ml in a molar yield of 100%. This finding suggests that racemization and asymmetric hydrolysis occurred simultaneously in this incubation mixture. After the complete oxidation of cysteine to cystine by aeration in the presence of ferrous ion, crystalline cystine was isolated; its configuration was the L isomer based on data from X-ray diffraction, microbioassay, and optical rotation studies.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to Gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia also had a urinary tract infection. Two patients had a respiratory tract infection, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient, and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 hr after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - [Behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  - The bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of Maize starch on Escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. This toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter sp. Moreover, for the eucaryote cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. The results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.
TI  - Studies on 4 C stored frozen-reconstituted red blood cells. I. Bacterial growth.
AB  - A knowledge of the growth rates of various organisms at the storage temperature of 4 C in the different suspending media used for red blood cells would aid the extension of the thawed storage time of frozen-reconstituted blood beyond the 24 hours allowed by the Food and Drug Administration. Knowing these rates, a prediction could be made that the growth rate would be sufficiently slow and the unit (sterile or minimally contaminated) could be given safely after a longer storage period. The studies reported show that the pathogenic organisms S. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. grow at such a slow rate at 4 C that they do not represent any great hazard to the recipient unless introduced in great numbers. The studies further show that in the process of washing frozen blood the number of organisms is reduced by between one and two orders of magnitude (base 10). Therefore, extension of frozen red blood cell storage life to at least 72 hours should be considered.
TI  - Electrical impedance measurements in the reading and monitoring of broth dilution susceptibility tests.
AB  - Electrical impedance changes in the medium were studied during traditional broth  dilution tests. Tests involved clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella, and enterococcus and ten antibiotics. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values from overnight visual readings were compared with MIC values determined from electrical impedance end points, using inocula of 10(6) organisms per ml. Ninety-three percent of the results were within one twofold dilution of each other. When the impedance end point was determined at 6 h, this correlation was lowered to 34%. By increasing the initial electrical impedance inoculum 10-fold, the correlation between the 6-h impedance MIC and the overnight visual MIC was improved to 74%. Ampicillin, tetracycline, and polymyxin E results accounted for most discrepancies. Continuous monitoring of impedance changes suggested that better correspondence could be obtained by adjusting the end point criteria for the 6-h impedance MIC with different antibiotics. Electrical impedance methods for reading bacterial end points in automated clinical laboratory instruments appear promising.
TI  - Simplified scheme for identification of prompt lactose-fermenting members of the  Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A brief, simplified scheme involving the spot indole test and colonial morphology was evaluated for genus level identification of prompt lactose-fermenting (PLF) members of the Enterobacteriaceae. One hundred and ninety-four consecutive, clinically important PLF gram-negative rods isolated in a clinical microbiology laboratory were identified by this simplified scheme, as well as by standard biochemical tests, and the API 20E (Analytab Products, Inc., Plainview, N.Y.) system. In the simplified scheme a flat, spot indole-positive colony was identified as Escherichia coli. Spot indole-negative organisms forming nucoid colonies were identified as Klebsiella sp. or Enterobacter sp. on the basis of semisolid motility and ornithine decarboxylase tests. Approximately 94% of the study isolates followed reactions typical for E. coli, Klebsiella sp., and Enterobacter sp. as defined by this simplified scheme. When compared with the standard and Analytab Products Inc. identifications, the overall accuracy was 97.4%. The accuracy of identification of E. coli, Klebsiella sp., and Enterobacter sp. was 98.1%, 95.6%, and 87.5%, respectively. This simplified scheme is recommended for identification of selected PLF isolates in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol. The mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative activity in vitro of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin.
AB  - The activity of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin was compared in vitro using a microtiter tube dilution test in Mueller-Hinton broth against 50 recent clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal end points were determined using a modified Steers replicator. Ticarcillin was generally two to four times more active against all organisms tested except S. epidermidis against which BL-P1654 was most active. Median minimum inhibitory concentrations in micrograms per milliliter were for S. aureus: ticarcillin (6.2), carbenicillin (12.5), BL-P1654 (25); for S. epidermidis: BL-P1654 (1.6), ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (3.2); for E. coli: ticarcillin (3.2), BL-P1654 (6.2), carbenicillin (6.2); for Klebsiella sp.: >100 for all three drugs; for Enterobacter sp.: ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (6.2), BL-P1654 (12.5); for Proteus sp.: ticarcillin (1.6), carbenicillin (1.6), BL-P1654 (3.2); for P. aeruginosa: ticarcillin (31), BL-P1654 (62), carbenicillin (125). Bactericidal end points were dependent on both the drug and the species but were in general no more than twofold more than the minimum inhibitory concentration with the exception of BL-P1654 against P. aeruginosa. BL-P1654 was bactericidal for only 60% of the strains tested at a concentration of 500 mug/ml.
TI  - Susceptibility of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus (Herellea vaginicola) to minocycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of minocycline against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus (Herellea vaginicola) was examined. All strains of A. anitratus were inhibited by minocycline at concentrations of 0.4 mug/ml or less. The strains studied were considerably more susceptible to minocycline than tetracycline. No difference between the susceptibility to minocycline and tetracycline was seen with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter and Proteus sp. A regression line of the log minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and the diameter of the zone of inhibition, determined by the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed good linear correlation for minocycline. Comparison of the disk diffusion results and MICs indicated that an inhibitory zone size of 19 mm produced by a 30-mug minocycline disk was equivalent to a MIC of 3.1 mug/ml, a serum concentration achieved by oral administration of the drug. When the zone of inhibition was greater than 19 mm, however, there was poor correlation with the MIC for Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Epidemiologic aspects of nosocomial infections.
AB  - In a currently ongoing surveillance of hospital-associated infections in two metropolitan hospitals in Oklahoma, the results over a four-month period suggest at least tentative principles of host-agent relationships in hospital-associated infections. Within the urinary tract, the site with the highest number of total isolations, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. By age, the under 5 and over 60 year age groups had the highest number of isolations. Staphylococcus aureus and E coli were isolated more frequently in the younger group, while K pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis occurred more frequently in infections among the older group. A higher frequency of Enterobacter sp and S aureus were isolated among male patients, while Candida albicans and E coli apparently had a greater affinity for females; however, none of these differences by sex were statistically significant. Over 50% of the infections were manifest within the first ten days of hospitalization.
TI  - Infection and mortality in captive wild-trapped canvasback ducks.
AB  - Fungal, bacterial and malarial infections, as well as malnutrition caused heavy mortality in a group of wild-trapped canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) held in 10 X 3 X 2 m open-water pens. Deaths occurred between 21 and 158 days after confinement and were associated with infections of Aspergillus fumigatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Plasmodium sp. Infection and mortality was believed to result from reduced resistance associated with confinement. Fourteen canvasbacks released onto large ponds survived throughout the period during which the penned birds died.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activities of sisomicin and gentamicin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Sisomicin was found to be more active on a weight basis than gentamicin against Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and indole-positive Proteus. Gentamicin was more active than sisomicin against Escherichia coli, Serratia sp., Enterobacter sp., and Proteus mirabilis. Both antibiotics were very active against methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. Cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against Proteus mirabilis. Both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against S. aureus, were slightly more active against K. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against E. coli. All strains of indole-positive Proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. Eighty-eight percent of Enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin and cephalothin, respectively. Peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110 mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg) in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. These levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. There was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. The percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. The half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.
TI  - [In vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  - In vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (AB-PC), carbenicillin (CB-PC), sulbenicillin (SB-PC) cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ) and gentamicin (GM). Fifty three % of Escherichia coli strains 53.3% of Citrobacter sp., 80% of Proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of Morganella and 80% of Bacteroides sp. were susceptible (MIC being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to AB-PC. The eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. CB-PC and SB-PC were almost as effective as AB-PC against Escherichia coli and Citrobacter sp. They were less active against Klebsiella sp., but more active against Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus group and Pseudomonas sp. than AB-PC, SB-PC was more effective than CB-PC against Pseudomonas sp. The strains of Pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of CB-PC and SB-PC were pyocyanine-negative strains. All strains (100%) of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. were susceptible to CET and CEZ, while none of Enterobacter sp. , Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris. Morganella, Rettgerella, Providencia and Pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. The MICs of CET and CEZ against Bacteroides sp. were moderately low. Some strains of Providencia and Alkaligenes sp. were resistant of GM but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high MICs against Bacteroides sp. When seen from the MIC distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).
TI  - Susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  - Combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. Synergistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were noted against most strains of E. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. Of 16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of E. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin G with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. The marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - No one can doubt the increased incidence of gram-negative bacillary infections and the importance of an awareness of this increase. Today's hospital, where one finds aggressive surgery, patients with multiple indwelling polyethylene lines and Foley catheters, and widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics, serves as a haven for resistant gram-negative bacilli. Twenty-five strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Pseudomonas sp, indole-negative Proteus sp, indole-positive Proteus sp, and Serratia sp from hospitalized patients were tested for susceptibility to eight commonly used antibiotics using an inocula replicating method. Gentamicin proved to be the most effective antibiotic against the majority; most strains were inhibited by 3.12mug/ml or less. Other antibiotics, although not so active against all species, were effective against selected species.
TI  - Cinoxacin: in vitro antibacterial studies of a new synthetic organic acid.
AB  - Cinoxacin (compound 64716) is a synthetic organic acid with antibacterial activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of cinoxacin (agar-dilution method) were determined for 419 strains. Escherichia coli was the most susceptible group of organisms. The majority of Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., and Serratia marcescens were inhibited by 8 mug of cinoxacin per ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all gram-positive isolates tested were resistant to 64 mug or less of cinoxacin per ml. Zones of inhibition using a 30-mug disk correlated well with agar-dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (r = -0.9). Cinoxacin was bactericidal when tested with inocula of 5 x 10(6) organisms per ml. Resistance to cinoxacin was readily developed in all three strains tested by serial passage on drug-containing agar. The in vitro properties of this agent were similar to those of nalidixic acid.
TI  - [A bacteriological study of otitis in dogs (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; Escherichia coli from 10; Proteus mirabilis from 20; Enterobacter sp. from 18 and Klepsiella sp. from 7. Mixed cultures of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter sp. in 5; Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis in 4. Enterobacter sp. and Klepsiella sp. in 2 and Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in 6. Theses results indicated that Staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (23%) and Klepsiella sp. (16%). Drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with gram-negative bacteremias also had urinary tract infections. Two patients had respiratory tract infections, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 h after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 mug/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - Microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, BL-S 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
AB  - BL-S 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.
TI  - In vitro studies of semisynthetic alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins.
AB  - The activity of three alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins was evaluated in vitro against 599 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli, by use of the broth-dilution technique. At a concentration of 12.5 mug or less/ml, BL-P1597 inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas sp., 56% of Enterobacter sp., 67% of indole-positive Proteus spp., 72% of Escherichia coli, and 85% of Proteus mirabilis. BL-P1654 had similar activity, whereas BL-P1532 was much less active. At a concentration of 25 mug or less/ml, BL-P1597 also inhibited nearly 60% of isolates of Klebsiella sp. and nearly 40% of Serratia sp. BL-P1597 and BL-P1654 were as active as ampicillin and carbenicillin against E. coli and P. mirabilis. They were less active than carbenicillin against indole-positive Proteus spp. Both drugs were substantially more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas sp. A strain of Pseudomonas sp. which developed resistance to carbenicillin also developed resistance to the alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins simultaneously.
TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  - In vitro activity of carbenicillin against gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of a new semisynthetic penicillin, carbenicillin, was determined against 241 strains of gram-negative bacilli with the tube-dilution technique. Of 143 strains of Pseudomonas sp., 99 had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 200 to 300 mug/ml. The majority of strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. were sensitive to this antibiotic, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 25 mug/ml or less. Strains of Klebsiella sp. were quite resistant to carbenicillin. The size of inoculum had no significant effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration for Pseudomonas sp.
TI  - Effect of coliform and Proteus bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of coliform and Proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth. Inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 C). Time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. When the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 C (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of Proteus. When the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 C, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 C, and only Escherichia coli delayed the coccus at 30 C. All effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 C when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. Greatest overall inhibition was by E. coli, E. freundii, and Proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 C. Aerobacter cloacae and Paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 C. In general, results were similar with different strains of a species. Except for Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and P. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. II. Causes of inhibition.
AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
