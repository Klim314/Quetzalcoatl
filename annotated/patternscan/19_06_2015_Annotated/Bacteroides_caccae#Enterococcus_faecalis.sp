TI  == isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria from japanese tree frog (hlya japonica) with the special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the bacteria in the large intestines of eight japanese tree frogs (hlya japonica) were enumerated by using an anaerobic culture system. the microorganisms at approximately 3.1 x 10(9) bacteria per g (wet weight) of intestinal contents were present in the intestine of all the frogs tested. no difference of the total bacteria in the frog intestine was observed between two different incubation-temperatures (room temperature and 37 degrees c). eleven genera and 16 species were isolated from the frog intestine. in most frogs, bacteroides (b.) caccae and b. vulgatus were detected as the predominant organisms. escherichia coli was also present in greater numbers in the intestine. other bacteria isolated at high dilutions were strict anaerobes, including fusobacterium and clostridium. enterococcus faecalis was frequently isolated from the frog intestine. however, four genera of bifidobacterium, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, and lactobacillus were not isolated from the frog intestine.
