TI  - Effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  - Duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183(F) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82(R) and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194(R) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194(R) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.
TI  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa from bison, cattle-bison hybrids, and  cattle fed three alfalfa-corn diets.
AB  - Ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa and in vitro digestibility of alfalfa  fiber fractions were compared among bison, bison hybrids, and crossbed cattle (five each) when they were fed alfalfa and corn in a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, and 50:50, respectively. The total number of viable bacteria (2.16 x 10(9) to 5.44 x 10(9)/ml of ruminal fluid) and the number of cellulolytic bacteria (3.74 x 10(7) to 10.9 x 10(7)/ml) were not different among groups of animals fed each diet. The genera of protozoa in all of the animal groups were similar; however, when either the 100:0 or 50:50 diet was used the percentage of Entodinium sp. was lower and the percentage of Diplodiniinae was higher (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids or cattle. Bacteroides succinogenes made up the largest number of cellulolytic isolates from bison (58 and 36%, respectively, on the 100:0 and 75:25 diets), which were more numerous (P less than 0.05) than those from bison hybrids (36 and 12%) and cattle (33 and 18%). This was offset by a lower number of cellulolytic Butyrivibrio isolates. The numbers of Ruminococcus albus and R. flavefaciens isolates, in general, were similar among the bovid species, although R. flavefaciens generally made up less than 10% of the cellulolytic isolates. In vitro digestibility coefficients were greater (P less than 0.05) for the bison when the 75:25 diet was used and similar for the other two diets. The concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids was larger (P less than 0.05) in bison than in bison hybrids and cattle when the 50:50 diet was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation and presumptive identification of adherent epithelial bacteria ("epimural" bacteria) from the ovine rumen wall.
AB  - One hundred sixty-one strains of adherent bacteria were isolated under anaerobic  conditions from four sites on the rumen epithelial surface of sheep fed hay or a hay-grain ration. Before isolation of bacteria, rumen tissue was washed six times in an anaerobic dilution solution, and viable bacteria suspended in the washings were counted. Calculation indicated that unattached bacteria would have been removed from the tissue by this procedure, but a slow and progressive release of attached bacteria also occurred. Nevertheless, a wide range of characteristic morphological types remained associated with the epithelium as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Most of these types were represented among the isolates. Characterization and presumptive identification of the isolates showed that 95.0% belonged to previously described genera of functionally significant rumen bacteria, including Butyrivibrio sp. (31.1%), Bacteroides sp. (22.4%), Selenomonas ruminantium (9.9%), Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens (8.7%), Streptococcus bovis (8.1%), Propionibacterium sp. (4.3%), Treponema sp. (3.1%), and Eubacterium sp., Lachnospira multiparus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.5% each). Eight isolates (5.0%) were not identified. L. multiparus was recovered only from hay-fed animals; all other genera were obtained from animals fed either ration. All S. bovis strains and two strains each of Bacteroides sp. and Butyrivibrio sp. were aerotolerant; all other strains were strictly anaerobic. Bacteria representing the gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic flora associated with rumen wall tissue (R. J. Wallace, K.-J. Cheng, D. Dinsdale, and E. R. Orskov, Nature (London) 279:424-426, 1979) were therefore not recovered by the techniques used; instead a different fraction of the adherent population was isolated. The term "epimural" is proposed to describe the flora associated with the rumen epithelium.
TI  - Fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  - Studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H10b and D16f, Bacteroides ruminicola 23 and D31d, Lachnospira multiparus D15d, Peptostreptococcus sp. D43e, B. succinogenes A3c, Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b, and R. albus 7). Only three strains, 23, D16f, and D31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except A3c and H10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. Nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. Pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. For bromegrass I, all strains tested (B34b, 23, D16f, D31d, D15d, and D43e) degraded a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of B34b, utilized most of what was degraded. Similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass II, except for the two strains of B. ruminicola, 23 and D31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. All strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and D31d. Synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, B34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, D31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. Similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains B34b and D16f; however, no increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.
