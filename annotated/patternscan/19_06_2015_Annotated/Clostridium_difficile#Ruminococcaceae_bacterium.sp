TI  == metabolomics analysis identifies intestinal microbiota-derived biomarkers of colonization resistance in clindamycin-treated mice.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota protect the host against enteric pathogens  through a defense mechanism termed colonization resistance. antibiotics excreted  into the intestinal tract may disrupt colonization resistance and alter normal metabolic functions of the microbiota. we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that alterations in levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal specimens could provide useful biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment. methods: to assess in vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with oral vancomycin-resistant enterococcus or clostridium difficile spores at varying time points after treatment with the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin. for concurrent groups of antibiotic-treated mice, stool samples were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in the microbiota and using non-targeted metabolic profiling. to assess whether the findings were applicable to another antibiotic class that suppresses intestinal anaerobes, similar experiments were conducted with piperacillin/tazobactam. results: colonization resistance began to recover within 5 days and was intact by 12 days after clindamycin treatment, coinciding with the recovery bacteria from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, both part of the phylum firmicutes. clindamycin treatment caused marked changes in metabolites present in fecal specimens. of 484 compounds analyzed, 146 (30%) exhibited a significant increase or decrease in concentration during clindamycin  treatment followed by recovery to baseline that coincided with restoration of in  vivo colonization resistance. identified as potential biomarkers of colonization  resistance, these compounds included intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that increased (pentitols, gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites) or decreased (pentoses, dipeptides) with clindamycin treatment. piperacillin/tazobactam treatment caused similar alterations in the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolites. conclusions: recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. these metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.

TI  == microbiome data distinguish patients with clostridium difficile infection and non-c. difficile-associated diarrhea from healthy controls.
AB  == antibiotic usage is the most commonly cited risk factor for hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infections (cdi). the increased risk is due to disruption of the indigenous microbiome and a subsequent decrease in colonization resistance by the perturbed bacterial community; however, the specific changes in the microbiome that lead to increased risk are poorly understood. we developed statistical models that incorporated microbiome data with clinical and demographic data to better understand why individuals develop cdi. the 16s rrna genes were sequenced from the feces of 338 individuals, including cases, diarrheal controls, and nondiarrheal controls. we modeled cdi and diarrheal status using multiple clinical variables, including age, antibiotic use, antacid  use, and other known risk factors using logit regression. this base model was compared to models that incorporated microbiome data, using diversity metrics, community types, or specific bacterial populations, to identify characteristics of the microbiome associated with cdi susceptibility or resistance. the addition  of microbiome data significantly improved our ability to distinguish cdi status when comparing cases or diarrheal controls to nondiarrheal controls. however, only when we assigned samples to community types was it possible to differentiate cases from diarrheal controls. several bacterial species within the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, bacteroides, and porphyromonadaceae were largely absent in cases and highly associated with nondiarrheal controls. the improved discriminatory ability of our microbiome-based models confirms the theory that factors affecting the microbiome influence cdi. importance the gut microbiome, composed of the trillions of bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, is responsible for a number of critical functions within  the host. these include digestion, immune system stimulation, and colonization resistance. the microbiome's role in colonization resistance, which is the ability to prevent and limit pathogen colonization and growth, is key for protection against clostridium difficile infections. however, the bacteria that are important for colonization resistance have not yet been elucidated. using statistical modeling techniques and different representations of the microbiome,  we demonstrated that several community types and the loss of several bacterial populations, including bacteroides, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae, are associated with cdi. our results emphasize the importance of considering the microbiome in mediating colonization resistance and may also direct the design of future multispecies probiotic therapies.

TI  == microbiota dynamics in patients treated with fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembraneous colitis and is responsible for a large and increasing fraction of hospital-acquired infections. fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is an alternate treatment option for recurrent c. difficile infection (rcdi) refractory to antibiotic therapy. it has recently been discussed favorably in the clinical and scientific communities and is receiving increasing public attention. however, short- and long-term health consequences of fmt remain a concern, as the effects  of the transplanted microbiota on the patient remain unknown. to shed light on microbial events associated with rcdi and treatment by fmt, we performed fecal microbiota analysis by 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing of 14 pairs of healthy donors and rcdi patients treated successfully by fmt. post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples collected up to one year after fmt were studied longitudinally, including one post-fmt patient with antibiotic-associated relapse three months after fmt. this analysis allowed us not only to confirm prior reports that rcdi is associated with reduced diversity and compositional changes  in the fecal microbiota, but also to characterize previously undocumented post-fmt microbiota dynamics. members of the streptococcaceae, enterococcaceae, or enterobacteriaceae were significantly increased and putative butyrate producers, such as lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae were significantly reduced in samples from rcdi patients before fmt as compared to post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples. rcdi patient samples showed more case-specific variations  than post-fmt patient and healthy donor samples. however, none of the bacterial groups were invariably associated with rcdi or successful treatment by fmt. overall microbiota compositions in post-fmt patients, specifically abundances of  the above-mentioned firmicutes, continued to change for at least 16 weeks after fmt, suggesting that full microbiota recovery from rcdi may take much longer than expected based on the disappearance of diarrheal symptoms immediately after fmt.

TI  == a genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: gram-negative spore formers and other  misplaced clostridia.
AB  == the class clostridia in the phylum firmicutes (formerly low-g+c gram-positive bacteria) includes diverse bacteria of medical, environmental and biotechnological importance. the selenomonas-megasphaera-sporomusa branch, which  unifies members of the firmicutes with gram-negative-type cell envelopes, was recently moved from clostridia to a separate class negativicutes. however, draft  genome sequences of the spore-forming members of the negativicutes revealed typically clostridial sets of sporulation genes. to address this and other questions in clostridial phylogeny, we have compared a phylogenetic tree for a concatenated set of 50 widespread ribosomal proteins with the trees for beta subunits of the rna polymerase (rpob) and dna gyrase (gyrb) and with the 16s rrna-based phylogeny. the results obtained by these methods showed remarkable consistency, suggesting that they reflect the true evolutionary history of these  bacteria. these data put the selenomonas-megasphaera-sporomusa group back within  the clostridia. they also support placement of clostridium difficile and its close relatives within the family peptostreptococcaceae; we suggest resolving the long-standing naming conundrum by renaming it peptoclostridium difficile. these data also indicate the existence of a group of cellulolytic clostridia that belong to the family ruminococcaceae. as a tentative solution to resolve the current taxonomical problems, we propose assigning 78 validly described clostridium species that clearly fall outside the family clostridiaceae to six new genera: peptoclostridium, lachnoclostridium, ruminiclostridium, erysipelatoclostridium, gottschalkia and tyzzerella. this work reaffirms that 16s rrna and ribosomal protein sequences are better indicators of evolutionary proximity than phenotypic traits, even such key ones as the structure of the cell envelope and gram-staining pattern.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis and depletion of butyrogenic bacteria in clostridium difficile infection and nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection (cdi) causes nearly half a million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the united states each year. although the importance of the gut microbiota in c. difficile pathogenesis is well recognized, components of the human gut flora critical for colonization resistance are not known. culture-independent high-density roche 454 pyrosequencing was used to survey the  distal gut microbiota for 39 individuals with cdi, 36 subjects with c. difficile-negative nosocomial diarrhea (cdn), and 40 healthy control subjects. a  total of 526,071 partial 16s rrna sequence reads of the v1 to v3 regions were aligned with 16s databases, identifying 3,531 bacterial phylotypes from 115 fecal samples. genomic analysis revealed significant alterations of organism lineages in both the cdi and cdn groups, which were accompanied by marked decreases in microbial diversity and species richness driven primarily by a paucity of phylotypes within the firmicutes phylum. normally abundant gut commensal organisms, including the ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae families and butyrate-producing c2 to c4 anaerobic fermenters, were significantly depleted in  the cdi and cdn groups. these data demonstrate associations between the depletion of ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, and butyrogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota and nosocomial diarrhea, including c. difficile infection. mechanistic studies focusing on the functional roles of these organisms in diarrheal diseases and resistance against c. difficile colonization are warranted.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.
AB  == fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is becoming a more widely used technology  for treatment of recurrent clostridum difficile infection (cdi). while previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for fmt, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat cdi. here we report that high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following fmt using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. post fmt samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. proteobacteria and actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to fmt. post fmt samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of  members of the families bacteroidaceae, rikenellaceae and porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of bacteroides, alistipes and parabacteroides genera. members of the phylum firmicutes were represented by ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified clostridiales and members of the firmicutes. one patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal proteobacteria, primarily enterobacteriaceae. our results demonstrate that frozen fecal microbiota from a healthy donor can be used to effectively treat recurrent cdi resulting in restoration of the structure of gut microbiota and clearing of clostridum difficile.
