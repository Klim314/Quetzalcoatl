TI  - Bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov., Bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. and Bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov., isolated from chicken caecum.
AB  - Eight bacterial strains isolated from the caecum of chicken, BL2(T), BL66, EG3, EG6, M27, BL78(T), C35(T) and C43, were characterized by determining their phenotypic characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the genus Bacteroides. One group of five strains (BL2(T), BL66, EG3, EG6 and M27) was related most closely to Bacteroides coprocola JCM 12979(T), with approximately 93 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, and to Bacteroides plebeius JCM 12973(T), with about 92 % similarity, and shared >or=99.6 % similarity with each other. Strain BL78(T) exhibited 90.5 % similarity to B. plebeius JCM 12973(T) and 89.8 % similarity to B. coprocola JCM 12979(T) and differed from the above group of five strains at >or=10 % sequence divergence. Strains C35(T) and C43 were related most closely to Bacteroides eggerthii JCM 12986(T), with 95.1 % sequence similarity, to Bacteroides stercoris JCM 9496(T), with 94.6 % similarity, and to Bacteroides uniformis JCM 5828(T), with 94.4 % similarity, and shared 100 % similarity with each other. From results of phenotypic examination, cellular fatty acid composition analysis, menaquinone composition analysis and DNA G+C contents, the group of five strains as well as strain BL78(T) were shown to differ from the type strains of B. coprocola and B. plebeius. Strain BL78(T) differed from the others based on its menaquinone composition, which included MK-11 and MK-12. Strains C35(T) and C43 could also be differentiated from the type strains of B. eggerthii, B. stercoris and B. uniformis. The group of five strains, strain BL78(T), B. coprocola JCM 12979(T) and B. plebeius JCM 12973(T) showed low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness (<35 %) with each other. High levels of DNA-DNA relatedness were obtained within the group of five strains (>75 %). Strains C35(T) and C43 exhibited a high level of DNA-DNA relatedness (>88 %) with each other, but low levels with B. eggerthii JCM 12986(T) (<40 %), B. stercoris JCM 9496(T) (<37 %) and B. uniformis JCM 5828(T) (<16 %). On the basis of these data, three novel Bacteroides species are proposed: Bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov. (type strain BL2(T)=JCM 13652(T)=DSM 18169(T)), Bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. (type strain BL78(T)=JCM 13657(T)=DSM 18170(T)) and Bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain C35(T)=JCM 13658(T)=DSM 18171(T)).
TI  - Purification and characterization of acharan sulfate lyases, two novel heparinases, from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15.
AB  - Two novel acharan sulfate lyases (ASL1 and ASL2: no EC number) have been purified from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15 which was isolated from human intestinal bacteria with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degrading enzymes. These enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of QAE-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, carboxymethyl-Sephadex C-50, hydroxyapatite and HiTrap SP Sephadex C-25 column chromatography with the final specific activity of 50.5 and 76.7 micromol.min-1.mg-1, respectively. Both acharan sulfate lyases are single subunits of 83 kDa by SDS/PAGE and gel filtration. ASL1 showed optimal activity at pH 7.2 and 45 degrees C. ASL1 activity was inhibited by Cu2+, Ni2+ and Co2+, but ASL2 activity was inhibited by Cu2+, Ni2+and Pb2. Both enzymes were slightly inhibited by some agents that modify histidine and cysteine residues, but activated by reducing agents such as DL-dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol. Both purified bacteroidal acharan sulfate lyases acted to the greatest extent on acharan sulfate, and to a lesser extents on heparan sulfate and heparin. They did not act on de-O-sulfated acharan sulfate. These findings suggest that the biochemical properties of these purified acharan sulfate lyases are different from those of the previously purified heparin lyases, but these enzymes belong to heparinase II.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel heparinase from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15.
AB  - A novel type of heparinase (heparin lyase, no EC number) has been purified from Bacteroides stercoris HJ-15, isolated from human intestine, which produces three kinds of heparinases. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of QAE-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, CM-Sephadex C-50, hydroxyapatite, and HiTrap SP chromatographies with a final specific activity of 19.5 mmol/min/mg. It showed optimal activity at pH 7.2 and 45 degrees C and the presence of 300 mM KCl greatly enhanced its activity. The purified enzyme activity was inhibited by Cu(2+), Pb(2+), and some agents that modify histidine and cysteine residues, and activated by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol. This purified Bacteroides heparinase is an eliminase that shows its greatest activity on bovine intestinal heparan sulfate, and to a lesser extent on porcine intestinal heparan sulfate and heparin. This enzyme does not act on acharan sulfate but de-O-sulfated acharan sulfate and N-sulfoacharan sulfate were found to be poor substrates. The substrate specificity of this enzyme is similar to that of Flavobacterial heparinase II. However, an internal amino acid sequence of the purified Bacteroides heparinase shows significant (73%) homology to Flavobacterial heparinase III and only 43% homology to Flavobacterial heparinase II. These findings suggest that the Bacteroidal heparinase is a novel enzyme degrading GAGs.
TI  - Characterization of a Bacteroides species from human intestine that degrades glycosaminoglycans.
AB  - Polysaccharide lyases that can degrade glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were identified  in an anaerobic strain living in the human intestine. The strain was isolated from the stool of a healthy male and identified as Bacteroides sp. strain HJ-15. A detailed taxonomical study indicated the species is a strain of Bacteroides stercoris. The isolate was cultured and the polysaccharide lyase activity was partially purified. This enzyme preparation could act on GAGs containing either glucosamine or galactosamine suggesting the presence of both heparinases and chondroitinases. Various GAGs were incubated with the partially purified enzyme and the products formed were analyzed by strong anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These studies demonstrated the presence of at least two types of polysaccharide lyases: heparin lyase and chondroitin sulfate lyase. The eliminative mechanism of these lyase enzymes was confirmed through the isolation of unsaturated disaccharide products. The heparin lyase acted on both heparin and acharan sulfate, a GAG recently isolated from Achatina fulica. The Bacteroides chondroitin lyase, acted on chondroitin sulfates A, B (dermatan sulfate), and C, resembling chondroitin lyase ABC. The presence of a GAG-degrading organism in human intestine may pose problems for the effective oral administration of GAG drugs.
