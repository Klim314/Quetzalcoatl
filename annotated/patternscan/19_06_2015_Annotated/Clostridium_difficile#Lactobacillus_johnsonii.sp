TI  == a highly acid-resistant novel strain of lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 has antibacterial activity, including that against helicobacter pylori, and inhibits  gastrin-mediated acid production in mice.
AB  == a novel strain of lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 was isolated from the gastric  juice of a healthy japanese male volunteer, and characterized for its effectiveness in the stomach environment. lactobacillus johnsonii no. 1088 was found to have the strongest acid resistance among several lactobacilli examined (>10% of cells survived at ph 1.0 after 2 h), and such a high acid resistance property was a specific characteristic of this strain of l. johnsonii. when cultured with various virulent bacteria, l. johnsonii no. 1088 inhibited the growth of helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli o-157, salmonella typhimurium, and clostridium difficile, in which case its effectiveness was more potent than that of a type strain of l. johnsonii, jcm2012. in addition to its effect in vitro, l. johnsonii no. 1088 inhibited the growth of h. pylori in human intestinal microbiota-associated mice in both its live and lyophilized forms. moreover, l. johnsonii no. 1088 suppressed gastric acid secretion in mice via decreasing the number of gastrin-positive cells in the stomach. these results taken together suggest that l. johnsonii no. 1088 is a unique lactobacillus having properties beneficial for supporting h. pylori eradication by triple therapy including the use of a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) and also for prophylaxis of gastroesophageal reflux disease possibly caused after h. pylori eradication as a side effect of ppi.
