TI  - Microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  - High-pressure processing (300 MPa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. Pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. Microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. High-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. Microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. Pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count. Molecular characterization studies revealed that Enterobacter amnigenus and Enterobacter sp. in control and Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus gallinarum and Acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.
