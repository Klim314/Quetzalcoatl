TI  == effect of applying bacterial inoculants containing different types of bacteria to corn silage on the performance of dairy cattle.
AB  == this study examined the effect of applying different bacterial inoculants to corn silage at the time of ensiling on the performance of lactating dairy cows. corn plants were harvested at 35% dry matter (dm), chopped, and ensiled in 2.4-m-wide  bags after application of (1) no inoculant (con); (2) biotal plus ii (b2) containing pediococcus pentosaceus and propionibacteria freudenreichii; (3) buchneri 40788 (buc) containing lactobacillus buchneri; or (4) buchneri 500 (b500) containing pediococcus pentosaceus and l. buchneri. all inoculants were supplied by lallemand animal nutrition (milwaukee, wi). each of the 4 silages was included in separate total mixed rations consisting of 44% corn silage, 50% concentrate, and 6% alfalfa hay (dm basis). fifty-two lactating holstein cows were stratified according to milk production and parity and randomly assigned at  22 d in milk to the 4 dietary treatments. cows were fed for ad libitum consumption and milked twice daily for 49 d. dietary treatment did not affect intakes (kg/d) of dm (20.0), crude protein (cp; 3.7), neutral detergent fiber (ndf; 5.7), or acid detergent fiber (adf; 3.6), or digestibility (%) of dm (73.9) or cp (72.4). however, ndf digestibility was lower in cows fed b2 compared with those fed other diets (45.3 vs. 53.0%). consequently, cows fed b2 had lower digestible ndf intake (kg/d) than those fed other diets (2.5 vs. 3.0 kg/d). dietary treatment did not affect milk yield (32.3 kg/d), efficiency of milk production (1.61), concentrations of milk fat (3.18%) and protein (2.79%), or yields of milk fat (1.03 kg/d) and protein (1.26 kg/d). inoculant application to  corn silage did not affect milk yield or feed intake of cows.

TI  == effect of applying inoculants with heterolactic or homolactic and heterolactic bacteria on the fermentation and quality of corn silage.
AB  == this study examined the effect of applying different bacterial inoculants on the  fermentation and quality of corn silage. corn plants were harvested at 35% dm, chopped, and ensiled in 20-l mini silos after application of (1) deionized water  (con) or inoculants containing (2) 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of pediococcus pentosaceus 12455 and propionibacteria freudenreichii (b2); (3) 4 x 10(5) cfu/g of lactobacillus buchneri 40788 (buc); or (4) 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of pediococcus pentosaceus 12455 and 4 x 10(5) cfu/g of l. buchneri 40788 (b500). four replicates of each treatment were weighed into polyethylene bags within 20-l mini silos. silos were stored for 575 d at ambient temperature (25 degrees c) in a covered barn. after silos were opened, aerobic stability, chemical composition, and yeast and mold counts were determined. the dna in treated and untreated silages was extracted using lysozyme/sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis and phenol/chloroform and used as a template for a conventional pcr with primers designed on the 16s rrna gene to detect the presence of l. buchneri in all silage samples. acetic acid concentration was greater in b2 silages versus others (6.46  vs. 4.23% dm). silages treated with buc and b500 had lower ph and propionic acid  concentration and greater lactic acid concentration than others. the b500 silage  had the greatest lactic:acetic acid ratio (1.54 vs. 0.41), and only treatment with buc reduced dm losses (5.0 vs. 14.3%). yeast and mold counts were less than  the threshold (10(5)) typically associated with silage spoilage and did not differ among treatments. consequently, all silages were very stable (>250 h). aerobic stability was not improved by any inoculant but was lower in b500 silages versus others (276 vs. 386 h). the conventional pcr confirmed the presence of similar populations of l. buchneri in all silages. this may have contributed to the prolonged aerobic stability of all silages.

TI  == control of escherichia coli o157:h7 in corn silage with or without various inoculants: efficacy and mode of action.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 commercial bacterial inoculants at controlling escherichia coli o157:h7 in corn silages during ensiling and feedout phases of silage production. a second objective was to determine whether the inoculants exhibited and transferred antibacterial activity against e. coli o157:h7 to the silages. chopped corn forage was ensiled after treatment with the following: distilled water (control); 5 x 10(5) cfu/g of e. coli o157:h7 (ec); ec and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of pediococcus pentosaceus and propionibacterium freudenreichii (ec+bii); ec and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of lactobacillus buchneri (ec+lb); and ec and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of l. buchneri and p.  pentosaceus (ec+b500). each treatment was ensiled in triplicate in mini silos for 3, 7, 31, and 82 d and analyzed for ph and e. coli o157:h7 counts. samples from d 82 were also analyzed for volatile fatty acids, lactate, and aerobic stability. antibacterial activity of inoculants and silages was determined by the kirby-bauer disc diffusion test. the ph of silages from all treatments decreased  below 4 within 3 d of ensiling and remained low until d 82. therefore, e. coli o157:h7 was not detected in silages after any of the ensiling durations. applying inoculants containing l. buchneri resulted in less lactate, more acetate, and greater aerobic stability compared with the control. applying ec+bii containing p. freudenreichii did not increase propionate or aerobic stability. subsamples of d 82 silages were reinoculated with 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of e. coli o157:h7 either immediately after silo opening on d 82 or after 144h of aerobic exposure (d 88),  and e. coli were enumerated 24h later. all silages reinoculated with the pathogen on d 82 had similar, low ph values (<4) and no e. coli were detected 24h later. control, ec, and ec+bii silages reinoculated with the pathogen after 144h of aerobic exposure had relatively greater ph values (4.71, 5.67, and 6.03, respectively) and e. coli counts (2.87, 6.73, and 6.87 log cfu/g, respectively) 24h later, whereas those treated with l. buchneri had low ph values (<4) and undetectable (ec+b500) or 10-fold lower (1.97, cfu/g; ec+lb) e. coli counts. all  pure cultures of commercial bacterial inoculants exhibited antibacterial activity independent of ph against e. coli o157:h7, but the ph-independent activity did not persist in the treated silages, suggesting that e. coli elimination from silages was mediated by ph reduction.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus buchneri and other additives on the fermentation and  aerobic stability of barley silage.
AB  == whole-plant barley (39.4% dry matter) was treated with various chemical and biological additives to assess their effects on silage fermentation and aerobic stability. treatments were untreated forage, forage treated with several amounts  of lactobacillus buchneri and enzymes (l. buchneri at 1 x 10(5), 5 x 10(5), and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage), forage treated with an inoculant containing (lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, propionibacterium freudenreichii, and enzymes), or forage treated with a buffered propionic acid-based additive (0.2% of fresh weight). sixty-nine d after ensiling, silages  treated with l. buchneri and enzymes had lower ph, but had higher concentrations  of acetic and propionic acids and higher concentrations of ethanol when compared  with untreated silage. silage treated with the multistrain inoculant containing l. plantarum had lower ph and higher concentrations of lactic acid, but lower concentrations of ammonia-n, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber than did untreated silage. the addition of the buffered propionic acid additive resulted in silage with higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acid compared  with untreated silage. numbers of yeasts in all silages were low at silo opening  (less than 3.0 log cfu/g) and were numerically the lowest in silages treated with l. buchneri but only treatment with the intermediate and high level of l. buchneri improved the aerobic stability of silage. because of the altered fermentation pattern, inoculation with l. buchneri, when applied at equal to or more than 5 x 10(5) cfu/g, and enzymes improved the aerobic stability of barley silage.
