anti-esbl activity of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized using soil streptomyces species.
emergence of antibiotic resistance by bacteria has become a serious threat for public health worldwide. in this study, streptomyces isolated from fertile soil sample was tested for biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using cell-free supernatant and synthesized agnps were screened for anti-esbl (extended spectrum b-lactamase) activity against multi-drug resistant (mdr) esbl-producing strain klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 700603) and other medically important pathogens. synthesis of agnps was confirmed by change in pale yellow color to dark brown color and characteristic absorption spectra at 420 nm. the xrd spectrum displayed typical peaks of crystalline silver and edax analysis showed a major signal for silver. ftir spectra revealed prominent peaks at 3,294 cm-1 (nh stretching due to amide group), 2,952 cm-1 (aldehydic c-h stretching) 1,658 cm-1 indicating the presence of carbonyl group. agnps were spherical in shape with size ranging from 20 to 70 nm. the synthesized agnps showed significant antimicrobial activity against standard esbl pathogen k. pneumoniae (22 mm), 21 mm against clinical esbl isolate e. coli and 16 mm against clinical esbl isolates k. pneumoniae and citrobacter species, respectively. the results of this study suggest that agnps synthesized by streptomyces sp. vitsjk10 can be used as a potential alternative to control mdr esbl pathogens. the present study aimed for green synthesis of agnps using streptomyces species and to explore its anti-esbl activity.
enterobacterial detection and escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance in parrots seized from the illegal wildlife trade.
enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the escherichia coli isolates cultured. fecal samples were collected from 300 parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in goias, brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. a total of 508 isolates were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 e. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 hafnia aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. these results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including e. coli strains with antimicrobial resistance.
antifungal and antibacterial activities of araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch heartwood lignans.
five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an meoh extract from araucaria araucana (mol.) k. koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. the antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria citrobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi mucor miehei, paecilomyces variotii, ceratocystis pilifera, trametes versicolor, and penicillium notatum, and in addition, the meoh extract was evaluated against aspergillus niger, candida albicans, fusarium moniliforme, f. sporotrichum and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the gram-positive. however, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of t. versicolor and c. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. on the other hand, the meoh extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as t. versicolor, fusarium spp. and trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
sub-mic ciprofloxacin effect on fimbrial production by uropathogenic escherichia  coli strains.
the urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (uti) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic escherichia coli isolates. forty-nine bacterial samples of density 10(5) cfu/ml were not considered. from the resulting 161 samples, e. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. other microoganisms found were: enterococcus sp. (34 samples), staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), proteus sp. (11), pseudomonas sp. (11), klebsiella sp. (8), enterobacter sp. (6), citrobacter sp. (3), and acinetobacter sp. (1). the uropathogenic e. coli strains found were p-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, sds-page of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (tem). all e. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 mic). our results showed that: 1) p-fimbriated e. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute uti (34%); 2) exposure to sub-mics of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production in 79% of e. coli strains; 3) the pattern of sds-page fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the protein at 18 kd known as p-fimbriae.
[effect of rokitamycin on bacterial flora in human feces].
rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. a dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. in changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. cases from which citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. among gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., gram-positive cocci did not show particular patterns of changes. no changes in mean count of total anaerobes were observed during the course of the experiment. among individual anaerobes, numbers of lactobacillus and peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. clostridium difficile d-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. the drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1 cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. the mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. the reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.
[susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
in vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (azt) against clinically isolated gram-negative bacteria were determined using mic-2000 plus system. bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in saga medical school during a period from may 1987 to march 1988. summarized results were as follows: 1. azt showed excellent antibacterial activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp. and haemophilus influenzae, and mic80 values of azt against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. antibacterial activities of azt were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. 3. the mic50 and mic80 of azt against pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. azt did not show any antibacterial activity against acinetobacter sp. and xanthomonas maltophilia.
inhibition of colonization of the chicken alimentary tract with salmonella typhimurium gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
oral administration of strains of food poisoning salmonellas to day-old chickens  produced a profound inhibition in the subsequent colonization of the caeca by a strain of salmonella typhimurium given one day later. closely related genera were unable to produce a similar inhibition. the inhibition was not the result of bacteriophages produced by the first strain. neither was it the result of an immunological response by the host induced by the first strain. in additional experiments in day-old chickens, inhibition of an escherichia coli nalr strain and of a citrobacter sp. nalr strain was produced by the antibiotic-sensitive forms of the homologous strains while strains from other genera did not produce any inhibition. when an avirulent mutant of s. typhimurium was used for pre-treatment a statistically significant reduction in the excretion of the super-infecting s. typhimurium nalr strain over several weeks was produced. a genus specific inhibition was reproduced in vitro by mixed culture experiments. live cultures were necessary for in vitro inhibition. killed cells or a culture supernatant produced no inhibition.
in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.
in vitro activity of new cephalosporins against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
the in vitro sensitivities of 47 multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli against six third generation cephalosporins were investigated. overall, moxalactam was the most active compound and cefoperazone the least active. ceftizoxime and ceftazidime were very active against enterobacteriaceae. ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime were active against escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., but were inactive against pseudomonas spp.; achromobacter sp. was resistant to all drugs, while citrobacter freundii was sensitive to every antibiotic tested. these drugs may be clinically useful in infections with multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects rna from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
short lengths (18 residues) of poly(a), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of escherichia coli 5 s rrna, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of rnaases (ribonucleases) from citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. as the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. furthermore, poly(a) sequences, present only on a small subpopulation of rna, and accounting for less than 1% of total rna, serve to protect all rna, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. the quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. the exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(a) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of rnaase activity, by using linked poly(a) and similar quantities of free poly(a), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits rnaase activity, covalent linkage of poly(a) to rna is more advantageous to the stability of an rna substrate. however, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(a) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.
