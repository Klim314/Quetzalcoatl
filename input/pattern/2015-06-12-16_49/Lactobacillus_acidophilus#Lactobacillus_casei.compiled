TI  - Effects of Baseplates of Orthodontic Appliances with in situ generated Silver Nanoparticles on Cariogenic Bacteria: A Randomized, Double-blind Cross-over Clinical Trial.
AB  - AIM: Polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (BOA). The activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. The PMMA incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (NanoAg-I-PMMA) and NanoAg in situ in PMMA (NanoAg-IS-PMMA) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. The main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using NanoAg-IS-PMMA and NanoAg-I-PMMA for construction of new BOA in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as Lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental BOA, NanoAg-IS-BOA and NanoAg-I-BOA, contained 0.5% w/w NanoAg while the control BOA was standard PMMA. Antibacterial effect of NanoAg-IS-BOA and NanoAg-I-BOA was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. RESULTS: The average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test BOA. Bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that NanoAg-I-BOA and NanoAg-IS-BOA inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to BOA. NanoAg-IS-BOA had a strong anti-bioflm effect against S. mutans, S. sobrinus and L. casei. However, NanoAg-I-BOA showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. Most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, NanoAg-IS-BOA showed a higher antibacterial activity than NanoAg-I-BOA. CONCLUSION: Based on the novel data that presented here, the NanoAg-IS-BOA had strong antimicrobial activity in the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Wearing of NanoAg-IS-BOA has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.
TI  - Innate immune response of pullets fed diets supplemented with prebiotics and synbiotics.
AB  - Prebiotics and synbiotics are considered to be among the most promising replacements for in-feed antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in poultry feed. The current study was designed to study the effect of Bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) (Control), yeast-derived carbohydrates (YDC), and a blend of YDC and probiotics [Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, and YDC] (SNB) in the performance and innate immune response of pullets. Feed intake and BW were measured on a weekly basis. At the end of the study (d 21), 10 birds/treatment were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and ileum, cecal tonsil, and spleen samples were collected for gene expression analysis. No significant difference (P > 0.05) in feed intake and G:F was observed among treatments. In the second and third wk age, higher BW gain was observed in SNB treatment compared to control and both control and YDC treatments, respectively. Expression of TLR2b was upregulated in YDC and SNB in the ileum, and in SNB in the spleen (P < 0.05). Expression of TLR4 was downregulated in SNB in the cecal tonsil. Expression of TLR21 was downregulated in YDC in the ileum, while it was upregulated in SNB in the spleen (P < 0.05). In the ileum, YDC resulted in downregulated IL-12p35, CxCLi2, and IL-13, and SNB resulted in upregulated IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and IL-4 (P < 0.05). In the cecal tonsil, YDC resulted in upregulated IL-12p35, IL-2, IL-13 and IL-10, and SNB resulted in downregulated IL-2 and upregulated IL-13 and IL-10 (P < 0.05). In the spleen, YDC resulted in dowregulated IL-2 and CxCLi2, and SNB resulted in upregulated IL-6, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, no change in performance was observed. Innate immune response analysis showed SNB with a more potent effect compared to YDC where the former showed a balanced T-helper (Th)-1/Th-2 response locally and a more Th-2-dependent response systemically; SNB might provide a more beneficial immune modulation with maintaining immune homeostasis, which was observed in a strong IL-10 response.
TI  - Distinctive Intestinal Lactobacillus Communities in Six-Month-Old Infants From Rural Malawi and South-Western Finland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare the composition and diversity of Lactobacillus microbiota in infants living in Malawi and south-western Finland. METHODS: The composition and diversity of the Lactobacillus group was analyzed in the feces of healthy six-month-old infants living in rural Malawi (n = 44) and south-western Finland (n = 31), using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (qPCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (DGGE). RESULTS: Malawian infants had higher counts of lactobacilli than their Finnish counterparts (7.45 log cells/g vs. 6.86 log cells/g, p < 0.001, respectively) and the Lactobacillus community was richer and more diverse in the Malawian infants. Leuconostoc citreum and Weissella confusa were the predominant species in both study groups, but Malawian infants were more often colonized by these species (100 % vs. 74.2 % p < 0.001; 95.5 % vs. 41.9 %, p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus mucosae were detected more often in the Malawian infants (59.1 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 38.6 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.004; 29.5 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 22.7 % vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.017, respectively). However, Lactobacillus casei group species were only detected in the Finnish infants. CONCLUSIONS: Malawian infants have a more abundant Lactobacillus microbiota with a distinct composition compared to Finnish infants. The environment, including diet and hygiene, may be among the factors influencing these differences.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Donkey Milk for Manufacture of Novel Functional Fermented Beverages.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate on the functional features of a donkey milk probiotic berevage as a novel food. Particularly, it was to study the decrease of lactose content and the antioxidant activity of standard yogurt (YC) and probiotic yogurt (YP; Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei) from donkey milk during the storage up to 30 d at 4 masculineC. The evolution of lactose content using enzymatic-spectrophotometric kits was analyzed. Antioxidant activity of yogurt was measured using 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and thiol assays. Parallel consumer sensory studies were carried out as consumer test in order to gain information about the impact of these novel fermented beverages on sensory perceptions. The statistical analysis has shown significant effect of studied factors. The results showed that the lactose content gradually decreased during storage in both yogurts, reaching values of 2.36% and 2.10% in YC and YP, respectively, at 30 d (P < 0.05). During storage of both yogurt types, the antioxidant activity increased, but YP showed a higher antioxidant activity than YC. The results suggest that the antioxidant activity of yogurt samples was affected by cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). We conclude that the fermented donkey milk could be configured as health and nutraceutical food, which aims to meet nutritional requirements of certain consumers groups with lactose or cow milk protein intolerance.
TI  - Lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. Although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens. They are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. Their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute and International Dairy Foundation. Their use as probiotics for prevention of Clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. Lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. They are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with L. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas L. rhamnosus and L. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.
TI  - A Decade of Experience in Primary Prevention of Clostridium difficile Infection at a Community Hospital Using the Probiotic Combination Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (Bio-K+).
AB  - In August 2003, the 284-bed community hospital Pierre-Le Gardeur (PLGH) in Quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the Clostridium difficile NAP1/027/BI strain. Augmented standard preventive measures (SPMs) were not able to control this outbreak. It was decided in February 2004 to give to every adult inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (Bio-K+: Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. Augmented SPMs were continued. The use of the probiotic in addition to SPMs was associated with a marked reduction of C. difficile infection (CDI). During the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received Bio-K+, and the CDI rate at PLGH declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. Additionally, 10-year data collected by the Ministry of Health in Quebec comparing the CDI rate between Quebec hospitals showed that CDI rates at PLGH were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. Blood cultures were monitored at PLGH for Lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no Lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. Despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic Bio-K+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary CDI rate.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (Bio-K+): Characterization, Manufacture, Mechanisms of Action, and Quality Control of a Specific Probiotic Combination for Primary Prevention of Clostridium difficile Infection.
AB  - A specific probiotic formulation composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, Lactobacillus casei LBC80R, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (Bio-K+) has been marketed in North America since 1996. The strains and the commercial products have been evaluated for safety, identity, gastrointestinal survival, and stability throughout shelf life. The capacity of both the fermented beverages and the capsules to reduce incidences of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been demonstrated in human clinical trials. Individual strains and the finished products have shown antimicrobial activity against C. difficile and toxin A/B neutralization capacity in vitro. The use of this specific probiotic formulation as part of a bundle of preventive measures to control CDI in healthcare settings is discussed.
TI  - Effect of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glycemic control and lipid profile  in type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global health problem in the world. Probiotic food has  anti-diabetic property. The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glucose and lipid profile control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 diabetic patients aged 35 to 65 years.Patients were randomly and equally (n=30) assigned to consume either probiotic fermented milk (kefir) or conventional fermented milk (dough) for 8 weeks. Probiotic group consumed 600 ml/day probiotic fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria and control group consumed 600 ml/day conventional fermented milk.Blood samples tested for fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C at the baseline and end of the study. RESULTS: The comparison of fasting blood glucose between two groups after intervention was statistically significant (P=0.01). After intervention, reduced HbA1C compared with the baseline value in probiotic fermented milk group was statistically significant (P=0.001), also the HbA1C level significantly decreased in probiotic group in comparison with control group (P=0.02) adjusting for serum levels of glucose, baseline values of HbA1c and energy intake according to ANCOVA model. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL- cholesterol levels were not shown significant differences between and within the groups after intervention. CONCLUSION: Probiotic fermented milk can be useful as a complementary or adjuvant therapy in the treatment of diabetes.
TI  - A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. OBJECTIVE: Heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. The present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus brevis W63, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus salivarius W24, and Lactococcus lactis (W19 and W58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. DESIGN: In a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo for the same period. In the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised Leiden index of depression sensitivity scale. RESULTS: Compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. Probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for depression.
TI  - Effect of salt on cell viability and membrane integrity of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum as observed by flow cytometry.
AB  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of varying sodium chloride concentrations (0-5%) on viability and membrane integrity of three probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum, using conventional technique and flow cytometry. Double staining of cells by carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) and propidium iodide (PI) enabled to evaluate the effect of NaCl on cell esterase activity and membrane integrity. Observations from conventional culture technique were compared with findings from flow cytometric analysis on the metabolic activities of the cells and a correlation was observed between culturability and dye extrusion ability of L. casei and B. longum. However, a certain population of L. acidophilus was viable as per the plate count method but its efflux activity was compromised. Esterase activity of most bacteria reduced significantly (P < 0.05) during one week storage at NaCl concentrations greater than 3.5%. The study revealed that L. casei was least affected by higher NaCl concentrations among the three probiotic bacteria, as opposed to B. longum where the cF extrusion performance was greatly reduced during 1 wk storage. The metabolic activity and salt resistance of L. casei was found to be highest among the bacteria studied.
TI  - Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (CDD) in older patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to May 2014. Only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older patients (age >/=65 years) were included. Risk ratios (RRs) for AAD and CDD relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. RESULTS: Six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. Only one trial showed that Bacillus licheniformis was effective for preventing AAD in older patients. However, there was no preventive effect for AAD and CDD with Lactobacillus acidophilus (Florajen), Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Cultech strains), and mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60, CUL21, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 and B. lactis CUL34. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of AAD and CDD in older patients. However, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. To confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.
TI  - Perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  - Periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. Some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. We evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (PNs) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group S [Lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)CFU, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HS 111, 1 x 10(9) CFU, Lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9) CFU, Bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)CFU, and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) 100 mg]--or placebo-controls--group C, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. Risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. Twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. The incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group S (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group C (16 of 23 patients, 69.6%) (P = 0.00). Duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group S (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group C; P = 0.01). Noninfectious complications were less common in group S (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group C; P = 0.03). Mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group S vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group C (P = 0.00). No deaths occurred in group S, whereas 6 deaths occurred in group C (P = 0.02). Perioperative administration of synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for PNs.
TI  - Different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions: Microhardness and polarized light miscroscopy analyses.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions by microhardness and polarized light microscopy analyses. One hundred blocks of bovine enamel were randomly divided into four groups (n = 25) according to the bacterial model for caries induction: (A) Streptococcus mutans, (B) S. mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus, (C) S. mutans and L. casei, and (D) S. mutans, L. acidophilus, and L. casei. Within each group, the blocks were randomly divided into five subgroups according to the duration of the period of caries induction (4-20 days). The enamel blocks were immersed in cariogenic solution containing the microorganisms, which was changed every 48 h. Groups C and D presented lower surface hardness values (SMH) and higher area of hardness loss (DeltaS) after the cariogenic challenge than groups A and B (P < 0.05). As regards lesion depth, under polarized light microscopy, group A presented significantly lower values, and groups C and D the highest values. Group B showed a higher value than group A (P < 0.05). Groups A and B exhibited subsurface caries lesions after all treatment durations, while groups C and D presented erosion-type lesions with surface softening. The model using S. mutans, whether or not it was associated with L. acidophilus, was less aggressive and may be used for the induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions. The optimal period for inducing caries-like lesions was 8 days. Microsc. Res. Tech. 78:444-451, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
TI  - Effects of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on colorectal tumor cells activity (CaCo-2).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The probiotic microorganisms are live normal flora that provide nutritional benefits. When probiotic administered in adequate amounts, they also confer a health benefit on the host. Different mechanisms of probiotic effects include the following: stimulating the immune system, modifying the composition of normal intestinal flora and preventing the carcinogenic activity of fecal enzymes. In this study, direct effects of probiotic lactobacilli on tumor cells were investigated. METHODS: Supernatants and bacterial extracts of two standard Lactobacillus species (L. acidophilus and L. casei) were prepared and CaCo-2 cells were treated with them. Probiotic effects on cell proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed. RESULTS: The supernatants of Lactobacilli decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis, however, no significant effect on cell necrosis was reported. In contrast, Lactobacilli extract, reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis. Lactobacilli extract also led to cell necrosis. Furthermore, both supernatants and cell extracts of the probiotic agents resulted in decreased cells' migration and invasion. CONCLUSION: In this study, it was shown that Lactobacilli probiotics useful effects are not confined to the enhancement of the immune system; however, they effectively suppress the malignant phenotypes of colorectal cancer cells.
TI  - The effects of probiotics on treatment of Helicobacter pylori eradication in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the eradication rates and side effects of probiotics added in standard triple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). METHODS: A prospective open study was performed in the outpatient clinics of the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, School of Medicine, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey between March 2012 and May 2013. Sixty-one symptomatic children (range 7-18 years) with H. pylori infection were randomized to 2 groups: group 1 received standard triple therapy (lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 14 days), group 2 received the standard triple therapy plus probiotics (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis). Side effects of the drugs were recorded. The 14C-urea breath test was performed for 6 weeks after discontinuation of the therapy. RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori infection was detected in 61 of 95 (64.2%) children. Fifty-six patients (38 girls and 18 boys) completed the study. Their mean age was 13.9 +/- 2.7 years. Helicobacter pylori eradication rate was 68.9% in group 1, and 66.6% in group 2 (p=0.78). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of side effects. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence in terms of eradication of H. pylori, or impact on adverse effects obtained after the addition of probiotics to standard treatment. Larger randomized controlled investigations are needed to clearly understand the effects of probiotics on H. pylori eradication.
TI  - [Biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from Lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  - The biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (RF) from  Luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. The RF showed the protective and reactivating effects on the Bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. Also, it acted as a cryoprotector during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. The RF and the L. casei culture liquid (CL) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. The degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. The maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in Lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of Lactobacillus reuterii. The resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, and L. reuterii correlating with the RF protection degree.
TI  - Evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the suitability of Transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (TOS-MUP) and MRS-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (MRS-CC) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species commonly used to make fermented milks. Pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. TOS-MUP agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and B. breve M-16 V. MRS-CC agar showed relatively good selectivity for Lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of Lb. casei strains. For this reason, MRS-CC agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of Lb. acidophilus if Lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of Lb. acidophilus. Unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped LAB, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in MRS pH 5.4 agar incubated under anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of Lactobacillus spp.
TI  - The effect of probiotics supplementation on Helicobacter pylori eradication rates and side effects during eradication therapy: a meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses reported that probiotics improve the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication during antibiotic therapy, while results regarding a possible reduction of side effects remained inconclusive. Moreover, the effectiveness of different strains of probiotics has not been studied so far. It is further conceivable that probiotics will produce additional effects only if antibiotics are relatively ineffective. METHODS: This meta-analysis includes eligible randomized controlled trials examining effects of probiotics supplementation on eradication rates (ER) and side effects, published up to May 2014. Sub-group analysis was performed to compare different probiotic strains and antibiotic therapies with different effectiveness in controls (ER <80% vs.>80%). Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Harbord's test. The quality of the trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Thirty-three RCTs involving a total of 4459 patients met the inclusion criteria in case of eradication rates of which 20 assessed total side effects in addition. Overall, the pooled eradication rate in probiotics supplementation groups was significantly higher than in controls (ITT analysis: RR 1.122, 95% CI 1.086-1.159, PP analysis: RR 1.114, 95% CI 1.070-1.159). Sub group-analysis could, however, confirm this finding only for four individual strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Bifidobacterium infantis 2036) and for relatively ineffective antibiotic therapies. There was a significant difference between groups in the overall incidence of side effects (RR 0.735, 95% CI 0.598-0.902). This result was, however, only confirmed for non-blinded trials. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled data suggest that supplementation with specific strains of probiotics compared with eradication therapy may be considered an option for increasing eradication rates, particularly when antibiotic therapies are relatively ineffective. The impact on side effects remains unclear and more high quality trials on specific probiotic strains and side effects are thus needed.
TI  - Effect of the bread-making process on zearalenone levels.
AB  - The effects of the bread-making process including fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus fermentum) and baking at 200 degrees C on zearalenone (ZEA) levels were investigated. Standard solutions of ZEA were added to flour and then loaves of bread were prepared. Sourdough and three types of yeast including active dry yeast, instant dry yeast and compressed yeast were used for the fermentation of dough. ZEA levels in flour, dough and bread were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection after extraction and clean-up on an immunoaffinity column. The highest reduction in levels of ZEA was found in the first fermentation (first proof), while the lowest reduction was observed in the baking stage. In addition, the results showed that compressed yeast had the maximum reduction potential on ZEA levels even at the baking stage.
TI  - Effects of probiotic yogurt on fat distribution and gene expression of proinflammatory factors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in overweight and obese people with or without weight-loss diet.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether probiotics had an effect on proinflammatory markers and cytokines in overweight and obese individuals and whether they could have synergistic effects with weight-loss diets. METHODS: A total of 75 healthy overweight and obese individuals completed this randomized doubled-blind controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to groups consuming regular yogurt with a low-calorie diet (LCD, RLCD; n = 25) or receiving probiotic yogurt with LCD (PLCD; n = 25) or consuming probiotic yogurt without LCD (PWLCD; n = 25) for 8 weeks. The pribiotic regimen contained 200 g/day yogurt, enriched by Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium BB12, and Lactobacillus casei DN001 10(8) colony-forming units/g. Body fat percentage, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leptin, and mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes (TNF-alpha and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma [ROR-gammat]) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured. RESULTS: A reduction in body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, and leptin level was observed that was more obvious in groups who received the weight-loss diet with probiotic yogurt. Reduction in the gene expression of ROR-gammat was significant in the PLCD group (p < 0.001). The expression of TNF-alpha did not change among all groups after intervention. The mean concentration of leptin was significantly decreased in all groups after the dietary intervention, but the mean changes in leptin level in the PLCD group was more prominent compared to the other two groups (-2.38, p < 0.001 [PLCD] vs -1.75, p = 0.002 [RLCD] and -0.55 ng/mL, p = 0.12 [PWLCD]). The reduction in serum levels of hs-CRP was more evident in the PWLCD group compared to the PLCD and RLCD groups after the 8-week intervention (-3.4, p = 0.03 vs -1.76, p < 0.001 and -2.98 pg/mL, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the weight-loss diet and probiotic yogurt had synergistic effects on T-cells subset specific gene expression in PBMCs, fat percentage, and body weight among overweight and obese individuals.
TI  - Effect of KCl substitution on bacterial viability of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  - Excessive intake of NaCl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. Strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of NaCl with other salts, such as KCl. In this study, the effects of NaCl reduction and its substitution with KCl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (Escherichia coli) were investigated using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A critical NaCl concentration that inhibited the viability of E. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. To find the critical NaCl concentration, de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) broth was supplemented with a range of NaCl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and FTIR spectra was monitored for all bacteria. A NaCl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of NaCl to inhibit E. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. The FTIR spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the NaCl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of the bacteria. Escherichia coli and B. longum were more sensitive to substitution of NaCl with KCl, compared with Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei, and Lc. lactis ssp. lactis. To evaluate the effect of substitution of NaCl with KCl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% KCl). The findings suggest that 50% substitution of NaCl with KCl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit E. coli without affecting the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Development of synbiotics with inulin, palatinose, alpha-cyclodextrin and probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Success in creating a synbiotic depends on compatibility between the chosen components--prebiotic and probiotic. In this work the interactions between Lactobacillus sp. strains isolated from yogurts and type strains of Lactobacillus sp. and Lactococcus sp., and the dependence of their growth and antibacterial activity on three oligosaccharides (OS)--palatinose, inulin and alpha-cyclodextrin were investigated. All isolated lactobacilli produce antibacterial compounds, which possibly are the bacteriocins of Lactobacillus casei ATCC334 strain. Results of growth analysis with different OS revealed that part of lactobacilli isolated from yogurts can effectively ferment inulin and may be used for the development of synbiotics. Palatinose and Lactobacillus acidophilus could be used as symbiotics with effective antibacterial activity. One of the types of Lactococcus sp. strains can assimilate palatinose and alpha-cyclodextrin, so they both can be used as components of synbiotics with the investigated lactococci. Results of this analysis suggest that the investigated isolated and type strains of Lactobacillus sp. and Lactoccocus sp. can be useful as probiotics in the development of synbiotics. Together with prebiotics--palatinose, inulin and alpha-cyclodextrin, the synbiotics, which could regulate not only the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, but also their antibacterial activity, can be created.
TI  - Fermentation adaptability of three probiotic Lactobacillus strains to oat, germinated oat and malted oat substrates.
AB  - Functional foods targeting the improvement of gastrointestinal health are widely  recognized; of these, dairy-based probiotics are the most popular. Thus, the design of nondairy probiotics applying fruits, vegetables and cereals has raised great interest in the healthy food sector. The objective of this work was to assess the potential of germinated and malted oat substrates to support the growth of the probiotic cultures Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Fermentations were carried out with distinctive oat substrates at inoculum levels of 3, 5 and 7% v/v, substrate concentrations of 3, 5 and 7% w/v and with sucrose addition 1.5% w/v. Lag phase profiles, maximum growth rates and maximal growths were evaluated; protein and sugar contents were also quantified. There was no significant effect (P > 0.05) of the inoculum size on the fermentation kinetics; however, oat media significantly affected the growth kinetics. In simple oat media, Lact. acidophilus exhibited biphasic growth patterns. Lactobacillus growth patterns were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by the supplementation with protein sources. The germination and malting processes significantly improved oats nutrient characteristics demonstrating to be adequate substrates for the fermentation with probiotic lactobacilli. Significance and impact of the study: In this work, the effect of oat media composition and fermentation conditions on the growth kinetics of three probiotic lactobacilli was determined. The variation in the inoculum levels did not have a significant effect on the probiotic cultures growth. Results revealed that protein supplemented simple, germinated and malted oat enhanced the cell viability of the probiotic lactobacilli; Lactobacillus casei exhibited better growth adaptability. The results also highlight that different weight in volume oat substrate concentrations has particular effects on Lact. casei growth kinetics. Our results contribute to a better understanding of oat-based media formulations as substrates for probiotic cultures.
TI  - Synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - AIM: Infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. Results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. In a randomised clinical trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. METHODS: Fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion CFU of: Lactobacillus casei, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, L. acidophilus, B. infantis, L. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (Protexin Healthcare, Somerset, UK), or placebo daily for 30 days. Parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. The primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). RESULTS: The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (P < 0.005). At day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (P < 0.01). Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (P < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, P = 0.24). We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. CONCLUSION: This synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.
TI  - A comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  - Dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing Streptococcus mutans. Probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. However, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. In this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. The antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. Probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including S. mutans. The oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. To count bacteria in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on MSB and BHI agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. Glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of S. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Among probiotics, Lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. Moreover, Lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. The expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The integration of L. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. However, L. acidophilus and L casei integrated into the biofilm model. These results suggest that L. rhamnosus may inhibit oral biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of S. mutans and antibacterial activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria survive in Cheddar cheese and modify populations of other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: Starter lactic acid bacteria in Cheddar cheese face physico-chemical stresses during manufacture and ageing that alter their abilities to survive and to interact with other bacterial populations. Nonstarter bacteria are derived from milk handling, cheese equipment and human contact during manufacture. Probiotic bacteria are added to foods for human health benefits that also encounter physiological stresses and microbial competition that may mitigate their survival during ageing. We added probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis to full-fat, reduced-fat and low-fat Cheddar cheeses, aiming to study their survival over 270 days of ageing and to determine the role of the cheese matrix in their survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic and other lactic acid bacterial populations were enumerated by quantitative PCR using primers specifically targeting the different bacterial genera or species of interest. Bifidobacteria were initially added at 10(6) CFU g(-1) cheese and survived variably in the different cheeses over the 270-day ageing process. Probiotic lactobacilli that were added at 10(7) CFU g(-1) cheese and incident nonstarter lactobacilli (initially at 10(8) CFU g(-1) cheese) increased by 10- to 100-fold over 270 days. Viable bacterial populations were differentiated using propidium monoazide followed by species-specific qPCR assays, which demonstrated that the starter and probiotic microbes survived over ageing, independent of cheese type. Addition of probiotic bacteria, at levels 100-fold below that of starter bacteria, modified starter and nonstarter bacterial levels. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that starter lactococci, nonstarter lactobacilli and probiotic bacteria are capable of surviving throughout the cheesemaking and ageing process, indicating that delivery via hard cheeses is possible. Probiotic addition at lower levels may also alter starter and nonstarter bacterial survival. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We applied qPCR to study multispecies survival and viability and distinctly enumerated bacterial species in commercial-scale Cheddar cheese manufacture.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. Little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. Six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees C), as well as sensory preference among them. Decreases in pH (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. Only the yogurt with S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and L. reuteri differed in firmness. No differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. Syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. No changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. Counts of S. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. Counts of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. Probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/mL for 3 wk. Probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of L. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/mL for 35 d, of L. casei for 7d, and of L. reuteri for 14 d. We found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. However, the yogurt and fermented milk made with L. casei were better accepted. This study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.
TI  - Effect of Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) on survivability, extent of proteolysis and ACE inhibition of potential probiotic cultures in fermented milk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present investigation, the effect of Aloe vera gel powder on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, extent of proteolysis during fermentation and survival of Lactobacillus casei NCDC19 during storage of fermented milk was studied. RESULTS: Among the different cultures screened for ACE inhibitory activity, Lactobacillus casei NCDC 19 exhibited the highest ACE inhibition (approx. 40%) as well as extent of proteolysis (0.37, Abs(3)(4)(0)). In the presence of Aloe vera (0.5% and 1% w/v) an increase in extent of proteolysis (0.460 +/- 0.047 and 0.480 +/- 0.027) and percent ACE inhibitory activity (44.32 +/- 2.83 and 47.52 +/- 1.83) was observed in comparison to control. Aloe vera powder addition also led to an increase in viable counts (>11 log cfu mL(-)(1)) of L. casei NCDC 19 in fermented milk during storage for 7 days and the counts were maintained in sufficiently higher numbers. CONCLUSION: The study suggests Aloe vera to be a good functional ingredient which can be further explored for different health attributes.
TI  - Anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  - A vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. Resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. The mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. The human intestinal microbiota is a source from which Lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. Only six probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., L. rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota YIT9029, L. casei DN-114 001, L. johnsonii NCC 533, L. acidophilus LB, and L. reuteri DSM 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. In this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic Lactobacillus strains. What is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic Lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Characterization of pMC11, a plasmid with dual origins of replication isolated from Lactobacillus casei MCJ and construction of shuttle vectors with each replicon.
AB  - Many lactic acid bacteria carry different plasmids, particularly those that replicate via a theta mechanism. Here we describe Lactobacillus casei MCJ(CCTCC AB20130356), a new isolate that contains pMC11, carrying two distinct theta-type replicons. Each replicon contained an iteron in the origin of replication (oriV1 or oriV2) and a gene coding for the replicase (RepA_1 or RepB_1), both of which are essential for plasmid replication. Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vectors were constructed with each replicon, yielding pEL5.7 and pEL5.6 that are based on oriV2 and oriV1 replicons, respectively. These plasmids showed distinct properties: pEL5.7 was capable of replicating in L. casei MCJDelta1 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 but failed to do so in two other tested lactobacilli strains whereas pEL5.6 replicated in three different strains, including L. casei MCJDelta1, L. casei NJ, Lactobacillus paracasei LPC-37 and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1. Plasmid stability was studied: pEL5.6 and pEL5.7 were very stably maintained in L. casei, as the loss rate was lower than 1 % per generation. pEL5.7 was also stable in L. delbrueckii subsp. lactic LBCH-1 with the loss rate estimated to be 3 %. These vectors were employed to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP) using the promoter of S-layer protein SlpA from Lactobacillus acidophilus. And a growth-phase regulated expression of GFP was observed in different strains. In conclusion, these shuttle vectors provide efficient genetic tools for DNA cloning and heterologous gene expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Plasmin digest of kappa-casein as a source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial properties of plasmin, the plasmin hydrolysis of bovine kappa-casein and the fractions (named kappaC1, kappaC2, kappaC3, kappaC4, and kappaC5) liberated from it using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic). Three peptides (kC1, kC3, and kC4) were found to have antibacterial activity, with kappaC3 peptide being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine kappa-casein proved to be stronger than any of its fractions in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed that Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC of nisin, as a bacteriocin peptide, was also measured. The three antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular mass of kC1, kC3, and kC4 corresponded to the f(17-21), f(22-24), and f(1-3) of bovine kappa-casein, respectively. It was also found that the positive charge and hydrophobicity of a peptide are not key factors in antibacterial activity. On the whole, the present study demonstrated that the plasmin digest of kappa-casein has a high antibacterial potential and can be considered as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of crude peptide extract from yogurt.
AB  - Search for bioactive peptides is intensifying because of the risks associated with the use of synthetic therapeutics, thus peptide liberation by lactic acid bacteria and probiotics has received a great focus. However, proteolytic capacity of these bacteria is strain specific. The study was conducted to establish proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC(R) 4356), Lactobacillus casei (ATCC(R) 393) and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (ATCC(R) BAA52) in yogurt. Crude peptides were separated by high-speed centrifugation and tested for antioxidant and antimutagenic activities. The degree of proteolysis highly correlated with these bioactivities, and its value (11.91%) for samples containing all the cultures was double that of the control. Liberated peptides showed high radical scavenging activities with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), IC50 1.51 and 1.63mg/ml, respectively and strong antimutagenicity (26.35%). These probiotics enhanced the generation of bioactive peptides and could possibly be commercially applied in new products, or production of novel anticancer peptides.
TI  - Construction of a food-grade cell surface display system for Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - In this study, a food-grade cell surface display host/vector system for Lactobacillus casei was constructed. The food-grade host L. casei Q-5 was a lactose-deficient derivative of L. casei ATCC 334 obtained by plasmid elimination. The food-grade cell surface display vector was constructed based on safe DNA elements from lactic acid bacteria containing the following: pSH71 replicon from Lactococcus lactis, lactose metabolism genes from L. casei ATCC 334 as complementation markers, and surface layer protein gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 for cell surface display. The feasibility of the new host/vector system was verified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) on L. casei. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis using anti-GFP antibody confirmed that GFP was anchored on the surface of the recombinant cells. The stability of recombinant L. casei cells in artificial gastrointestinal conditions was verified, which is beneficial for oral vaccination applications. These results indicate that the food-grade host/vector system can be an excellent antigen delivery vehicle in oral vaccine construction.
TI  - Antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  - In this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (including 5 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 Lactobacillus fermentum, 1 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 Lactobacillus plantarum, 1 Lactobacillus sakei, and 1 Lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum, and Aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (PLA). Results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (CFS) from LAB fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. The inhibition ability of CFS was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees C, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the pH of CFS was adjusted to 6.5. With the exception of L. plantarum NRRL B-4496 and L. acidophilus ATCC-4495, all other LAB strains produced PLA ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mM. The high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial PLA (3.01-36.10mM) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied LAB and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare MALDI-TOF results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific PCR. METHODS: The 87 isolates were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex LT, MALDI Biotyper 3.0, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. For the identification with species-specific PCR, oligonucleotide primers (16S rRNA) specific for L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. The PCR-products were separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. RESULTS: For 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as L. rhamnosus, 16 as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as L. paracasei, 3 as L. gasseri, 2 as L. plantarum, and 1 as L. casei. In 4.5% of the cases the results were discordant. Of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific PCR, 1 strain was identified by MALDI-TOF MS as L. spec. and 1 as L. parabuchneri. One strain could not be identified by either method. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods are highly sensitive. Limitations can be the precision of the primers (PCR) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. Additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.
TI  - Development of an alternative culture medium for the selective enumeration of Lactobacillus casei in fermented milk.
AB  - Monitoring the populations of probiotic strains of the species Lactobacillus casei in food is required by food industries in order to assure that a minimum concentration of these organisms will be ingested by consumers. In this context, Petrifilm AC plates can be used along with selective culture media to allow the enumeration of specific groups of lactic acid bacteria. The present study aimed to assess chemical substances as selective agents for Lb. casei in order to propose a selective culture medium to be used with Petrifilm AC plates as an alternative protocol for the enumeration of probiotic strains of this species in fermented milk. Twenty-six probiotic and starter cultures (including six strains of Lb. casei) were plated on de Man Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar with distinct concentrations of nalidixic acid, bile, lithium chloride, metronidazole, sodium propionate, and vancomycin. Vancomycin at 10 mg/L demonstrated selective activity for Lb. casei. In addition, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chlorine was identified as a compound that did not inhibit Lb. casei, and Petrifilm AC plates used with MRS and vancomycin at 10 mg/L (MRS-V) demonstrated more colonies of this organism when incubated under anaerobic conditions than aerobic conditions. Acidophilus milk and yoghurt were prepared, added to Lb. casei strains, and stored at 4 degrees C. Lb. casei populations were monitored using MRS-V and MRTLV by conventional plating and associated with Petrifilm AC plates. All correlation indices between counts obtained by conventional plating and Petrifilm AC were significant (p < 0.05), but the best performance was observed for growth on MRS-V. The obtained data indicate the efficiency of using MRS-V associated with Petrifilm AC plates for the enumeration of Lb. casei strains in fermented milk. However, the selective potential of this culture medium must be evaluated considering the specific strains of Lb. casei and the starter cultures inoculated in the fermented milk that requires monitoring.
TI  - [Identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: LABs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16S rRNA sequence. Genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). The sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all LAB isolates by Kirby-Bauer paper diffusion (K-B method). Meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including erythromycin resistance genes (ermA and ermB) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetM, tetK, tetS, tetQ, tetO, tetL and tetW), were detected by PCR amplification in the identified LAB isolates. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Total 100 LABs were isolated, including 23 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 Lactobacillus casei, 30 Streptococcus thermophilus, 5 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 Lactobacillus paracasei. The drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. Moreover, 5 ARGs were found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermB gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet K in 4 isolates, tetL in 2 isolates, tetM in 4 isolates, tetO in 2 isolates. erm A, tet S, tet Q and tet W genes were not detected in the isolates. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSIONS: Some LABs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. Antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. All the LAB isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. We proved again that LAB could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - Probiotics: a comprehensive approach toward health foods.
AB  - Food products containing probiotics and prebiotics are an important development in Health foods, which enhance health promoting microbial flora in the intestine. Probiotic refers to viable microorganism that promotes or support a beneficial balance of the autochthonous microbial population of the gastrointestinal tract. A number of genera of bacteria (and yeast) are used as probiotics, including Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, and Enterococcus, but the main species believed to have probiotic characteristics are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and L. casei. Probiotics can reduce diarrheal incidence, lactose intolerance, lower serum cholesterol, stimulate the immune system, control infections, act as antibiotics, suppress tumors, and protect against colon or bladder cancer by maintaining a healthy intestinal microflora balance. Lactic acid bacteria produce biopreservatives such as lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins that are used to retard both spoilage and the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Food, particularly dairy products are considered as an ideal vehicle for delivering probiotic bacteria to the human gastrointestinal tract. Cereals being rich source of prebiotics such as beta-glucan and arabinoxylan, galacto-, and fructooligosaccharides are considered for development of probiotic foods. Good manufacturing practices must be applied in the manufacture of probiotic foods with quality assurance, and shelf-life conditions established.
TI  - Role of Lactobacillus in the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to Lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus in the prevention of CDAD. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, National Institutes of Health, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (RCT) from 1990 to December 2012. Only RCT in English and Chinese using Lactobacillus for the prevention of documented CDAD were considered for study inclusion. The data was analyzed by Review Manager and SPSS software. RESULTS: Seven placebo-controlled RCTs that evaluated the prevention of CDAD, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. The total daily dose of Lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (CFU). A low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. The combined risk ratio (RR) of developing CDAD was significantly lower in subjects who received Lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (RR 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.67). A combination regimen of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of CDAD, while single regimens of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) did not. Across all trials, positive significant effects of Lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.36). Whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) CFU/d Lactobacillus could prevent CDAD significantly or not was unclear. CONCLUSION: There is a sufficient evidence to recommend Lactobacillus (L. acidophilus and L. casei) as a prevention therapy for CDAD.
TI  - Bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  - There is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. We performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: Bifidobacterium infantis (Align((R))); Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) (Bio-K+((R))); Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (Culturelle((R))); Saccharomyces boulardii (Florastor((R))) and "L. acidophilus" and "Lactobacillus helveticus" (Lactinex((R))). Approximately 1 g of powder of each (Lactinex((R)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the Saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. The Florastor((R)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) CFU/g. Lactinex((R)), Align((R)), Bio-K+((R)), and Culturelle((R)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.
TI  - Antipathogenic activity of probiotics against Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  - Probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: Lactobacillus casei NCIMB 30185 (PXN 37), Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30184 (PXN 35), Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 30180 (PXN 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera on the survival of Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile using pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. Changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. Quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). There was also a significant reduction in S. Typhimurium and C. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. Of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely L. casei NCIMB 30185 (PXN 37), and B. breve NCIMB 30180 (PXN 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of S. Typhimurium and C. difficile. In addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. Acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium BB12, and Lactobacillus casei DN001 modulate gene expression of subset specific transcription factors and cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of obese and overweight people.
AB  - Probiotics are believed to have interaction with immune cells through sustained effects on gene expression of different cytokines and transcription factors. The present randomized doubled-blind controlled clinical trial was performed recruiting 75 individuals with BMI 25-35, who were randomly assigned to the following three groups: Group 1 (n = 25) who consumed regular yogurt as part of a low calorie diet [RLCD], group 2 (n = 25) who received probiotic yogurt with a LCD [PLCD] and group 3 (n = 25) who consumed probiotic yogurt without LCD [PWLCD] for 8 week. Participants in PLCD and PWLCD groups received 200 g/day yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium Bb12, and lactobacillus casei DN001 10(8) cfu/gr. The expression of the FOXP3, T-bet, GATA3, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, and ROR-gammat in PBMCs genes were assessed, before and after intervention. In three groups, ROR-gammat expression was reduced (P = 0.007) and FOXP3 was increased (P < 0.001). The expression of TNFalpha, TGFbeta, and GATA3 genes did not change among all groups after intervention. Interestingly, the expression of T-bet gene, which was significantly decreased in PLCD and PWLCD groups (P < 0.001), whereas gene expression of IFN-gamma decreased in all three groups. Our results suggest that weight loss diet and probiotic yogurt had synergistic effects on T-cell subset specific gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells among overweight and obese individuals.
TI  - Anticariogenic and phytochemical evaluation of Eucalyptus globules Labill.
AB  - In the present study, in vitro anticariogenic potential of ethyl acetate, hexane  and methanol and aqueous extracts of plant leaves of Eucalyptus globules Labill. were evaluated by using four cariogenic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The ethyl acetate extracted fraction of plant leaves showed good inhibitory effects against all selected bacteria. In Eucalyptus globules, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts found highly effective against, Lactobacillus acidophilus with MIC value of 0.031 and 0.062 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative phytochemical investigation of above extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, steroids, cardiac glycosides and terpenes. Based on the MIC value and bioautography, ethyl acetate of plant leaf was selected for further study. Further investigation on the structure elucidation of the bioactive compound using IR, GC-MS and NMR techniques revealed the presence of alpha-farnesene, a sesquiterpene. Eucalyptus globules plant leaf extracts have great potential as anticariogenic agents that may be useful in the treatment of oral disease.
TI  - Impact of adding prophylactic probiotics to a bundle of standard preventative measures for Clostridium difficile infections: enhanced and sustained decrease in the incidence and severity of infection at a community hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2003, hospitals in Quebec, Canada experienced an increase of NAP1/027 Clostridium difficile infections following antibiotic administration (CDIAA). At Pierre-Le Gardeur Hospital (PLGH), the incidence increased from 10 to over 25 cases per 1000 patient admissions. METHODS: We report a quasi-experimental, prospective cohort study evaluating the effect on CDIAA of a probiotic added to existing C. difficile infection (CDI) standard preventative measures (SPM) in 31,832 hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. Phase I (1580) measured the impact of SPM alone. In Phase II, 50 to 60 x 10(9) cfu daily dose of oral Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and L. casei LBC80R probiotic formula (Bio-K+) was administered to all patients receiving antibiotics. Phase III included the same intervention after a move to a new hospital facility. Phases II and III included 4968 patients. During Phase IV, 25,284 patients were submitted to the same regimen but outcome data were compared to those of similar hospitals in Quebec. RESULTS: At the end of Phase III, CDIAA had decreased from more than 18 cases per 1000 patient admissions in Phase I to less than 5 cases. Reductions of CDI cases (73%) (p < 0.001) and severe CDI cases (76.4%) (p < 0.001) were observed. CDI recurrence rate was reduced by 39% (p < 0.001). During the following 6 years, the CDI rate averaged 2.71 cases per 10,000 patient-days at PLGH compared to 8.50 cases per 10,000 patient-days in equivalent hospitals located in Quebec. STUDY LIMITATION: This study is not a randomized clinical trial; it is an open prospective study and should be treated as such. Also, following Phase II, PLGH moved into a new facility and this could have contributed to lower CDI. CONCLUSIONS: Specific probiotic product added to SPM and antibiotic stewardship activities resulted in a further reduction in CDI rates and was shown to be safe.
TI  - Inhibition of Cronobacter sakazakii by heat labile bacteriocins produced by probiotic LAB isolated from healthy infants.
AB  - Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia, meningitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, most often in neonates with case-fatality rates that may reach 80%. The antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against a wide range of foodborne pathogens is well-established in different types of food products. The objective of the current study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei isolated from feces of healthy infants against different strains of C. sakazakii in agar and a rehydrated infant milk formula (RIMF) model. The inhibition zones of C. sakazakii around L. acidophilus or L. casei ranged from 22 to 32 mm on eMan Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) agar under aerobic conditions, while a slight reduction in antibacterial activity was noted on modified MRS (0.2% glucose) under anaerobic conditions. It was observed that pH-neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS) of L. acidophilus or L. casei was inhibitory against tested C. sakazakii strains. The inhibition zones of neutralized CFS were lower than the antibacterial activities of live cultures. The antibacterial activity of CFS was abolished when CFS from L. acidophilus or L. casei was heated at 60 or 80 degrees C for either 10 min or 2 h, or treated with trypsin or pepsin. This was considered strong evidence that the inhibition was due to the production of bacteriocins by L. casei and L. acidophilus. Both the CFS and active growing cells of L. casei and L. acidophilus were able to reduce the viability of C. sakazakii in the RIMF model. The results may extend the use of natural antimicrobials instead of conventional preservation methods to improve the safety of RIMF.
TI  - Effects of 2 bracket and ligation types on plaque retention: a quantitative microbiologic analysis with real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of self-ligating  brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures on dental plaque retention and microbial flora. METHODS: Twenty boys (mean age, 14.2 +/- 1.5 years) underwent bonding with self-ligating bracket systems and conventional standard edgewise bracket systems ligated with stainless steel ligatures with a split-mouth design. Clinical measurements, including plaque index, probing pocket depth, and bleeding on probing, were obtained before bonding, 1 week after bonding, and 3 months after bonding. Supragingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline and 3 months after bonding for the detection of bacteria. A quantitative analysis for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Hotelling T(2) multivariate test were used for statistical comparisons of the groups. RESULTS: The numbers of S mutans, S sobrinus, L casei, and L acidophilus were not statistically different between self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures (P >0.05). The 2 archwire ligation techniques showed no statistically significant differences in plaque index, bleeding on probing, and probing pocket depth values of the bonded teeth (P >0.05). All clinical parameters and the numbers of all microorganisms showed statistically significant increases from baseline to 3 months after bonding in both groups (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures do not differ with regard to dental plaque retention.
TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. The multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) CFU), L. casei (7 x 10(9) CFU), L. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), L. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) CFU), Bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) CFU), B. longum (7 x 10(9) CFU), Streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (GSH). RESULTS: Between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in FPG (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). Although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. We observed a significant increase in HOMA-IR (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). Mean changes in serum hs-CRP were significantly different between the two groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group, p = 0.02). Probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma GSH levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in FPG and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-CRP and an increase in plasma total GSH.
TI  - The effect of Lacto- and Bifidobacteria in monoculture on the vaginal microflora  in norm and in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The influence of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMV B-7281 and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB, each strain separately, to the range of the urogenital tract microflora in physiological norm and in cases of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice induced by Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4. It was found that all these strains had different efficiency in Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 growth suppression in the vagina of infected mice and affect the spectrum of microorganisms. Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280 strain had effective antistaphylococcal effect and reduced the number of coliform bacteria and fungi in the vagina in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice. Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280 strain is promising to create probiotic drugs effective in treating intravaginal staphylococcosis.
TI  - Daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt decreases energy intake but does not improve gastrointestinal transit time: a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in healthy adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Probiotic and synbiotic products are widely marketed to healthy individuals, although potential benefits for these individuals are rarely studied. This study investigated the effect of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt on gastrointestinal (GI) function in a sample of healthy adults. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a randomized crossover double-blind study, 65 healthy adults consumed 200 g/day of yogurt with (synbiotic) or without (control) added probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus casei CRL431) and 4 g inulin for two 15-day treatment periods, each preceded by a 6-week washout period. GI transit time (GTT), duration of colour (DOC), GI symptoms and dietary intake were assessed and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, including PRE-treatment GTT as a covariate. Participants were grouped as short GTT (STT, n = 50, </=32.7 h) or long GTT (LTT, n = 15, >32.7 h) based on their PRE-treatment GTT assessment. RESULTS: POST-treatment GTT and DOC were not different between synbiotic and control, and did not change from PRE-treatment, within the STT or LTT groups. There were no changes in GI symptom ratings, indicating that both yogurts were well tolerated. In STT, energy, fat and protein intakes were decreased from baseline with synbiotic (p = 0.055, p = 0.059 and p = 0.005, respectively) and dietary fibre intake was higher POST-treatment with synbiotic versus control (p = 0.0002). In LTT, decreases in energy and fat intakes with synbiotic were not significant (p = 0.14 and p = 0.18, respectively) and there were no differences in dietary fibre intake. CONCLUSION: Consuming 200 g/day of synbiotic yogurt did not significantly alter GTT in healthy adults, but was well tolerated and helped to reduce overall energy intake.
TI  - Effect of Aloe vera juice on growth and activities of Lactobacilli in-vitro.
AB  - In present investigation, different concentrations of Aloe vera juice incorporated into the growth media of Lactobacilli were tested to observe the effect on growth and activities of these bacteria. From the results obtained, it was observed that aloe vera juice at a concentration of 5% v/v was effective in promoting the growth of L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. casei, as evident from the fall in pH and increased acidity, as well as from the improved generation time. At 15 to 25% concentration, growth was unaffected as compared to the controls; however, concentration higher than 25%v/v discouraged the growth. Overall, it was concluded that Aloe vera juice or gel at a particular concentration could possibly be used in combination with probiotic Lactobacillus strain(s) as a combinational therapy for gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular diseases.
TI  - The applications of polysaccharides from various mushroom wastes as prebiotics in different systems.
AB  - The bases or stipes of mushrooms are normally discarded as low-economic value animal feed and compost. There are no known reports on deriving polysaccharides from these mushroom wastes for use as prebiotics. This study showed that the relatively low concentration (0.1% to 0.5%) of polysaccharides from Lentinula edodes stipe, Pleurotus eryngii base, and Flammulina velutipes base can enhance the survival rate of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum during cold storage. The polysaccharides had synergistic effects with the peptides and amino acids from a yogurt culture to maintain probiotics above 10(7) CFU/mL during cold storage, and they also had significant protective effects on these probiotics in simulated gastric and bile juice conditions to achieve beneficial effects in the host. These results showed that mushroom wastes, which are cheaper than other sources, could be an important, new, alternative source of prebiotics.
TI  - Efficacy of polymer coating of probiotic beads suspended in pressurized and pasteurized longan juices on the exposure to simulated gastrointestinal environment.
AB  - Alginate-coated Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 or Lactobacillus casei 01 was recoated with either 0.1-0.5% (w/v) alginate or 0.05-0.15% (w/v) poly-L-lysine (PLL) plus 0.2% (w/v) alginate or 5-15% (w/v) gelatin, after which they were determined for survivability in gastric or bile longan juices. The morphology of encapsulated probiotic cells illustrated that recoated beads with 0.5% alginate showed a more compact surface and a greater protective effect than other recoating materials. The recoated beads with 0.5% alginate and 0.05-0.15% PLL plus 0.2% alginate of both strains showed the highest viability in gastric longan juice. In bile longan juice, only 0.5% alginate showed the best protection for both recoated beads. When considering the storage stability, encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5 exhibited a higher viable count than those of the free cells, whereas L. casei 01 showed equivalent viability of both free and double-coated cells. Based on the impact of pressurization or pasteurization, both processed juices gave rise to equivalent survivability of the probiotic cells during storage.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate Mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus jensenii, L. iners, L. crispatus and L. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. However, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. The present study was performed to genetically determine the identity of Lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) intermediate Mexican women. METHODS: In a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant Mexican women. The samples were classified into groups according to the Nugent score criteria proposed for detection of BV: normal (N), intermediate (I) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). We examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. RESULTS: Clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene: L. acidophilus (14/25), L. reuteri (6/25), L. casei (4/25) and L. buchneri (1/25). The remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as Enterococcus species. Within the L. acidophilus group, L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by L. jensenii and L. crispatus. L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the L. reuteri, L. casei and L. buchneri groups, respectively. ERIC profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the L. gasseri and L. fermentum species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with previous studies showing that L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. Additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant Mexican (Hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Distribution dynamics of recombinant Lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract  of neonatal rats.
AB  - One approach to deliver therapeutic agents, especially proteins, to the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is to use commensal bacteria as a carrier. Genus Lactobacillus is an attractive candidate for use in this approach. However, a system for expressing exogenous proteins at a high level has been lacking in Lactobacillus. Moreover, it will be necessary to introduce the recombinant Lactobacillus into the GI tract, ideally by oral administration. Whether orally administered Lactobacillus can reach and reside in the GI tract has not been explored in neonates. In this study, we have examined these issues in neonatal rats. To achieve a high level of protein expression in Lactobacillus, we tested the impact of three promoters and two backbones on protein expression levels using mRFP1, a red fluorescent protein, as a reporter. We found that a combination of an L-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhL) promoter of Lactobacillus sakei with a backbone from pLEM415 yielded the highest level of reporter expression. When this construct was used to transform Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus acidophilus, high levels of mRFP1 were detected in all these species and colonies of transformed Lactobacillus appeared pink under visible light. To test whether orally administered Lactobacillus can be retained in the GI tract of neonates, we fed the recombinant Lactobacillus casei to neonatal rats. We found that about 3% of the bacteria were retained in the GI tract of the rats at 24 h after oral feeding with more recombinant Lactobacillus in the stomach and small intestine than in the cecum and colon. No mortality was observed throughout this study with Lactobacillus. In contrast, all neonatal rats died within 24 hours after fed with transformed E. coli. Taken together, our results indicate that Lactobacillus has the potential to be used as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to neonates.
TI  - Use of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei for a potential probiotic legume-based fermented product using pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) as an appropriate substrate in the production of a legume-based fermented product with Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314 or Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 and then to ascertain the effects of the addition of ingredients such as powdered milk and banana or strawberry sauce. The products were analyzed for viable cell counts, pH, and sensory attributes during product manufacture and throughout the refrigerated storage period at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Nine types of products were produced. At the end of the storage period, the viability of L. acidophilus was above 7 log CFU/g in the presence of milk and 20% sucrose fruit sauce. For products with L. casei, the lack of ingredients such as milk caused no significant loss in viability; however, a high concentration of sucrose in the fruit sauce was an important factor in maintaining a high L. casei population. L. casei had high viability and good sensory attributes. Both strains could be considered suitable for a pigeon pea-based fermented potential probiotic product and a low-cost protein source.
TI  - Activities of free and encapsulated Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 or Lactobacillus casei 01 in processed longan juices on exposure to simulated gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit drinks containing probiotics are gaining interest in the global marketplace. For example, longan juice, containing carbohydrate and various bioactive components, is a potentially health-promoting beverage as well as probiotic carrier for human consumption. In this study, high-pressure and thermal processes were applied to eliminate competitive micro-organisms in longan juice prior to the addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 or Lactobacillus casei 01. The activities of these probiotics in a simulated gastrointestinal tract were also investigated. RESULTS: Encapsulated probiotics could survive in the acidic environment of the stomach and small intestine, while the free cells were completely eliminated. In the colon experiment, the influence of encapsulated L. casei 01 on colon lactobacilli was significantly greater than that of encapsulated L. acidophilus LA5. Both encapsulated probiotics suspended in processed longan juices led to extensive increases in the formation of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Acetate was the major SCFA produced by colon bacteria, followed by propionate and butyrate. The discernible clear zone suggested that L. casei 01 provided greater antibacterial activity than L. acidophilus LA5. CONCLUSION: Both encapsulated probiotics along with processed longan juice led to significant increases in colon lactobacilli, lactic acid and SCFA formation.
TI  - Bioactivity of probiotic whey cheese: characterization of the content of peptides and organic acids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic whey cheeses have been produced for several years. It is recognized that several bacterium-mediated metabolic activities contribute differently to the final sensory and nutritional profiles of dairy products. Hence the metabolic activity of probiotic strains in a whey cheese and their contribution to the bioactivity of such matrices were investigated here, including in particular Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei. RESULTS: Both L. casei and B. animalis produce lactic and acetic acids, whereas L. acidophilus produce mainly lactic acid; these metabolites may be considered bioprotection factors. Water-soluble extracts (WSE) obtained from these cheese matrices were subjected to ultrafiltration through a 3 kDa cut-off membrane, and the eluted peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. Different qualitative and quantitative profiles were obtained, depending on the strain. WSE were further assayed for their ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme; the <3 kDa fraction exhibited higher activities in the case of L. casei and B. animalis than the control and L. acidophilus. CONCLUSION: Whey cheeses with higher nutritional value were those inoculated with L. casei.
TI  - Probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses DMH-induced procarcinogenic fecal enzymes and preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in early colon carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats.
AB  - Diet makes an important contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk implying risks for CRC are potentially reducible. Therefore, the probiotics have been suggested as the prophylactic measure in colon cancer. In this study, different probiotics were used to compare their protective potential against 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH)-induced chemical colon carcinogenesis in Sprague Dawley rats. Animals belonging to different probiotic groups were fed orally with 1 x 10(9) lactobacilli daily for 1 week, and then a weekly injection of DMH was given intraperitoneally for 6 wks with daily administration of probiotic. Lactobacillus GG and L.acidophilus + DMH-treated animals had maximum percent reduction in ACF counts. A significant decrease (P < 0.05) in fecal nitroreductase activity was observed in L.casei + DMH and L.plantarum + DMH-treated rats whereas beta-glucuronidase activity decreased in L.GG + DMH and L.acidophilus + DMH-treated rats. Animals treated with Bifidobacterium bifidum + DMH had significant decreased beta-glucosidase activity. However, not much difference was observed in the colon morphology of animals belonging to various probiotic + DMH-treated rats compared with DMH-treated alone. The results indicated that probiotics, L.GG, and L.acidophilus can be used as the better prophylactic agents for experimental colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - Probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. Probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus KACC 12419, Lact. casei KACC 12413, Lact. paracasei KACC 12427 and Lact. rhamnosus KACC 11953) and pathogens (Salmonella Typhimurium KCCM 40253 and Listeria monocytogenes KACC 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. The highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in Lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), Lact. casei (17.2%) and Lact. acidophilus (15.1%). Salm. Typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. The numbers of L. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with Lact. paracasei and Lact. rhamnosus. The results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.
TI  - Effect of probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria on the activity of macrophages and other parameters of immunity in cases of staphylococcosis.
AB  - The immunomodulatory properties of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMVB-7281, Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animales VKL and B. animales VKB strains on the models of experimental staphylococcosis infection in mice were determined. It was found that after the mice, infected with staphylococcus, were treated by some probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, a normalization of functional activity of phagoctic cells system and increase of the endogenous interferon production were observed. L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus IMVB-7281, L. casei IMVB-7280, L. acidophilus IMV B-7279, B. animales VKB and B. animales VKL are promising for the development of probiotics, effective against staphylococci and for the immunity correction.
TI  - The effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria compositions on the vaginal microflora in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The effect of intravaginal injection of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB strains in various compositions on the range of microflora of the urogenital tract on the model of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was established that under the influence of various compositions of these strains changes in microflora spectrum occurred the number of representatives of normoflora increased and the number of pathogenic microorganisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria and fungi, significantly decreased. It was determined that strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, that were studied, are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis.
TI  - Differences in TLR9-dependent inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha system activation by genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic DNA  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live LAB dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic DNA level. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species-Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri-using Caco-2 cells. To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation were examined. All LAB genomic DNAs dose-dependently decreased H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation. Comparison of these effects between Lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of L. acidophilus genomic DNA are lower than those of the other species. Furthermore, suppression of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a specific receptor of bacterial DNA, expression by RNAi abolished the decrease of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation by LAB genomic DNA. Our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic DNA differ between Lactobacillus species and TLR9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LAB genomic DNA.
TI  - Effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. Mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. Results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. The symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering LDL-C, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and LDL-C than the phytosterol-containing treatment. The phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. In conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of Lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.
TI  - Comparative study of the protective capacity against Salmonella infection between probiotic and nonprobiotic Lactobacilli.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the immunoprotective ability of three Lactobacilli strains against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in a mouse model. To identify the probiotic properties involved in the protection against infection caused by this pathogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The immunomodulatory effect of three different lactobacilli strains: Lactobacillus (Lact.) casei CRL 431 (probiotic bacterium), Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 423 (Lact. bulgaricus) and Lact.acidophilus CRL 730 was compared using a mouse model of Salmonella infection. Lactobacillus casei continuous administration improved animal survival, diminished pathogen spreading outside the intestine, attenuated the intestinal inflammation, modulated cytokine profile previous and postinfection and increased the expression and secretion of IgA in the gut. Additionally, the administration of this lactobacilli increased peritoneal, Peyer's patches and spleen macrophages' phagocytic activity in healthy mice and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) released by intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro assay. Although Lact. acidophilus increased the number of IgA-secreting cells previous and postinfection, and Lact. bulgaricus increased MCP-1 released by intestinal epithelial cells and the phagocytic activity of macrophages, these effects alone were not enough to confer protection against Salmonella Typhimurium infection in mouse. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic strain Lact. casei CRL 431 was the one that induced protection against Salmonella, by increasing the intestinal barrier function and by decreasing the local inflammatory response. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Salmonella spp. constitutes an important agent of foodborne diseases in the world. Not all lactobacilli, even with some immunostimulating properties at gut level, can protect against Salmonella infection. Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, a probiotic bacterium, could be useful as an oral mucosal adjuvant of the immune system to improve gut health, especially in the prevention or amelioration of Salmonella infections. We demonstrated that there is not a unique mechanism by which this protective effect was exerted.
TI  - The effect of lacto- and bifidobacteria compositions on the vaginal microflora in cases of intravaginal staphylococcosis.
AB  - The effect of intravaginal injection of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lactobacillus acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium animalis VKL and Bifidobacterium animalis VKB strains in various compositions on the range of microflora of the urogenital tract on the model of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was established that under the influence of various compositions of these strains changes in microflora spectrum occurred: the number of representatives of normoflora increased and the number of pathogenic microorganisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria and fungi, significantly decreased. It was determined that strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria, that were studied, are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus casei group based on the profiling of ribosomal proteins coded in S10-spc-alpha operons as observed by MALDI-TOF MS.
AB  - The taxonomy of the members of the Lactobacillus casei group is complicated because of their phylogenetic similarity and controversial nomenclatural status. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of ribosomal proteins coded in the S10-spc-alpha operon, termed S10-GERMS, was applied in order to classify 33 sample strains belonging to the L. casei group. A total of 14 types of ribosomal protein genes coded in the operon were first sequenced from four type strains of the L. casei group (L. casei JCM 1134(T), L. paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 8130(T), L. paracasei subsp. tolerans JCM 1171(T), and L. rhamnosus JCM 1136(T)) together with L. casei JCM 11302, which is the former type strain of 'L. zeae'. The theoretical masses of the 14 types of ribosomal proteins used as biomarkers were classified into five types and compiled into a ribosomal protein database. The observed ribosomal proteins of each strain, identified by MALDI-TOF MS, were categorized into types based on their masses, summarized as ribosomal protein profiles, and they were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The 33 sample strains, together with seven genome-sequenced strains, could be classified into four major clusters, which coincided precisely with the taxa of the (sub)species within the L. casei group. Three "ancient" strains, identified as L. acidophilus and L. casei, were correctly re-identified as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei by S10-GERMS. S10-GERMS would thus appear to be a powerful tool for phylogenetic characterization, with considerable potential for management of culture collections.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on proteinase activities of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant at different pH levels and salt concentrations: Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of substitution of NaCl with  KCl at different pH levels and salt concentrations on proteinase activity of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant of the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei. de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth aliquots were mixed with 2 pure salts (NaCl and KCl) and 2 salt concentrations at 2 concentration levels (5 and 10%), inoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus casei, and incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 22 h. The cultures were then centrifuged at 4,000xg for 30 min, and the collected cell pellets were used to prepare cell-wall proteinases and the supernatants used as a source of supernatant (extracellular) proteinases. The proteolytic activity and protein content of both portions were determined. After incubation of both portions with 3 milk caseins (alpha-, beta-, kappa-casein), the supernatants were individually subjected to analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity and proteolytic activity using the o-phthalaldehyde method. Significant differences were observed in ACE-inhibitory and proteolytic activities between salt substitution treatments of cell-free extract and cell-free supernatant from both probiotic strains at the same salt concentration and pH level.
TI  - Bugs that debugs: Probiotics.
AB  - The oral cavity harbors a diverse array of bacterial species. There are more than 600 species that colonize in the oral cavity. These include a lot of organisms that are not commonly known to reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and also are more familiar: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The balance of all these microorganisms can easily be disturbed and a prevalence of pathogenic organisms can lead to various oral health problems including dental caries, periodontitis, and halitosis.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus regulate inflammatory pathway and improve antioxidant status in collagen-induced arthritic rats.
AB  - In view of well-established immunomodulatory properties of Lactobacillus, present investigation was carried out to evaluate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus, against inflammatory pathway and oxidative stress developed in an experimental model of arthritis. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was used. Oral administration of L. casei, L. acidophilus, standard antiarthritic drug indomethacin, and vehicle were started after induced arthritis and continued up to day 28. Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were estimated in serum. In parallel, oxidative stress parameters were also measured from synovial effsuate. All rats were graded for arthritis score at the end of each week. L. casei, L. acidophilus, and indomethacin treatment significantly downregulated proinflammatory and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines at P<0.0001. They have significantly decreased oxidative stress in synovial effsuate (P<0.0001) and also arthritis score (P<0.05). Protection provided by L. casei and L. acidophilus was more pronounced than that of indomethacin. These lines of evidence suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus exert potent protective effect against CIA. It further establishes effective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of Lactobacillus. However, additional clinical investigations are needed to prove the efficacy of Lactobacillus in treatment/management of rheumatoid arthritis.
TI  - Fermentation of sugars and sugar alcohols by plaque Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to analyse the ability of Lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary Sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. Growth and pH were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. RESULTS: No differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. All strains lowered the pH to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. A pH of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. The ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among Lactobacillus fermentum strains. CONCLUSION: A large number of Lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to pH levels critical for enamel demineralisation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on Akawi cheese: chemical composition, proteolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity, probiotic survival, texture profile, and sensory properties.
AB  - The effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on Akawi cheese with probiotic bacteria was investigated during 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Chemical composition, the survival of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria, proteolytic activity, and texture profile analysis were analyzed and sensory analysis was carried out to determine the effects of substitution. No significant differences were observed in moisture, protein, fat, and ash contents among the experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period. Significant differences were observed in water-soluble nitrogen and phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen between experimental cheeses at the same of storage period. No significant difference was observed in the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus between experimental cheeses at the same storage period. However, the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was significantly affected among experimental cheeses. A significant difference was observed in soluble Ca among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. In general, no significant differences existed in hardness and adhesiveness among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. No significant differences existed in sensory attributes, including creaminess, bitterness, saltiness, sour-acid, and vinegar taste among experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period.
TI  - Effect of flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli to intestinal cells.
AB  - The effect of dietary flavan-3-ols on the adhesion of potential probiotic lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells was unraveled. The inhibitory activity of these compounds on intestinal cells was highlighted. The cytotoxic effect was shown to depend on both the compound's chemical structure (galloylation and polymerization) and degree of differentiation of intestinal cells. The effect of flavan-3-ols on bacteria adhesion differed greatly between compounds, strains, and intestinal cells. All flavan-3-ols inhibited significantly Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL379 adhesion except epigallocatechin gallate, which enhanced L. acidophilus LA-5 adhesion to Caco-2. Procyanidins B1 and B2 increased remarkably the adhesion of Lactobacillus casei LC115 to HT-29 cells, whereas epigallocatechin increased L. casei LC115 adhesion to Caco-2. These data showed the potential of flavan-3-ols to alter gut microecology by modifying adhesion of lactobacilli strains to intestinal cells.
TI  - Is primary prevention of Clostridium difficile infection possible with specific probiotics?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is highly controversial, particularly with regard to the prevention of recurrent CDI. We hypothesize that primary prevention of CDI among patients receiving antibiotics might be a more achievable goal for probiotics than prevention in patients with previous CDI where the host flora is markedly altered. METHODS: We conducted a literature search for randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies of probiotic use among adults receiving antibiotics, in which CDI was one of the outcomes measured. In addition, we conducted meta-analyses of probiotics that were included in more than one randomized trial. RESULTS: Eleven studies were identified; most were seriously underpowered to determine the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of CDI. Two showed significantly lower rates of CDI among the probiotic recipients. A meta-analysis of three studies that used the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R and a combined analysis of those studies with four studies that used Saccharomyces boulardii, showed lower CDI rates in recipients of probiotics compared with recipients of placebo (risk ratio=0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: While potential flaws in study design were identified, a review of the available literature suggests that the primary prevention of CDI with specific probiotic agents may be achievable. Additional studies of sufficient size and with rigorous design are needed to confirm these findings.
TI  - Effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. Eight probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus brevis KACC 10553, Lactobacillus casei KACC 12413, Lactobacillus paracasei ATCC 25598, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Leuconostoc mesenteroides KACC 12312, and Pediococcus acidilactici KACC 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. The ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. L. acidophilus, L. brevis, and P. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. P. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mM to the detection limits, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. The study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.
TI  - Lactobacillus protected bone damage and maintained the antioxidant status of liver and kidney homogenates in female wistar rats.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate protective property of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus in minimizing oxidative stress associated with arthritis from liver and kidney. Subsequently, protective property of Lactobacillus against the bone damage was also taken into consideration. Arthritis was induced by injecting freund's complete adjuvant (100 mul) into sub plantar surface of hind paw. Oral administration of culture, vehicle, and drug started after induction of arthritis (i.e. on day 9th). Indomethacin was used as a standard drug. Radiographic analysis of the hind paw knee joint was also done at the end of the 21st day. Oxidative stress parameters were studied from liver and kidney homogenate. Histopathology of liver and kidney was also performed. Lactobacillus treatment significantly rescued the enzymatic level of catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase in both liver and kidney homogenates, whereas it has decreased the malonaldehyde accumulation. Oral administration of Lactobacillus also significantly decreased the serum ceruloplasmin level. Radiographic analysis also corroborated these findings. Lactobacillus treatment maintained the normal histopathology of liver and kidney. Results of this study clearly suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus, alone or in combination, decreased the bone damaged and effectively restored antioxidant status of liver and kidney. Lactobacillus has a significant antiarthritic and antioxidant activity against freund's complete adjuvant induced arthritis in rats.
TI  - Antagonistic Action of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in Relation to Staphylococcus aureus and Their Influence on the Immune Response in Cases of Intravaginal Staphylococcosis in Mice.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, Bifidobacterium longum VK1, and B. bifidum VK2 strains or their various compositions in relation to Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and on models of experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis of mice was determined. It was found that under the influence of these strains and their various compositions, the in vitro growth of Staph. aureus was inhibited, and the number of colonies of Staph. aureus plated from the vagina of infected mice was significantly reduced. The antibacterial activity of these strains separately and in compositions correlated with their ability to improve the performance of the immune response. These strains were the most effective in the following compositions: Lact. casei IMV B-7280-B. longum VK1-B. bifidum VK2. Strains of Lact. casei IMV B-7280, Lact. acidophilus IMV B-7279, B. bifidum VK2, and B. longum VK1 are prospective components of future probiotic drugs efficient in treating staphylococcosis and for immunity correction.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on Candida species implicated in Candida vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research from developing countries, such as Nigeria, on Lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. The in vitro inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated Candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. RESULTS: The maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal Lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/L, 1.36 mmol/L, and 1.72 mg/L respectively. From the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/L; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/L; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/L. The maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. The in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. delbrueckii, and L. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 Candida species tested, while vaginal L. acidophilus and L. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of Candida species in vitro. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis, a chronic recurrent disease, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. In the last 30 years, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis has rapidly increased due to industrialization. Therefore, there have been attempts in recent years to find new ways of treating and preventing atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus salivarius strains were evaluated in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. METHODS: Forty pediatric patients (23 males and 17 females) aged 1~13 years were enrolled. One eligible individual who was approached declined to participate. The probiotic group was administered a probiotic complex containing B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. salivarius for 8 weeks. The placebo group, on the other hand, was administered skim milk powder and dextrose. All of the parameters including serum cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) were measured in both the probiotic group and the placebo group at the end of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic intervention in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients effectively reduced the SCORAD index and serum cytokines interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and total serum IgE levels, but did not reduce levels of serum cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, ECP, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Our study found probiotics to be effective in reducing atopic dermatitis patients' SCORAD index, serum IL-5, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and total serum IgE levels but not effective in reducing serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, ECP, or TNF-alpha levels.
TI  - Gut Balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal Lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  - Synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. A double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of Gut Balance, which contains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (L. casei 431(R)), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (BB-12(R)), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5(R)), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG(R)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. All subjects randomized were included in the analysis. There was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal L. paracasei numbers with Gut Balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. Gut Balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum IL-16 in comparison to acacia gum from pre- to post-study. No substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal SCFA concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or GI permeability. Clinical studies are now required to determine whether Gut Balance may exert beneficial GI health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal L. paracasei. Both supplements had little effect on immunity. Twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. Saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. Participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.
TI  - Diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  - The high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. Fermentations were performed at 37 degrees C for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. Cultivable populations, pH, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. Hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. Forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 Deltalog CFU/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 Deltalog CFU/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. Regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. Whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. Special attention was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656. The strain variability observed and the PCA applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in pH) of whey.
TI  - Double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in newborns weighing <1500 g. METHODS: We studied a group of 150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacteruim infantis, Streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of January 2007 through June 2010. Clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. RESULTS: The primary outcome was the development of NEC. Both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. Blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or Bifidobacteria growth. No differences were detected in terms of NEC risk reduction (RR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.39) although we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of NEC frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. When the combined risk of NEC or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of NEC in preterm newborns.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of lactobacillus on carrageenan-induced paw edema in male wistar rats.
AB  - Introduction. Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were used to assess the anti-inflammatory properties in carrageenan induced acute inflammatory model. Materials and Methods. Diclofenac sodium was used as standard drug at concentration of 150 mg/kg of body weight. Culture of Lactobacillus 2 x 10(7) CFU/ml was given orally. Edema was induced with 1% carrageenan to all the groups after one hour of the oral treatments. Paw thickness was checked at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 24 hours. Stair climbing score and motility score were assessed at t = 24 hours. Cytokines assay for IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha was performed on serum samples. Results. Lactobacillus showed a statistically significant decrease in paw thickness at P < 0.001. L. acidophilus and L. casei decreased by 32% and 28% in paw thickness. They both significantly increased the stair climbing and motility score. Lactobacillus treatment significantly downregulated IL-6 and TNF-alpha while upregulated IL-10 at P < 0.0001. Conclusion. L. casei and L. acidophilus significantly decreased the inflammatory reactions induced by carrageenan. This study has also proposed that Lactobacillus ameliorated the inflammatory reaction by downregulating the proinflammatory cytokines pathway.
TI  - Probiotic modulation of dendritic cells co-cultured with intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - AIM: To investigate cytokine production and cell surface phenotypes of dendritic  cells (DC) in the presence of epithelial cells stimulated by probiotics. METHODS: Mouse DC were cultured alone or together with mouse epithelial cell monolayers in normal or inverted systems and were stimulated with heat-killed probiotic bacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis AD011 (BL), Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 (BB), Lactobacillus casei IBS041 (LC), and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 (LA), for 12 h. Cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and phenotypic analysis of DC was investigated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: BB and LC in single-cultured DC increased the expression of I-Ad, CD86 and CD40 (I-Ad, 18.51 vs 30.88, 46.11; CD86, 62.74 vs 92.7, 104.12; CD40, 0.67 vs 6.39, 3.37, P < 0.05). All of the experimental probiotics increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. However, in the normal co-culture systems, LC and LA decreased the expression of I-A(d) (39.46 vs 30.32, 33.26, P < 0.05), and none of the experimental probiotics increased the levels of IL-6 or TNF-alpha. In the inverted co-culture systems, LC decreased the expression of CD40 (1.36 vs -2.27, P < 0.05), and all of the experimental probiotics decreased the levels of IL-6. In addition, BL increased the production of IL-10 (103.8 vs 166.0, P < 0.05) and LC and LA increased transforming growth factor-beta secretion (235.9 vs 618.9, 607.6, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that specific probiotic strains exert differential immune modulation mediated by the interaction of dendritic cells and epithelial cells in the homeostasis of gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - The effect of using prebiotic and probiotic products on intestinal micro-flora of the honeybee (Apis mellifera carpatica).
AB  - Maintaining bee colonies in a healthy state throughout the year is one of the main concerns of apiculture researchers. The phenomenon of disappearance of bee colonies is determined by several factors, one of which is bee disease. Due to the organizational structure of the bee colony, disease transmission is rapid, especially through infected food or via the nurse worker bees that feed the brood bees of the colony concerned. The practice of stimulating the bee colonies in spring using sugar syrup feeds with added prebiotic products (lactic acid or acetic acid) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14 and Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04) by using an Enterobiotic product (Lactobacillus casei), marketed as Enterolactis Plus, for three weeks, resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of bacteria in the digestive tracts of the bees, compared with the control group. By contrast, intestinal colonization with beneficial bacteria contained in probiotics products administered to the bees was observed. This resulted in an improved health status and bio productive index of the bee colonies studied.
TI  - Effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  - Probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with NaCl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. Cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. In some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. Assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (BGP) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. For most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of BGP supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. Growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. Addition of the BGP supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium did not enhance survival to air-drying. Furthermore, addition of BGP to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. This study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.
TI  - [Development of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and application for characterization and identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for molecular typing of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) and to apply it in identification and characterization of both bacteria isolated from yoghurt collected from Beijing supermarket. METHODS: The five most useful restriction enzymes including Apa I, Not I, Sfi I, Xba I and Sma I were chosen to cut DNA of 52 strains of Lactobacillus, S. thermophilus as well as associated standard bacteria strains. The endonucleases and electrophoresis conditions for PFGE analysis were optimized and applied in molecular typing of Lactobacillus and S.thermophilus isolates. Cluster analysis based on the PFGE data was conducted. The identification results of PFGE were compared with those obtained in biochemical and 16s ribosomal RNA PCR identification tests. RESULTS: Not I was suitable for L. bulgaricus, L. fermentum and L. delbrueckii digestion. While Apa I was an appropriate endonuclease for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. casei digestion. The results of molecular typing indicated that 24 strains of L.bulgaricus and 15 strains of S. thermophilus were grouped into 8 types by PFGE method, respectively. While 7 strains of L.acidophilus were grouped into 3 types and 2 strains of L. delbrueckii were grouped into 2 different PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The results of PFGE analysis are in compliance with those of 16s rRNA PCR and biochemical identification. The PFGE method developed in this study is suitable for molecular characterization of both Lactobacillus and S. thermophilus.
TI  - The effect of microbial-nutrient interaction on the immune system of young chicks after early probiotic and organic acid administration.
AB  - The combined effects of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and organic acids (sorbic and citric acid) on intestinal morphology and expression of immune-related genes were investigated. One-day-old chicks were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: birds not receiving probiotic or organic acids (control; T1), or birds receiving an oral combination (1 g/L in water) of 10(8) CFU/g of each of the aforementioned probiotics and organic acids (1% sorbic acid and 0.2% citric acid) for 7 (T2) or 14 d (T3). Each group was divided into 5 replicate pens of 20 birds each, and 5 birds from each group (1 from each pen) were killed on d 11 and 22. Intestinal sections were collected for histological assessment, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was used to assess defensin and cathelicidins expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess toll-like receptors (TLR) and cytokine expression. Duodenal villus height was greater in T2 and T3 at d 11 (P </= 0.036) and 22 (P </= 0.015) compared with T1. At d 11, duodenal goblet cell/unit area was less in T3, whereas it was greater in T2 compared with T1 in the jejunum (P = 0.009). Ileal goblet cell/unit area was greater in T3 at d 22 compared with T1 (P < 0.001). Avian beta-defensin-3 was expressed in all tissues except the bursa of T3 birds at d 11, and TLR-2 was down regulated in the cecal tonsil of birds in T2 and T3 at d 11 compared with T1 (P = 0.020 and 0.003, respectively). Expression of IL-12p35 in the ileum at d 11 was down regulated in T2 and T3 compared with T1 (P = 0.030 and 0.012, respectively). Reduced expression of INF-gamma was observed in the ileum in T3 compared with T1 at d 11 (P = 0.047). Ileal IL-6 and IL-10 and cecal tonsil interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) expressions were greater T2 at d 22 (P </= 0.047) than T1. In conclusion, supplementation of combined probiotics and organic acids resulted in inconsistent gut morphology associated responses, and avian beta-defensins and cathelicidins expression were not associated with combined probiotics and organic acids supplementation. Birds supplemented with combined probiotics and organic acids for 7 d showing similar responses in TLR-2, IL-12p35, and IFN-gamma compared with those supplemented for 14 d indicates that shorter periods of supplementation might be enough to elicit beneficial responses.
TI  - [The influence of lactic acid bacteria and yeast on production of staphylococcal  enterotoxins].
AB  - Research of influence of 10 lactic acid bacteria cultures on staphylococcal growth and production of staphylococcal enterotoxins SEA and SEB has shown that lactic acid bacteria slow down SEA in 5,7 fold and SEB - 1,56 fold. All investigated cultures possessed inhibition action on SEA and SEB production. Has been established, what lactic acid bacteria slow down growth of staphylococcus in 1,48 fold. It has shown that appears, that the most effective inhibitors of SEA and SEB production are strains L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus 317/402.
TI  - Comparison of fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides  species.
AB  - The utilization of 1-kestose (GF(2)) and nystose (GF(3)), the main components of  fructooligosaccharides (FOS), by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species was examined. Of seven Lactobacillus and five Bacteroides strains that utilized FOS, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, and L. gasseri utilized only GF(2), whereas L. acidophilus and all the Bacteroides strains utilized both GF(2) and GF(3). Only the strains able to utilize both GF(2) and GF(3) had beta-fructosidase activity in the culture supernatants. The culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus strains had higher beta-fructosidase activity for GF(2) than for GF(3), whereas those of the Bacteroides strains had higher activity for GF(3) than for GF(2). Furthermore, beta-fructosidase activity of the culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus cells grown in the GF(3) medium was much higher than that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium, whereas the activity of the culture supernatants of the Bacteroides cells grown in the GF(3) medium was almost the same as that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium. These results indicate that Lactobacillus species metabolize FOS in a different way from that of Bacteroides species.
TI  - Antibacterial and phytochemical studies on Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. latex  against selected cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial potential of the chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, methanol and aqueous extracts of Calotropis gigantia (L.) R. Br. was evaluated by using five cariogenic bacteria, Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus mutans. Agar well diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used for this purpose. The chloroform extracted fraction of latex showed inhibitory effect against S. mutans and L. acidophilus with MIC value of 0.032 and 0.52 mg/mL, respectively. Qualitative investigation on structure elucidation of bioactive compound using IR, NMR and GC-MS techniques revealed the presence of methyl nonanoate, a saturated fatty acid.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of an Amazon medicinal plant (Chancapiedra) (Phyllanthus niruri L.) against Helicobacter pylori and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The potential of water extracts of the Amazon medicinal plant Chancapiedra (Phyllanthus niruri L.) from Ecuador and Peru for antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori and different strains of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. H. pylori was inhibited by both water extracts in a dose dependent manner, whereas lactic acid bacterial growth was not affected. Both extracts contained ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and exhibited high free radical scavenging linked-antioxidant activities (89%). However, gallic acid was detected only in the Ecuadorian extract. Preliminary studies on the mode of action of Chancapiedra against H. pylori revealed that inhibition may not involve proline dehydrogenase-based oxidative phosphorylation inhibition associated with simple mono-phenolics and could involve ellagitannins or other non-phenolic compounds through a yet unknown mechanism. This study provides evidence about the potential of Chancapiedra for H. pylori inhibition without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Savings from the use of a probiotic formula in the prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and particularly Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are the most common causes of healthcare associated infectious diarrhea. A double-blind, dose response, placebo-controlled trial of the probiotic formula (Bio-K+ Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R formula) for prophylaxis of AAD and CDAD was published in 2010. The Bio-K+ Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R formula is a registered trademark of Bio-K Plus International Inc. (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Results indicated that the incidence of AAD and CDAD were lower for patients assigned to the probiotic formula compared with the placebo option. The present study aims to estimate the savings in direct medical costs that might result from the use of two different doses of the probiotic formula vs placebo. METHODS: A cost-consequence analysis was conducted to compare the two doses of the probiotic formula compared to placebo. The analysis was based upon published data and adjusted to the North American context. RESULTS: Economic analyses showed that the use of the probiotic formula would result in estimated mean per patients savings of US$1968 for the single dose and US$2661 for the double dose compared with the placebo option if used an average of 13 days by all patients at risk of developing AAD and CDAD. LIMITATIONS: Several key parameters considered within the economic model were not captured within the Gao et al. study. Numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted to address this issue. CONCLUSION: The use of the probiotic formula in prophylaxis of AAD and CDAD would lead to estimated savings in direct medical costs that would substantially offset its acquisition cost. Treating 1000 hospitalized patients on antibiotics with the double dose of the product compared to current practice would save a single payer system the sum of $2,661,218.
TI  - Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. Diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. This review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. Rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (not GG), and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. In the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of India, again with modest efficacy. Previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. More recently, a large trial in Poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for Lactobacillus GG. The prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both in children and in adults. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium ssp, Streptococcus ssp, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. As for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. The vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. Such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day. The effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.
TI  - Utilization of UF-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus casei and Lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in MRS broth and three lactococci strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in M17 broth. L. reuteri and S. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 U/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. The maximum production of beta-galactosidase by L. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial pH 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g N/L and incubation temperature at 30 degrees C/24 hrs to give 6.31 U/ml. While in case of S. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (KH2PO4:K2HPO4, g/L), at initial pH 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate (0.66g N/L) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees C for 24 hrs to give 7.85 U/ml.
TI  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  - The health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. Here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Most lactobacilli strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong IL-12 and TNF-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. In contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low IL-12 and TNF-alpha inducers. IL-10 and IL-6 levels showed less variation and no correlation with IL-12 and TNF-alpha. DC matured by strong IL-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (IFN)-beta. When combining two strains, low IL-12 inducers inhibited this IFN-beta production as well as IL-12 and Th1-skewing chemokines. The IFN-beta induction was mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) irrespective of the stimulating strain. The inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-Jun dimerization protein (JDP)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of JNK. Our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects. This underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.
TI  - Macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - Spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. Since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. Resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Lactobacillus casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. Frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x MIC were evaluated in susceptible isolates. Acquired resistance was defined as an increment in MIC values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. Resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermB gene and A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. Frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin and erythromycin than for tetracycline. Serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. However, acquired resistance was rather unstable and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. Resistance to erythromycin was associated to a A2058G mutation in 23S rRNA. In conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. Decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. Since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.
TI  - Survival of probiotic lactobacilli in the upper gastrointestinal tract using an in vitro gastric model of digestion.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate survival of three commercial probiotic strains (Lactobacillus casei subsp. shirota, L. casei subsp. immunitas, Lactobacillus acidophilus subsp. johnsonii) in the human upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract using a dynamic gastric model (DGM) of digestion followed by incubation under duodenal conditions. Water and milk were used as food matrices and survival was evaluated in both logarithmic and stationary phase. The % of recovery in logarithmic phase ranged from 1.0% to 43.8% in water for all tested strains, and from 80.5% to 197% in milk. Higher survival was observed in stationary phase for all strains. L. acidophilus subsp. johnsonii showed the highest survival rate in both water (93.9%) and milk (202.4%). Lactic acid production was higher in stationary phase, L. casei subsp. shirota producing the highest concentration (98.2 mM) after in vitro gastric plus duodenal digestion.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - Sequencing and analysis of three plasmids from Lactobacillus casei TISTR1341 and  development of plasmid-derived Escherichia coli-L. casei shuttle vectors.
AB  - Pyrosequencing followed by conventional PCR and sequencing was used to determine  the complete nucleotide sequence of three plasmids (pRCEID2.9, pRCEID3.2, and pRCEID13.9) from the Lactobacillus casei strain TISTR1341. The plasmid sequences were found to be almost identical, respectively, to those of pLA106, pLA105, and pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus strain TK8912, suggesting that these strains may be related. Sequence analysis and comparison indicated that pRCEID2.9 replicates by a rolling circle (RC) mechanism, while pRCEID3.2 and pRCEID13.9 probably follow a theta-type mode of replication. Replicons of pRCEID2.9 and pRCEID13.9 were used to develop Escherichia coli/L. casei compatible shuttle vectors, which were stably maintained in different genetic backgrounds. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed copy numbers of around 4 and 15, respectively, for the pRCEID13.9- and pRCEID2.9-derived shuttle vectors per chromosome equivalent. The functionality of vector pRCEID-LC13.9 was proved by cloning and expressing in L. casei of a green fluorescent protein gene variant from Aequorea victoria under the control of the promoter from a homologous lactate dehydrogenase gene. The new vectors might complement those currently in use for the exploitation of L. casei as a cellular factory and in other biotechnological applications.
TI  - Selective and differential enumerations of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt--a review.
AB  - Yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. To meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. This requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium. This chapter presents an overview of media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar containing fructose (MRSF), MRS agar pH 5.2 (MRS 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at pH 5.0 (RCPB 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 (RCA 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees C for 72h. S. thermophilus (ST) agar and M17 are recommended for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus. Selective enumeration of Lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in Rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (X-Glu) or MRS containing maltose (MRSM) and incubation in a 20% CO2 atmosphere. Lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated Lb. casei (LC) agar from products containing yoghurt starter bacteria (S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Lb. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lb. casei. Bifidobacterium could be enumerated on MRS agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (MRS-NPNL) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72h.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG as an Effective Probiotic for Murine Giardiasis.
AB  - The gut microflora is an important constituent in the intestinal mucosal barrier  and has been introduced as the concept of probiotic therapy that beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to explore the protective potential of various lactobacilli strains for murine giardiasis. By experimentation, it was found that the probiotic supplementation of either Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, or L. rhamnosus GG, 7 days prior to inoculation with G. lamblia trophozoites, reduced the rate of cyst excretion compared with Giardia-infected mice. Interestingly, L. GG was found to be the most effective probiotic in reducing the duration of giardia cycle and acts as an effective prophylactic probiotic for murine giardiasis but needs to be clinically correlated due to entirely different human microflora.
TI  - Use of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation technique for in vivo detection of  cariogenic microorganisms on metallic brackets, with or without use of an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation (CDDH) assay, this randomised clinical study evaluated the contamination of metallic brackets by four cariogenic bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) mouthwashes in reducing bacterial contamination. METHODS: Thirty-nine 11-33-year-old patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances were enrolled in the study and had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to premolars. Nineteen patients used a 0.12% CHX mouthwash (Periogard) and 20 patients used a placebo mouthwash (control) twice a week. After 30 days, the brackets were removed and samples were obtained for analysis by CDDH. Data were analysed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=0.05) using the SAS software. RESULTS: S. mutans, S. sobrinus, L. casei and L. acidophilus were detected in 100% of the samples from both groups. However, brackets of the control group were more heavily contaminated by S. mutans and S. sobrinus (P<0.01). In the experimental group, although all counts decreased after rinsing with the chlorhexidine solution, there was significant difference only for S. mutans (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes can be useful in clinical practice to reduce the levels of cariogenic microorganisms in patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.
TI  - Survival of probiotic adjunct cultures in cheese and challenges in their enumeration using selective media.
AB  - Various selective media for enumerating probiotic and cheese cultures were screened, with 6 media then used to study survival of probiotic bacteria in full-fat and low-fat Cheddar cheese. Commercial strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, or Bifidobacterium lactis were added as probiotic adjuncts. The selective media, designed to promote growth of certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) over others or to differentiate between LAB, were used to detect individual LAB types during cheese storage. Commercial strains of Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium spp. were initially screened on the 6 selective media along with nonstarter LAB (NSLAB) isolates. The microbial flora of the cheeses was analyzed during 9 mo of storage at 6 degrees C. Many NSLAB were able to grow on media presumed selective for Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium spp., or Lb. acidophilus, which became apparent after 90 d of cheese storage, Between 90 and 120 d of storage, bacterial counts changed on media selective for Bifidobacterium spp., suggesting growth of NSLAB. Appearance of NSLAB on Lb. casei selective media [de man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS)+vancomycin] occurred sooner (30 d) in low-fat cheese than in full-fat control cheeses. Differentiation between NSLAB and Lactococcus was achieved by counting after 18 to 24h when the NSLAB colonies were only pinpoint in size. Growth of NSLAB on the various selective media during aging means that probiotic adjunct cultures added during cheesemaking can only be enumerated with confidence on selective media for up to 3 or 4 mo. After this time, growth of NSLAB obfuscates enumeration of probiotic adjuncts. When adjunct Lb. casei or Lb. paracasei cultures are added during cheesemaking, they appear to remain at high numbers for a long time (9 mo) when counted on MRS+vancomycin medium, but a reasonable probability exists that they have been overtaken by NSLAB, which also grow readily on this medium. Enumeration using multiple selective media can provide insight into whether it is the actual adjunct culture or a NSLAB strain that is being enumerated.
TI  - [Species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacillus in infants].
AB  - AIM: To study species composition and antibiotic resistance of indigenous bacteria from Lactobacillus genus in infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six strains of lactobacilli isolated from feces of infants living in Kazan. Species membership of lactobacilli was determined using PCR with primers for identification of 7 species of lactobacilli: L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. zeae. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by indicator paper discs method. RESULTS. In breastfed infants L. fermentum and L. rhamnosus dominated, whereas in artificially fed infants colonization with L. casei and L. paracasei was characteristic. L.acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. zeae were not detected in infants. In 6 cases isolates could be identified only to genus characteristic. Lactobacilli were polyresistant and had from 8 to 15 markers of resistance. All strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, nitroxoline, metronidazole, furazolidone, and 95% of strains were resistant to vancomycin. In 60-70% of cases lactobacilli were susceptible to penicillin, linezolid, erythromycin and lyncomycin. CONCLUSION: Regional features of species composition and antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli in infants depending on type of feeding were revealed.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Effects of multistrain probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy  for Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adjuvant effects of probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection have not been evaluated. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with persistent H. pylori infection, after first-line triple therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either triple therapy with (yogurt group, n=151) or without (control group, n=186) Will yogurt. Triple therapy consisted of 400 mg moxifloxacin q.d., 1000 mg amoxicillin b.i.d., and 20 mg esomeprazole b.i.d. for 14 days. Will yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus. H. pylori eradication was evaluated by the (13)C-urea breath test, histology, or the rapid urease test. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 66.7% and 68.9% in the control and yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.667). The eradication rates by per-protocol analysis were 78.5% and 86% in the control and the yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.110). The adverse event rates were 25.3% and 28.5% in the control group and yogurt group, respectively (P=0.508). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of yogurt containing probiotics to moxifloxacin-containing second-line treatment neither improved H. pylori eradication rates nor reduced the adverse events of treatment.
TI  - Isoflavone phytoestrogens in soymilk fermented with beta-glucosidase producing probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Isoflavones significantly contribute to human health and disease prevention, and  exist as glucosides and aglycones. The beta-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosides to aglycones is very sensitive to molecular structure, and thus the profile of the isoflavones can affect their rate of hydrolysis. Soymilk was fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus B4496 (La), Lactobacillus bulgaricus CFR2028 (Lb), Lactobacillus casei B1922 (Lc), Lactobacillus plantarum B4495 (Lp) and Lactobacillus fermentum B4655 (Lf) for 48 h at 37 degrees C. beta-Glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis was carried out in soymilk. During fermentation, maximum growth was seen at 24 h with Lb, Lc, Lp and Lf and at 48 h with La. Polyphenol content ranged from 12.98 to 17.90 at 24 h and from 12.44 to 15.24 mg/100 ml at 48 h of fermentation. All the lactic acid bacteria produced beta-glucosidase enzyme, which hydrolyzed isoflavone glucosides to aglycones at a significant level (P < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk.
TI  - [Classification of domestic probiotic cultures of Lactobacillus genus].
AB  - AIM: To study strains of bacteria from Lactobacillus genus using combination of microbiological and molecular biological methods in order to define more accurately their systematic position and biochemical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen cultures of Lactobacillus bacteria isolated from stool of healthy persons were studied: L. plantarum CS 396, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum 421-2, L. fermentum 90-TC-4, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526, L. acidophilus Er 317/402 NARINE, L. acidophilus 100 ash, L. acidophilus NK-1, L. acidophilus NNIE, L. acidophilus K3sh24, L. brevis gKNM 23 11, L. casei gKNM 577. Their enzymatic activity relative to 50 sugars was studied using API-50 system. Structure of proximal region of 16S rRNA gene was studied also. RESULTS: According to results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis strains were divided on 2 groups: 1) L. casei gKNM 577, L. plantarum 8-PA-3, L. plantarum CS 396, which species belonging corresponded to stated description. Comparison of nucleotide sequence of 16S rRNA gene of group 2 strains with nucleotide sequences database revealed that cultures NK-1, Er315/402 NARINE, 100 ash, NNIE identified early as L. acidophilus belong to species L. helveticus; L. brevis gKNM 23 and L. acidophilus K3sh24--to group L. casei/paracasei, L. delbrueckii gKNM 101 and L. fermentum 90-TC-4--to L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii gKNM 526--to L. fermentum, and L. plantarum 421-2--to L. rhamnosus. CONCLUSION: Obtained data allowed to perform taxonomic reclassification of species belonging of studied probiotic cultures of lactobacilli according to modem level of systematic of bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical Lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  - The evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. Ninety-two strains from the genus Lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included in the investigation. Species tested were the L. acidophilus group, L. casei group, L. reuteri/fermentum group, and L. sakei/curvatus group. Cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble whole cell proteins were analyzed. Antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. The vanA and tet genes were confirmed. Resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. The natural glycopeptide resistance within the L. casei group and L. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vanA gene present. Therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. Tet-(A), -(B), -(C), -(M), or -(O) gene could not be detected. The protein fingerprinting within the L. casei group proved that L. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. For safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vanA gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of probiotics from yoghourt in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. METHODS: Probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. The recovered isolates were characterized by Gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: MRS medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees C were the optimum condition of culture. In total, 52 probiotic isolates were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Gram's stain showed that 37 isolates were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. These 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. All 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. A small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.
TI  - Anti-allergic effects of probiotic Dahi through modulation of the gut immune system.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The alarming increase in allergy in the last few decades demands the development of new anti-allergic prevention strategies, and consumption of functional foods (i.e. probiotic Dahi, which has already been proven to enhance immunity by modulation of the gut mucosal immune system) may be one of them. In the present study, we evaluated anti-allergic effects of a Dahi (yogurt) containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei and normal Dahi culture Lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (named probiotic Dahi) on ovalbumin induced allergy in mice. METHODS: Allergy was induced by injecting (i.p.) ovalbumin at 0 and 14 days. Animals were fed with standard diet (control), milk, control Dahi or probiotic Dahi for 21 days. Total and ovalbumin-specific IgE, cytokines and lymphocyte proliferation index were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days. RESULTS: Feeding of probiotic Dahi completely suppressed the elevation of total and ovalbumin-specific IgE in the serum of ovalbumin-injected mice. Similarly, splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic Dahi entirely lost the total and ovalbumin-specific IgE production property during in-vitro culture. Production of T helper (Th)-1 cell-specific cytokines, i.e. interferon -gamma and interleukin (IL)-2, increased, while Th2-specific cytokines, i.e. IL-4 and IL-6, decreased in the supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice fed with probiotic Dahi compared to the other groups. Moreover, ovalbumin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was strongly suppressed by feeding of probiotic Dahi in comparison to milk and control Dahi. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicate that probiotic Dahi suppressed ovalbumin-induced allergic consequences characterized by decreasing levels of total and ovalbumin-specific IgE and lymphocyte proliferation and skewed ovalbumin-induced Th2-specific immune response towards Th1-specific response.
TI  - Intestinal lactobacilli and the DC-SIGN gene for their recognition by dendritic cells play a role in the aetiology of allergic manifestations.
AB  - Diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in Westernized communities. The development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. The present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific Lactobacillus species and genetic variations in DC-SIGN, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and sensitization in infancy. Within the KOALA Birth Cohort Study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five Lactobacillus species: L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. reuteri. Eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the DC-SIGN gene were genotyped in these children. Allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of AD and sensitization (specific IgE) at age 2 years. L. rhamnosus (31.5 %), L. paracasei (31.3 %) and L. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas L. casei (2.5 %) and L. reuteri (<1 %) were rare. Colonization with L. paracasei decreased the risk of AD significantly (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of L. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). Two DC-SIGN polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. The present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. Firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in DC-SIGN in association with the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. Therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.
TI  - Human mucosal in vivo transcriptome responses to three lactobacilli indicate how  probiotics may modulate human cellular pathways.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria, specific representatives of bacterial species that are a common part of the human microbiota, are proposed to deliver health benefits to the consumer by modulation of intestinal function through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. To explore in vivo mucosal responses of healthy adults to probiotics, we obtained transcriptomes in an intervention study after a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. In the mucosa of the proximal small intestine of healthy volunteers, probiotic strains from the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, and L. rhamnosus each induced differential gene-regulatory networks and pathways in the human mucosa. Comprehensive analyses revealed that these transcriptional networks regulate major basal mucosal processes and uncovered remarkable similarity to response profiles obtained for specific bioactive molecules and drugs. This study elucidates how intestinal mucosa of healthy humans perceives different probiotics and provides avenues for rationally designed tests of clinical applications.
TI  - New method for electroporation of Lactobacillus species grown in high salt.
AB  - We here describe a new method for electroporation of Lactobacillus species, obligately homofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative, based on the cell-wall weakening resulting from growth in high-salt media. For L. casei, optimum transformation efficiency of up to 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA was achieved following growth in the presence of 0.9 M NaCl. Plasmids of different sizes and replication origins were also similarly transformed. These competent cells could be used either directly or stored frozen, up to 1 month, for future use, with similar efficiency. This protocol was assayed with different Lactobacillus species: L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum and L. acidophilus, and it was found that they were transformed with similar efficiency.
TI  - [Identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PCR method for identifying the 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus  and Streptococcus thermophilus at the species level. METHODS: Optimizing the method for DNA extraction and the conditions for PCR amplification. Joining the PCR amplification products from 16S rRNA to plasmid puc18-T and detecting the sequence. RESULTS: All 50 isolates recovered from yoghourt products were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and 7 groups were identified as L. bulgaricus (24 strains), S. thermophilus (12 strains), L. acidophilus (7 strains), L. casei (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (2 strains), L. fermentum (1 strain) and S. lutetiensis (1 strain). CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA PCR method developed in this research is a sensitive and reliable method for the identification of both Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Phytase activity from Lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  - The presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. This study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of LAB including: Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4962, ATCC33200, ATCC4356, ATCC4161, L. casei ASCC290, L. plantarum ASCC276, and L. fermentum VRI-003. Activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. Most strains produced phytase under both conditions with L. acidophilus ATCC4161 showing the highest activity. Phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with L. acidophilus ATCC4962 and L. acidophilus ATCC4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. All strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately pH 5. However, no phytate degradation could be observed.
TI  - Physico-chemical properties, probiotic survivability, microstructure, and acceptability of a yogurt-like symbiotic oats-based product using pre-polymerized whey protein as a gelation agent.
AB  - Consumption of a food product containing prebiotics and probiotics has been recognized as an important factor in lowering risk of intestinal cancer and gastrointestinal diseases and risks associated with high cholesterol. An oats-based symbiotic yogurt-like food (Oagurt) was developed using oats and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium), with pre-polymerized whey protein (PWP) as a gelation agent. The product was also fortified with inulin to increase soluble fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Physico-chemical analyses and 9 wk shelf life for viability of probiotics and changes in pH and viscosity were carried out for formulations with (F) and without (C) fortification. Results of the shelf life study showed that both L. casei and Bifidobacterium remained at therapeutic levels: 4.8 x 10(6) CFU/g (F), 4.3 x 10(6) CFU/g (C) and 3.1 x 10(6) CFU/g (F), 3.17 x 10(6) CFU/g (C) after 9 wk. However L. acidophilus did not survive after 3 wk. Viscosity and pH decreased significantly during the study with the difference between formulations also significant for pH (P < 0.0001). Scanning electron microscopy of samples revealed that the pre-polymerized whey protein played a major role in the structure of the gel with an increased protein network structure visible at higher PWP levels. A consumer acceptability study showed that the product was "fair" for all organoleptic attributes.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Invasion of the gut by pathogenic Salmonella leads to production of IL-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. However, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress IL-8 production prevent tissue damage. We hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of IL-8 synthesis. Caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis W52, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactococcus lactis W58, Lactobacillus acidophilus W70, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, or Lactobacillus salivarius W24 or pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell for 1 hour. Cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of Salmonella as either co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by Salmonella (1 hour). The cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. IL-8 and Hsp70 were determined by ELISA and Western blot respectively. Both probiotics and Salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of IL-8 but probiotics induced far lower IL-8 levels than Salmonella. The Salmonella-induced IL-8 was significantly suppressed by B. infantis W52, L. casei W56 and L. lactis W58 at low numbers of Salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. The observed probiotic-mediated reduction in IL-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. In addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in Hsp70 expression while L. acidophilus W70, B. bifidum W23 and L. salivarius W24 induced a weak Hsp70 expression and could not suppress the Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis. We conclude that suppression of Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis by Caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of Hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via Hsp70 expression. This suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic Salmonella.
TI  - Bioconversion of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and  vitamin B complex in fermented soymilk by probiotic bacteria and yeast.
AB  - AIM: To study the role of beta-glucosidase producing probiotic bacteria and yeast in the biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones, mineral bioavailability and vitamin B complex in fermented soymilk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five isolates of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus B4496, Lactobacillus bulgaricus CFR2028, Lactobacillus casei B1922, Lactobacillus plantarum B4495 and Lactobacillus fermentum B4655 with yeast Saccharomyces boulardii were used to ferment soymilk to obtain the bioactive isoflavones, genistein and daidzein. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the concentration of isoflavones. Bioactive aglycones genistein and daidzein after 24 and 48 h of fermentation ranged from 97.49 to 98.49% and 62.71 to 92.31% respectively with different combinations of LAB with yeast. Increase in bioavailability of minerals and vitamin B complex were also observed in fermented soymilk. CONCLUSIONS: LAB in combination with yeast S. boulardii has great potential for the enrichment of bioactive isoflavones, enhancing the viability of LAB strains, decreasing the antinutrient phytic acid and increasing the mineral bioavailability in soymilk fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Fermentation of soymilk with probiotic organisms improves the bioavailability of isoflavones, assists in digestion of protein, provides more soluble calcium, enhances intestinal health and supports immune system. Increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk improves the biological functionality of soymilk.
TI  - Decrease in frequency of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients given the multispecies probiotic VSL#3: a pilot trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea has adverse consequences for critically ill patients, health care staff, and health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the multispecies probiotic VSL#3 in reducing the mean number of episodes of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was done in a 6-bed intensive care unit in a 330-bed public hospital in Australia. A total of 45 adults (20 intervention, 25 control) who required enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were given VSL#3 or a placebo twice daily. The frequency (mean number of episodes per patient per day) and weight (grams per day) were determined for both liquid stool and liquid and loose (unformed) stool. RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients had no demographic or clinical differences. Patients received enteral nutrition for a mean of 8.5 days (SD, 5.4) and were studied for a mean of 11.9 days (SD, 5.6). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant reduction in the frequency of liquid stools (incidence rate ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.93; P = .03). Smaller but still significant differences also occurred between the groups in both the frequency of episodes and the weight of liquid and loose (unformed) stool. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 was effective in reducing the frequency of liquid stool in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. Probiotics possibly can minimize diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed patients, but more controlled clinical trials are needed.
TI  - Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei mix sensitize colorectal tumoral cells to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis.
AB  - To assess the potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei strains to increase the apoptosis of a colorectal cancer cell line in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), LS513 colorectal cancer cells were treated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of these lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the presence of 100 mu g/ml of 5-FU. In the presence of 10(8) CFU/ml of live LAB, the apoptotic efficacy of the 5-FU increased by 40%, and the phenomenon was dose dependent. Moreover, irradiation-inactivated LAB caused the same level of induction, whereas microwave-inactivated LAB reduced the apoptotic capacity of the 5-FU. When cells were treated with a combination of live LAB and 5-FU, a faster activation of caspase-3 protein was observed, and the p21 protein seems to be downregulated. These results suggest that live L. acidophilus and L. casei are able to increase the apoptosis-induction capacity of 5-FU. The mechanisms of action are still not elucidated, and more research is needed to understand them. This is the first set of experiments demonstrating that some strains of LAB can enhance the apoptosis-induction capacity of the 5-FU. Based on these results, it is possible to speculate that LAB or probiotics could be used as an adjuvant treatment during anticancer chemotherapy.
TI  - Effect of prebiotics on viability and growth characteristics of probiotics in soymilk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soy products have attracted much attention lately as carriers for probiotics. This study was aimed at enhancing the growth of probiotics in soymilk via supplementation with prebiotics. RESULTS: Lactobacillus sp. FTDC 2113, Lactobacillus acidophilus FTDC 8033, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, Bifidobacterium FTDC 8943 and Bifidobacterium longum FTDC 8643 were evaluated for their viability and growth characteristics in prebiotic-supplemented soymilk. In the presence of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, mannitol, maltodextrin and pectin, all strains showed viability exceeding 7 log(10) colony-forming units mL(-1) after 24 h. Their growth was significantly (P < 0.05) increased on supplementation with maltodextrin, pectin, mannitol and FOS. Additionally, supplementation with FOS, mannitol and maltodextrin increased (P < 0.05) the production of lactic acid. Supplementation with FOS and maltodextrin also increased the alpha-galactosidase activity of probiotics, leading to enhanced hydrolysis and utilisation of soy oligosaccharides. Finally, prebiotic supplementation enhanced the utilisation of simpler sugars such as fructose and glucose in soymilk. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with prebiotics enhances the potential of soymilk as a carrier for probiotics.
TI  - Removal of cholesterol by lactobacilli via incorporation and conversion to coprostanol.
AB  - Fifteen strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were screened based on their ability to adhere to hydrocarbons via the determination of cellular hydrophobicity. Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314, L. acidophilus FTCC 0291, Lactobacillus bulgaricus FTCC 0411, L. bulgaricus FTDC 1311, and L. casei ATCC 393 showed greater hydrophobicity and, thus, were selected for examination of cholesterol-removal properties. All selected strains showed changes in cellular fatty acid compositions, especially total fatty acids and saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of cholesterol compared with those grown in the absence of cholesterol. In addition, we found that cells grown in media containing cholesterol were more resistant to sonication and enzymatic lysis compared with those grown without cholesterol. We further evaluated the location of the incorporated cholesterol via the insertion of fluorescence probes into the cellular membrane. In general, enrichment of cholesterol was found in the regions of the phospholipid tails, upper phospholipids, and polar heads of the cellular membrane phospholipid bilayer. Our results also showed that lactobacilli were able to reduce cholesterol via conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol, aided by the ability of strains to produce cholesterol reductase. Our results provided experimental evidence to strengthen the hypothesis that probiotics could remove cholesterol via the incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane and conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol. The strains studied may be potential health adjunct cultures in fermented dairy products with possible in vivo hypocholesterolemic effects.
TI  - Intestinal Lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  - The higher counts or particular groups (Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. We further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. The questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (BDC-LDL) of blood sera were explored. The PCR-based intestinal Lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (LAB) were tested. The facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. The number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). In elderly consuming probiotics the LAB counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (OR=1.71, CI95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (BMI). The colonization by L. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to L. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (OR=0.16, CI95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). However, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with Lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for BMI (Adj. R(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. The higher white blood cells (WBC) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of Lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and BMI (Adj. R(2)=0.193, p=0.027). The lower values of ox-LDL were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and BMI (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; Adj. R(2)=0.184 p=0.029). In conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with WBC count, blood glucose and content of ox-LDL which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
TI  - Pategras cheese as a suitable carrier for six probiotic cultures.
AB  - The viability of five single-strain and one three-strain probiotic cultures was assessed during Pategras cheese ripening. Probiotics were inoculated into cheese-milk after a pre-incubation step - intended to improve their survival - or directly as a lyophilised culture; control cheeses without probiotics were also obtained. pH of probiotic and control cheeses was similar, except in probiotic cheeses containing the strain Lb. acidophilus B or the mixed culture. In these cases, the probiotic cheeses were more acid than their respective control cheeses. All the probiotics tested maintained counts above 107 cfu/g during the shelf-life settled for the product. Strains of the Lb. casei group: Lb. paracasei, Lb. casei and Lb. rhamnosus reached and kept the highest cell concentration during cheese ripening, followed by Lb. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. The direct addition of the probiotic cultures was more efficient than their inoculation after a pre-incubation step, for all the probiotics assayed. We have provided evidence that support the use of Pategras cheese as a performing food-based vehicle for probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Dose-response efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formula of Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea prophylaxis in adult patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Standard therapies for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) have limited efficacy. Probiotic prophylaxis is a promising alternative for reduction of AAD and CDAD incidence. METHODS: In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study, we randomized 255 adult inpatients to one of three groups: two probiotic capsules per day (Pro-2, n=86), one probiotic capsule and one placebo capsule per day (Pro-1, n=85), or two placebo capsules per day (n=84). Each probiotic capsule contained 50 billion c.f.u. of live organisms (Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 +Lactobacillus casei LBC80R Bio-K+ CL1285). Probiotic prophylaxis began within 36 h of initial antibiotic administration, continued for 5 days after the last antibiotic dose, and patients were followed for an additional 21 days. RESULTS: Pro-2 (15.5%) had a lower AAD incidence vs. Pro-1 (28.2%). Each probiotic group had a lower AAD incidence vs. placebo (44.1%). In patients who acquired AAD, Pro-2 (2.8 days) and Pro-1 (4.1 days) had shorter symptom duration vs. placebo (6.4 days). Similarly, Pro-2 (1.2%) had a lower CDAD incidence vs. Pro-1 (9.4%). Each treatment group had a lower CDAD incidence vs. placebo (23.8%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were less common in the treatment groups vs. placebo and in Pro-2 vs. Pro-1. CONCLUSIONS: The proprietary probiotic blend used in this study was well tolerated and effective for reducing risk of AAD and, in particular, CDAD in hospitalized patients on antibiotics. A dose-ranging effect was shown with 100 billion c.f.u., yielding superior outcomes and fewer gastrointestinal events compared to 50 billion c.f.u. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00958308).
TI  - Fermentation of Metroxylon sagu resistant starch type III by Lactobacillus sp. and Bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  - The in vitro fermentability of sago (Metroxylon sagu) resistant starch type III (RS(3)) by selected probiotic bacteria was investigated. Sago RS(3) with 12% RS content was prepared by enzymatic debranching of native sago starch with pullulanase enzyme, followed by autoclaving, cooling, and annealing. The fermentation of sago RS(3) by L. acidophilus FTCC 0291, L. bulgaricus FTCC 0411, L. casei FTCC 0442, and B. bifidum BB12 was investigated by observing the bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption profiles, pH changes, and total short chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced in the fermentation media. Comparisons were made with commercial fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), Hi-maize 1043, and Hi-maize 240. Submerged fermentations were conducted in 30 mL glass vials for 24 h at 37 degrees C in an oven without shaking. The results indicated that fermentation of sago RS(3) significantly (P < 0.05) yielded the highest count of Lactobacillus sp. accompanied by the largest reduction in pH of the medium. Sago RS(3) was significantly the most consumed substrate compared to FOS and Hi-maizes.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant microorganism and the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. The antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria against MRSA from ten human clinical isolates as well as MRSA standard strain ATCC 43300 was tested in vitro. The Lactobacillus (Lb.) strains (Lb. acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lb. casei LBC80R) as pure cultures, which came from commercial food products were employed. The growth inhibitory effect produced by the antimicrobial activity of the lactic acid bacteria on the MRSA strains was tested on solid medium using agar diffusion methods as well as a using a liquid medium procedure that contained a mixture of MRSA and lactic acid bacteria cultures. In the latter instance, we were able to demonstrate that the direct interaction of lactic acid bacteria and MRSA in such a mixture led to the elimination of 99% of the MRSA cells after 24 h of their incubation at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  - Microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. In the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. This has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. They play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. They are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Probiotic microorganisms include the LAB Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. The advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. Components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.
TI  - Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity and bioconversion of isoflavones by probiotics in soymilk supplemented with prebiotics.
AB  - Lactobacillus sp. FTDC 2113, L. acidophilus FTDC 8033, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356,  L. casei ATCC 393, Bifidobacterium FTDC 8943 and B. longum FTDC 8643 were incorporated into soymilk supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, mannitol, maltodextrin and pectin. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of prebiotics on the bioactivity of probiotic-fermented soymilk. Proteolytic activity was increased in the presence of FOS, while the supplementation of inulin and pectin increased the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity accompanied by lower IC(50) values. The beta-glucosidase activity was also enhanced in the presence of pectin. This led to higher bioconversion of glucosides to aglycones by probiotics, especially genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. Results from this study indicated that the supplementation of prebiotics enhanced the in-vitro antihypertensive effect and production of bioactive aglycones in probiotic-fermented soymilk. Therefore, this soymilk could potentially be used as a dietary therapy to reduce the risks of hypertension and hormone-dependent diseases such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and osteoporosis.
TI  - A standard quantitative method to measure acid tolerance of probiotic cells.
AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a standard quantitative method to measure the acid tolerance of probiotic cells when exposed to a simulated gastric fluid. Three model strains of different cell concentrations were exposed to a standard simulated gastric fluid of fixed volume. The fluid pH ranged from pH 1.5 to 2.5. In general, the death kinetics followed an exponential trend. The overall death constant, k (d), for all strains was found to be in a power relationship with the pH value and the initial cell concentration, and it can be expressed as k(d)=k(AII) (pH(-9.0)N(0)(-0.19)) where k (AII) is defined as the acid intolerance indicator and N (0) is the initial cell concentration (CFU/ml). This equation was validated with the experimental data with an average R (2) of 0.98. The acid intolerance of cells can be quantitatively expressed by the k (AII) values, where higher value indicates higher intolerance. In conclusion, a standard quantitative method has been developed to measure the acid tolerance of probiotic cells. This could facilitate the selection of probiotic strains and processing technologies.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. Decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. Probiotics are a large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. AIM OF THE STUDY: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. Children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei, with Lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). According to their age, children were vaccinated with DTP-Hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. RESULTS: Final analysis of results was done in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. There was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. Days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. The high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activities of Sinapis alba L. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and L. casei. The active component of S. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and HPLC and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. The antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. Phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of C. difficile and C. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. Furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of E. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and E. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. In conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. Bif. longum B6 (53.6%) and Lact. rhamnosus GG (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in Ped. acidilactici (10.4%). Bifidobacterium longum B6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with Listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), Shigella boydii (42.0%) and Staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG had the strong binding ability to Caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Sh. boydii and Staph. aureus to Caco-2 cells. The hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion and in vivo colonization. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Bif. longum B6 and Lact. rhamnosus GG can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the GI tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.
TI  - Probiotic cheddar cheese: influence of ripening temperatures on proteolysis and sensory characteristics of cheddar cheeses.
AB  - Bifidobacterium longum 1941, B. animalis subsp. lactis LAFTI B94, Lactobacillus casei 279, Lb. casei LAFTI L26, Lb. acidophilus 4962, or Lb. acidophilus LAFTI L10 were used as an adjunct in the production of Cheddar cheeses, which were ripened at 4 and 8 degrees C for 24 wk. Effects of ripening temperatures and probiotic adjuncts on proteolysis and sensory evaluation of the cheeses were examined. Higher ripening temperature increased the level of proteolysis in the cheeses. Product of proteolysis and organic acids released during ripening were shown to be important for the flavor of Cheddar cheeses. There were positive and significant correlations between the levels of soluble nitrogen, lactic, acetic, and butyric acids, percentage hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-CN and beta-CN to the scores of cheddary flavor (P < 0.05). Scores for sour-acid and vinegary flavors were higher in cheeses with the addition of Bifidobacterium sp. or Lb. casei 279 ripened at 8 degrees C. The scores were positively and significantly correlated to the level of lactic, acetic, and free amino acids in the cheeses (P < 0.05). The results show that both 4 and 8 degrees C have potential for use in the ripening of probiotic Cheddar cheeses.
TI  - Intervention of Acidophilus-casei dahi and wheat bran against molecular alteration in colon carcinogenesis.
AB  - An in vivo trial was conducted on seventy five rats allocated to three groups, first group was DMH control group, second group was Wheat bran-DMH group (WB-DMH) in which wheat bran was given along with DMH (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) injection, third group was Wheat bran-DMH-Ac Dahi group in which both wheat bran and Acidophilus-casei dahi (a probiotic microorganisms fermented dairy product) was given along with DMH injections. Animals received subcutaneous injections of DMH at a dose rate of 20 mg/kg body weight, once weekly for 15 weeks. The rats were dissected at 40th week of experiment and comet assay was done in colonic cells to assess the DNA damage. The c-myc and cox-2 expression was studied in rat tumour. A significant reduction in DNA damage (48.2%) was observed in WB-DMH-Ac Dahi group as compared to DMH control group (87.8%). The c-myc and cox-2 mRNA level was found highest in DMH control group as compared to WB-DMH and WB-DMH-Ac Dahi group. The results of present study show the enhanced protective potential of Acidophilus-casei and wheat bran against DMH induced molecular alteration in colonic cells during carcinogenesis.
TI  - Antioxidant and cholesterol assimilation activities of selected lactobacilli and  lactococci cultures.
AB  - In present study, three strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) viz. Lactobacillus  casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactococcus lactis and milk fermented with these strains have been studied for antioxidant and cholesterol assimilation activities in-vitro and in-vivo, in addition to the effect on total lactobacilli, lactococci and coliform counts into the gut of mice fed with diets supplemented by fermented milk. All three selected strains exhibited potent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, malonaldialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging abilities as well as inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation activity. These activities were highest in Lb. casei as followed by Lb. acidophilus and Lc. lactis. In addition, these bacterial cultures also exhibited good in-vitro cholesterol assimilation potential. Oral administration to mice of milk fermented with selected LAB strains, slightly decreased blood cholesterol, increased colonization of total lactobacilli and lactococci, and decreased coliforms in the intestinal tissues as well as faecal samples. These results indicate that, selected LAB strains have good antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic and coliform removal activities. It may suggest that, a novel functional food can be obtained by supplementation of selected LAB in milk, which may have various health beneficial properties such as antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic activities.
TI  - Multivariate analysis of proteolysis patterns differentiated the impact of six strains of probiotic bacteria on a semi-hard cheese.
AB  - The individual contribution of 6 strains of probiotic bacteria (3 of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 3 of the Lactobacillus casei group) to proteolysis patterns in a semi-hard cheese was assessed. Control cheeses (without probiotics) and 2 types of experimental cheeses (with the addition of probiotics either directly to milk or by a 2-step fermentation method) were manufactured. Cheeses containing Lb. acidophilus showed the most extensive peptidolysis, which was evidenced by changes in the peptide profiles and a noticeable increase of free amino acids compared with control cheeses. The strains of the Lb. casei group showed a lower contribution to cheese peptidolysis, which consisted mainly of free amino acid increase. Two-step fermentation improved peptidolytic activity for only one of the cultures of Lb. acidophilus tested. The addition of Lb. acidophilus strains into cheese may be suitable not only for their beneficial health effect but also for their influence on secondary proteolysis, consistent with acceleration of ripening and improved flavor formation.
TI  - Live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli adherence to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - A quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated Lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of Caco-2 cells. Three species of Lactobacillus (L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (L. casei, L. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. All lactobacilli were able to attach to the Caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. The adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). The inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal L. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. The inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated L. acidophilus (p > 0.01). The number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the Caco-2 cells decreased when the number of L. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The heat-inactivated L. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
TI  - Does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? Strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. The leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) was evaluated together with its uptake by superficial dental enamel. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). Strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following Fuji Ortho LC application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. RESULTS: Strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. At the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. Under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS: RMGIC releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. No significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. However synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.
TI  - Inhibition of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine induced colon genotoxicity in rats by the administration of probiotic curd.
AB  - Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that the probiotic organisms are effective in preventing colon carcinogenesis, which is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in western countries. Keeping this in view, a curd (a common Indian fermented milk product) was prepared by the addition of probiotic cultures Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and curd culture Lactococcus lactis biovar. diacetylactis. In present study, we have evaluated the anti tumor effect of probiotic curd by monitoring the DNA damage through comet assay. The rats were allocated to four groups, first group was DMH control group, second group was probiotic curd group in which probiotic curd was given along with DMH (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) injection, third group was normal curd group in which normal curd was given along with DMH injection and fourth group was normal control group. Animals received subcutaneous injection of DMH dissolved in normal saline at a dose rate of 20 mg/kg body weight, once weekly for 15 weeks. The rats were dissected at 40th week of experiment and comet assay was done in colonic cells to assess the DNA damage. A significant reduction in DNA damage (54.7%) was observed in probiotic curd group as compared to DMH control group (88.1%). The probiotic curd was effective to significantly reduce the L:W ratio in comparison to DMH control group and normal curd. The results of present study show the protective effects of probiotic curd against DMH induced genotoxicity in colonic cells.
TI  - Development and use of tuf gene-based primers for the multiplex PCR detection of  Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei group, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Bifidobacterium longum in commercial dairy products.
AB  - PCR primers specific for the detection of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei group, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Bifidobacterium longum were designed based on the elongation factor Tu gene (tuf). The specificity of these four primer sets were confirmed by PCR with 88 bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and other bacterial species. Results indicated that these primer sets generated predicted PCR products of 397, 230, 202, and 161 bp for L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei group, and B. longum, respectively. Bacterial species other than the target organisms tested did not generate false-positive results. When these four primer sets were combined for the simultaneous detection of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermented milk products including yogurt, the LAB species listed on the labels of these products could be identified without the preenrichment step. The identification limit for each LAB strain with this multiplex PCR method was N X 10(3) CFU/ml in milk samples. The results of our multiplex PCR method were confirmed by PCR assay using primers based on the 16S rDNA or the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region and by biochemical tests using the API 50 CHL kit. When this multiplex PCR method was used with the determination of counts of total viable LAB and bifidobacteria, the quality of commercial fermented milk products could be assured.
TI  - Pretreatment but not treatment with probiotics abolishes mouse intestinal barrier dysfunction in acute pancreatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal barrier failure during acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with translocation of luminal bacteria, resulting in infectious complications. We examined the effects of multispecies probiotics on the intestinal barrier impairment in a murine model of AP. METHODS: Mice were injected with cerulein to induce AP and were sacrificed 11 (early AP) or 72 hours (late AP) after start of induction. AP and associated systemic effects were confirmed by histology of pancreas and lung. Animals received daily probiotics starting 2 days prior to AP induction (pretreatment) or at the moment of AP induction (treatment). Mucosal barrier function of the distal ileum was assessed in Ussing chambers by measurement of the epithelial electrical resistance and the permeability to Na-fluorescein. RESULTS: Histological analysis revealed pancreatic injury in both phases of AP, and lung damage in the early phase. Epithelial resistance of the ileum was reduced and permeability increased in both phases of AP, indicating impairment of the intestinal barrier. Pretreatment had no effect on resistance or permeability in the early phase of AP. In the late phase of AP, pretreatment but not treatment abolished the AP induced resistance decrease and permeability increase. Administration of probiotics as such (ie, without induction of AP) had no effect on intestinal barrier function. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with multispecies probiotics for 2 days abolishes intestinal barrier dysfunction in the late phase of AP, while treatment does not. The effectiveness of probiotics in this model depends on the timing of administration. Clinical trials with probiotics should seek conditions where treatment can be started prior to onset of disease or elective surgical intervention.
TI  - Dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei has a protective effect against Salmonella enteritidis infection in mice.
AB  - Salmonella enteritidis infection has received attention during recent years owing to its high prevalence worldwide. In the present study, the protective effect of probiotic dahi (curd) supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei against Salmonella enteritidis infection in mice is investigated. Seven days pre-feeding with probiotic dahi significantly increased anti-S. enteritidis sIgA (secretary IgA) antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation in S. enteritidis infected mice. IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma production were significantly increased in supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi, while IL-4 levels were not changed significantly. Moreover, activities of beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase, and counts of S. enteritidis in intestine, liver and spleen were decreased, whereas total lactobacilli in faeces were increased in mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi. Pre-feeding of probiotic dahi for 7 days was more effective than 2 days pre-feeding. Thus, the results indicate that, pre-feeding with probiotic dahi ameliorated S. enteritidis infection by stimulating specific and non-specific immune response. Above all, it lowered colonization of gastrointestinal tract as well as translocation of S. enteritidis.
TI  - Identification of probiotic lactobacilli used for animal feeds on the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence.
AB  - The use of probiotics such as Lactobacillus in animal feeds has gained popularity in recent years. In this study the 16S rRNA gene sequence of L. acidophilus in two commercial agents which have been used in animal feeds, LAB-MOS and Ghenisson 22, was determined. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the two agents, strain MNFLM01 in LAB-MOS and strain GAL-2 in Ghenisson 22, belonged to L. rhamnosus (a member of the L. casei group) and L. johnsonii (a member of the L. acidophilus group), respectively. Biochemical tests assigned the two as L. rhamnosus and ambiguously as L. acidophilus. The data suggest that 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis provides more accurate identification of Lactobacillus species than biochemical tests and would allow quality assurance of relevant commercial products. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains MNFLM01 and GAL-2 determined in this study have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession numbers under accession numbers AB288235 and AB295648, respectively.
TI  - Kinetics of microbial hydrogenation of free linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic  acids.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the ability of selected probiotic bacterial strains to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and also to estimate the biohydrogenation kinetics of Lactobacillus acidophilus on the production of CLA from free linoleic acid (LA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Six probiotic bacteria, Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus GG, Lact. acidophilus ADH, and Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lact. brevis, and Lact. casei, were used to examine their ability to convert LA to CLA. LA tolerance was evaluated by addition of different LA concentrations in MRS broth. Lact. acidophilus showed the major tolerant to LA and the greatest CLA-producing ability (36-48 microg ml(-1) of CLA). The rate-controlling steps were k(2) and k(1) for the addition of 1 and 3 mg ml(-1) of LA, respectively. The percentage of CLA conversion was higher in MRS broth supplemented with 1 mg ml(-1) (65%) than 3 mg ml(-1) (26%). CONCLUSION: The results provide useful information and new approach for understanding the biohydrogenation mechanisms of CLA production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study would help elucidate the pathway from LA to stearic acid (SA), known as biohydrogenation. In addition, the use of selected probiotic bacteria might lead to a significant improvement in food safety.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of different self-etching primers and adhesives.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of different one-step and two-step self-etching primer/adhesives on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial effects of Clearfil Protect Bond Primer and Bonding agent; AdheSE Primer and Bonding agent; Adper Prompt L-Pop; Futurabond NR; Clearfil Tri S Bond; and Cervitec (positive control, 1% chlorhexidine varnish) were tested against standard strains of S. mutans, L. Casei, and L. acidophilus using the disk diffusion method. Standard filter paper disks (n=5) impregnated with 20 microL of each material were prepared. After incubation at 37 masculineC for 48 hours in a 5-10% CO2 atmosphere, the diameter of inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. Data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Duncan's Multiple Range Test was used for pairwise comparison. RESULTS: The size of inhibition zones produced by primer/adhesives varied among the brands. AdheSE Primer: S. mutans (20.6+/-1.51); L. casei (14.8+/-1.78); L. acidophilus (11.4+/-0.54). Adper Prompt L-Pop: S. mutans (19.6+/-1.51); L. casei (13.8+/-1.64); L. acidophilus (13.8+/-1.09). Cervitec: S. mutans (23+/-0.00); L. casei (27+/-0.70); L. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). Clearfil Protect Bond Primer: S. mutans (17+/-0.00); L. casei (17.6+/-0.54); L. acidophilus (22.4+/-0.54). Futurabond NR was found effective only against S. mutans (14.6+/-1.67). Of all the materials tested, AdheSE Bonding agent, Clearfil Protect Bond Bonding agent, and Clearfil Tri S Bond exhibited no inhibition zone (-) for all bacteria tested. CONCLUSION: Among the adhesives tested Clearafil Protect Bond Primer based upon monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridiniium bromide (MDPB) was found to be the most potent material against L. acidophilus and L. casei. AdheSE Primer and Adper Prompt L-Pop are highly effective against S. mutans. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with other adhesive systems, Clearfil Protect Bond Primer (containing MDPB) showed a high antibacterial effect against all microorganizms tested. Two-step, self-etching primer/adhesive system Clearfil Protect Bond might be a suitable choice under minimally invasive restorations. The recently developed one-step, self-etching system Clearfil Tri S Bond showed no antibacterial effect against microorgazims tested.
TI  - Acid production from sugars and sugar alcohols by probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in vitro.
AB  - Some probiotic bacterial strains have been suggested to improve oral health. However, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are associated with the progression of dental caries. The pH fall caused by 14 probiotic and dairy bacterial strains from glucose, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol and xylitol was followed. All strains used glucose, nine lactose and seven sucrose. Six of the lactobacilli caused a small decrease in pH with sorbitol and two with xylitol. None of the bifidobacteria fermented sugar alcohols. As all the strains could be considered acidogenic, more long-term clinical trials are needed before recommendations for oral health purposes can be made.
TI  - Effects of a multi-strain probiotic (PrimaLac) on performance and antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus vaccination in broiler chickens.
AB  - The effects of the probiotic PrimaLac (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium bifidium) was investigated on performance and immune responses to vaccination against Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease in broiler chickens. Use of PrimaLac significantly (P<0.05) enhanced broiler performance by improving body weight and decreasing the feed conversion ratio. Although administration of the probiotic appeared to improve the antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease vaccination, the antibody titres of the probiotic-treated group were not significantly different from those not receiving probiotics.
TI  - The effects of probiotics on PPI-triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful Helicobacter pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-seven H. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control group, n = 179). Triple therapy consisted of PPI b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. Yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of Will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. Will yogurt (a Korean brand) contains Lactobacillus acidophilus HY2177, Lactobacillus casei HY2743, Bifidobacterium longum HY8001, and Streptococcus thermophilus B-1. (13)C-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. Eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. RESULTS: By intention-to treat analysis the H. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). However, by per-protocol (PP) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). Common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). The frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). However, most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. But it increased the H. pylori eradication rate by PP analysis, encouraging more research in this field.
TI  - Early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  - Following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. We hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and NEC. Caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (COLOS; n = 5), formula (FORM; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (FORM-P; Bifidobacterium animalis and Lactobacillus: L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum; n = 13). Clinical NEC scores were reduced (P < 0.05) in FORM-P (2.0 +/- 0.2) and COLOS groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with FORM pigs (3.4 +/- 0.6). Lower NEC scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, RNA integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase A and N activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the FORM-P and COLOS groups (P < 0.05). Diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between FORM-P and FORM pigs. FORM-P pigs had lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, Clostridium perfringens, and had commensal Lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to FORM pigs. These results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of NEC.
TI  - [Indication and identification of Lactobacillus spp. with the use of polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - AIM: The aim of the work is the development of laboratory test for indication and identification of Lactobacillus spp. by the polymerase chain reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The work is developed on the base of the GenBank/EMBL data about genetic sequences of the Lactobacillus spp. The sequences of DNA were studied with the help of the ClustalW program. The strains of the Lactobacillus spp., which are the object of the research, have been registered in Russian collection of industrial microorganisms. RESULTS: The laboratory test of nested-PCR for indication and identification L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus was performed. The specificity of the nested-PCR was correlated with the control analyses of monoculture Lactobacillus spp. and commercial products. CONCLUSION: The new developed laboratory nested-PCR test may be use in control system of milk foods enriched by probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - Single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator for study of survival of probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design an in vitro model system to evaluate the probiotic potential of food. A single bioreactor system-gastrointestinal tract simulator (GITS) was chosen for process simulation on account of its considerable simplicity compared to multi-vessel systems used in previous studies. The bioreactor was evaluated by studying the viability of four known probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533, Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) as a function of their physiological state. L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii survived in GITS better when introduced at an early stationary or exponential phase compared to being previously stored for 2 weeks at 4 degrees C. These two species were more resistant to bile salts and survived better than L. casei and L. rhamnosus GG. The latter two species gave large losses (up to 6 log) in plate counts independent of growth state due to the bile. However, experiments with some commercial probiotic products containing Lb. GG bacteria showed much better survival compared with model food (modified deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe growth medium), thus demonstrating the influence of the food matrix on the viability of bacteria. The study demonstrated that GITS can be successfully used for evaluation of viability of probiotic bacteria and functionality of probiotic food.
TI  - The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. Recent studies indicated that some Lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. However, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. Therefore, we examined the effects of Lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (Cl(-)/OH(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells. Postconfluent Caco-2 cells were treated with the Lactobacillus species Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA), Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)Cl uptake in base-loaded cells. Treatment with live, but not heat-killed, LA and LR significantly increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. Similarly, the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live LA increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange. The ability of LA or its conditioned culture medium to enhance Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity was blocked by PI-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Corresponding to the increased Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity, LA treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, SLC26A3 [Down Regulated in Adenoma (DRA)]. The increased DRA membrane localization might contribute to the increased Cl(-) absorption by LA. Our results suggest that LA secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical Cl(-)/OH(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.
TI  - Skim milk powder supplementation affects lactose utilization, microbial survival  and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones in soymilk by Lactobacillus.
AB  - Four probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus 4461, L. acidophilus 4962, Lactobacillus casei 290 and L. casei 2607, were used for fermentation of soymilk (SM) prepared from soy protein isolate (SPI) supplemented with skim milk powder (SMP) (SSM). Soymilk and reconstituted skim milk (RSM) were used as controls. Lactose utilization in SSM by these probiotic organisms ranged from 14.97 to 18.15mg/ml, compared to 14.12-16.06mg/ml for RSM. The pH in SSM dropped to 4.07-4.29 compared to 6.15-6.36 for SM and 4.10-4.96 for RSM. The microbial viable counts were also significantly enhanced by up to 0.98logCFU/ml by the supplementation of SMP to SM. The biotransformation level of isoflavone glycosides (IG) to isoflavone aglycones (IA) in SSM ranged from 81.4% to 85.1%, which was 13.9-19.0% higher than that for SM, after 24h of incubation. Most of IG in SSM was completely converted to IA, except malonyl glycitin and malonyl genistin. At the end of the incubation, IA comprised up to 76.8% of total isoflavones in SSM.
TI  - Functional characteristics of Lactobacillus spp. from traditional Maasai fermented milk products in Kenya.
AB  - In this study functional characteristics of 23 representative Lactobacillus strains isolated from the Maasai traditional fermented milk 'Kule naoto' were determined. The Lb. acidophilus group strains showed resistance to gastric juice and bile. In addition, some Lb. acidophilus strains expressed bile salt hydrolase activity, and had ability to assimilate cholesterol in vitro. In-vitro adhesion to HT29 MTX cells of up to 70% was recorded. Lb. fermentum strains showed almost 100% survival under simulated stomach acidic conditions and physiological salt concentrations of bile salts, hydrophobicity values were over 80%. Most strains of the Lb. casei and Lb. acidophilus groups showed aggregation abilities of above 50%. Many strains expressed a protective effect against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induced DNA damage according to the 'comet assay' and none was virulent. The antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration of selected strains was established. According to these results, the Lactobacillus spp associated with 'Kule naoto', contain potentially probiotic (functional) strains.
TI  - Oral administration of dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei delayed the progression of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.
AB  - In this study, the effect of dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus  NCDC14 and Lactobacillus casei NCDC19 (73 x 10(8) cfu/g) on progression of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats (15 g/day/rat) for 28 days was investigated. Feeding of probiotic dahi significantly suppressed the incremental peaks and area under the curve and delayed reduction of insulin secretion during oral glucose tolerance test more than skim milk or control dahi. The feeding of milk products reduced the total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and VLDL-cholesterol and increased HDL-cholesterol levels (P<0.05). Moreover, probiotic dahi significantly suppressed STZ-induced oxidative damage in pancreatic tissues by inhibiting the lipid peroxidation and formation of nitric oxide, and preserving antioxidant pool such as glutathione content and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The results suggest that the supplementation of probiotic Lb. acidophilus and Lb. casei with dahi cultures increased the efficacy of dahi to suppress STZ-induced diabetes in rats by inhibiting depletion of insulin as well as preserving diabetic dyslipidemia, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation and nitrite formation. This may empower antioxidant system of beta-cells and may slow down the reduction of insulin and elevation of blood glucose levels.
TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  - According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
TI  - Effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (DFM) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. Fifteen mature Thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 Latin square design balanced for carryover effects. Within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (LS; 1.2 g of starch x kg of BW(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (HS; 2.4 g of starch.kg of BW(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. The DFM treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of BW x d) as follows: no DFM (CON; control), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC1; single-species DFM), or a mixture of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Enterococcus faecium (LAC4; multiple-species DFM). Total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (LS; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (AC; abrupt change in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (HS; high dietary starch collection). Data collected consisted of total DM intake and fecal output, fecal pH, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of DFM in the feed. With the exception of Fe digestibility, there were no starch x DFM interactions. There was an effect of starch level (P <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for Mg (P = 0.08) and CP, K, and Zn (P > 0.10). Horses supplemented with LAC4 had increased ether extract (P < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased Na (P < 0.10) digestibilities compared with CON horses. All DFM-supplemented horses had increased Cu (P < 0.05) and Fe and numerically increased Zn digestibilities compared with CON horses. Fecal pH decreased (P < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (P < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from LS to HS. There was a tendency for elevated fecal pH (P < 0.10) in LAC1 horses compared with CON horses. These results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. Supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. The potential response of DFM supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.
TI  - Effect of lactulose on biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones in soymilk by lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus 4461, L. acidophilus 4962, L. casei 290, and L. casei 2607 were used to hydrolyze isoflavone glycosides (IG) to biologically active forms--isoflavone aglycones (IA)--in soymilk (SM) prepared from soy protein isolate (SPI) and soymilk supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) of lactulose (SML). L. acidophilus 4461 utilized the highest level of lactulose (3.01 mg/mL) and L. acidophilus 4962 utilized the least (0.86 mg/mL) at 24 h of incubation. The pH values decreased to 4.00 to 5.00 in SML, while they remained relatively high (6.15 to 6.36) in SM. Supplementation with lactulose significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the viable counts of all the 4 Lactobacillus strains. At the end of incubation, the viable counts of Lactobacillus ranged from 8.08 to 8.25 log CFU/mL in SML compared to 6.99 to 7.11 log CFU/mL in SM. Supplementation with lactulose increased the biotransformation of IG to IA after 6 h of incubation. The presence of lactulose in the medium enhanced the biotransformation level of IG to IA by Lactobacillus up to 21.9%. The hydrolysis level of malonyl genistin and acetyl genistin in SML was much higher than in SM by all the 4 probiotic organisms. The biotransformation of IG to IA occurred rapidly during the 1st 12 h of incubation in both SML and SM. Among the 4 Lactobacillus strains, L. acidophilus 4461 biotransformed the highest level (88.8%) of IG to IA in SML compared to 68.2% in SM after 24 h of incubation.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. LAB mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. Two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five ATCC reference Lactobacillus strains. Thirty six isolates showed activity in the agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. However, only six cell free supernatants (CFS) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. L. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas L. plantarum and L. fermentum were the most resistant ones. Identification by MIDI system indicated that these LAB isolates were Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus casei GC subgroup A. The antagonistic factors produced by most of these LAB against L. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees C for 10 min) and stable over a wide pH range (4.0 to 9.0). These data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.
TI  - The effect of probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on gastropathic consequences in diabetic rats.
AB  - In the present study, the effects of oral administration of probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on gastropathic consequences in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were evaluated, and effects were compared with skim milk- and control dahi-fed groups. The feeding of probiotic dahi did not change the blood glucose levels in chronic hyperglycemic conditions. The rate of charcoal transit was significantly higher in probiotic dahi-fed animals than in those of the diabetic control group (P < .05). Moreover, the oral administration of probiotic dahi significantly increased counts of lactobacilli adherent to epithelial walls and free in the lumen of the small and large intestine, while decreasing attached as well as free coliform counts (P < .05). In addition, probiotic dahi reversed the decrease in total lactobacilli and increase in total coliforms in fecal samples of diabetic animals. It was also shown that oral ingestion of probiotic dahi reduced the oxidative stress marker thiobarbituric acid-reactive species in intestinal tissues and glycosylation of hemoglobin (P < .05). All the effects were predominantly higher in the probiotic dahi-fed group than the skim milk- and control dahi-fed groups. The results indicate that probiotic dahi may be used as a therapeutic regimen to diminish the gastropathic consequences of diabetes.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - Proteolytic profiles and angiotensin-I converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Two strains each of yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (L. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and L. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of Bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) at 37 degrees C and their proteolytic profiles and ACE as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. Among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. The growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in pH for the organisms. All the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. The variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ACE inhibitory potential of these organisms. Bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ACE inhibitory potential followed by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, L. casei 15286, S. thermophilus 1275, and L. acidophilus 4461. Organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. Also, aminopeptidases of strains of L. acidophilus 4461 and S. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ACE inhibitory potential. Lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.
TI  - Fermentation of reconstituted skim milk supplemented with soy protein isolate by  probiotic organisms.
AB  - Utilization of lactose and production of organic acid were determined in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) and RSM supplemented with soy protein isolate (SPI) (RSMS) by 6 probiotic organisms, including L. acidophilus 4461, L. acidophilus 4962, L. casei 290, L. casei 2607, B. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, and B. longum 20099. The viable counts of probiotic organisms of RSM and RSMS were enumerated and pH measured during fermentation. Our results showed that 3% to 10% more lactose was utilized by all the 6 probiotic microorganisms from RSMS than RSM. All 6 probiotic organisms produced significantly more acetic acid in RSMS than RSM. However, the viable microbial populations in RSMS were lower than those in RSM due to lower pH of the former. It appears that addition of SPI enhanced lactose utilization and acetic acid production but slightly reduced the lactic acid production and the growth of probiotic microorganisms.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus 43121 and a mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum on the serum cholesterol level and fecal sterol excretion in hypercholesterolemia-induced pigs.
AB  - The hypocholesterolemic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus 43121 (43121) and a  mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum (MIX) were studied in hypercholesterolemia-induced pigs. Serum total cholesterol was decreased by supplementation of either 43121 or MIX, although, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not changed. The hypocholesterolemic effect of 43121 and MIX was mainly due to bile acid dehydroxylation, this effect being supplementation-time dependent.
TI  - Gut immune stimulation by non pathogenic Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria. Comparison with a probiotic strain.
AB  - We analyzed the gut immune stimulation induced by Gram-positive bacteria: non probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1462 and Lactobacillus acidophilus A9; two potentially probiotic strains: L. acidophilus CRL 924 and Lactobacillusdelbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 423; comparatively with a probiotic strain: Lactobacillus casei CRL 431. We also studied Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli 129 and E. coli 13-7 in BALB/c mice. All the strains increased the number of IgA+ cells. We analyzed the cytokines IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-17, IL-12, IL-6 and MIP-1alpha. The Gram(+) strains increased the number of IL-10+ cells. Gram(-) strains did not increase IL-10+ cells, but they increased the number of IL-12+ cells. The probiotic strain increased mainly IFNgamma and TNFalpha. In the study of the receptors TLR-2, TLR-4 and CD-206, we demonstrated that only the probiotic strain increased the number of CD-206+ cells. All the Gram(+) strains increased the number of TLR-2+ cells and the Gram(-) strains of the TLR-4+ cells. The probiotic strain induced the release of IL-6 by a preparation enriched in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria activated different immune receptors and induced a different cytokine profile. The probiotic strain showed a great activity on the immune cells and the enriched population in IEC, activating mainly cells of the innate immune system.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of Lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of Candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Antagonistic activities of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21), L. casei ATCC 27216, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards E. coli strain K12, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis test cultures were studied. The bactericidal effect of L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (pH 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. Adhesion of C. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. L. fermentum strain 90 TS-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.
TI  - Probiotic Crescenza cheese containing Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  - High-pressure homogenization (HPH) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. Its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. To evaluate the potential of milk treated by HPH for the production of Crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: HPH (from HPH-treated milk), P (from pasteurized milk), HPH-P (HPH-treated milk plus probiotics), and P-P (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. Compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees C). According to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and pH. Differently, the HPH treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. In fact, after 12 d of storage, the Lactobacillus paracasei A13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus H5 exhibited, in P-P cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the HPH-P cheese. The hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. Also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. No significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among HPH and P cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among HPH, HPH-P, and P-P Crescenza cheeses.
TI  - Effect of Versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, Versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (RSM), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum) was examined. Addition of Versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of S. thermophilus and B. longum but inhibited that of L. casei, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. This is also reflected in the extent of reduction of pH in RSM with added Versagel by these organisms. Among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except B. longum was adversely affected by the presence of Versagel, although the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. Versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ACE inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
TI  - Production of beta-glucosidase and hydrolysis of isoflavone phytoestrogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus casei in soymilk.
AB  - The study determined beta-glucosidase activity of commercial probiotic organisms  for hydrolysis of isoflavone to aglycones in fermenting soymilk. Soymilk made with soy protein isolate (SPI) was fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10, Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI B94, and Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26 at 37 degrees C for 48 h and the fermented soymilk was stored for 28 d at 4 degrees C. beta-Glucosidase activity of organisms was determined using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis of isoflavone glycosides to aglycones by these organisms was carried out. The highest level of growth occurred at 12 h for L. casei L26, 24 h for B. lactis B94, and 36 h for L. acidophilus L10 during fermentation in soymilk. Survival after storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d was 20%, 15%, and 11% greater (P < 0.05) than initial cell counts, respectively. All the bacteria produced beta-glucosidase, which hydrolyzed isoflavone beta-glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. The decrease in the concentration of beta-glycosides and the increase in the concentration of aglycones were significant (P < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk. Increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk is likely to improve the biological functionality of soymilk.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. There is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as Lactobacillus. The hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains are effected by PPIs. METHODS: Nineteen different strains of Lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at pH of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/mL to 2.5 microg/mL. Bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to pantoprazole. RESULTS: In the unexposed (control) group, nine Lactobacilli strains were affected by pH changes from 6.5 to 4.5. In the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 Lactobacilli strains were found to have an MIC below 625 microg/mL, with L. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (MIC = 20 microg/mL). In some strains, such as L. s. salivarius 11741, Gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. CONCLUSION: Growth rates and morphology of oral Lactobacillus are affected by the pH of the environment. Pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. SIGNIFICANCE: The balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of PPI pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.
TI  - Prebiotics enhance survival and prolong the retention period of specific probiotic inocula in an in vivo murine model.
AB  - AIM: To identify novel prebiotics that could be used to maintain persistence of three representative probiotic strains in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Test mice were treated with prebiotics soybean oligosaccharide (SOS), fructooligosaccharide (FOS) or inulin, followed by probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 (L10), Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI B94 (B94) or Lactobacillus casei L26 LAFTI (L26). Faecal samples were then collected and analysed using selective medium and PCR analysis to determine the presence of the probiotic strains. In contrast to the control groups, in mice fed prebiotics, the survival and retention time of the test probiotics was increased extensively. SOS and FOS prolonged the retention period of L10 from 24 to 30 h. Of the three prebiotics, FOS gave the best result with B94, prolonging the retention period from 3 to > or =10 days. Of the three prebiotics, inulin gave the best result for L26, prolonging the retention period from 2 to > or =6 days. CONCLUSIONS: The prebiotics SOS, FOS and inulin significantly enhance survival and prolong the retention period of L10, B94 and L26 in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results demonstrate the potential use of FOS, inulin and SOS as prebiotics in conjunction with the probiotic strains L10, B94 and L26 for new synbiotic products.
TI  - Fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with Lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  - The objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of Lactobacillus, namely, L. acidophilus ATCC 4962, ATCC33200, ATCC 4356, ATCC 4461, L. casei ASCC 290, L. plantarum ASCC 276, and L. fermentum VRI-003. The parameters that were used are viability, pH, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. Calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees C. Soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA). Organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using HPLC. Viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) CFU/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d storage at 4 degrees C. After 24 h, there was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in soluble calcium. L. acidophilus ATCC 4962 and L. casei ASCC 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. The increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered pH associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. Fermentation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. Our results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.
TI  - Effect of a fermented milk combining Lactobacillus acidophilus Cl1285 and Lactobacillus casei in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is an important problem in hospitalized patients. The use of probiotics is gaining interest in the scientific community as a potential measure to prevent this complication. The main objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a fermented milk combining Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei that is widely available in Canada, in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized study, hospitalized patients were randomly assigned to receive either a lactobacilli-fermented milk or a placebo on a daily basis. RESULTS: Among 89 randomized patients, antibiotic-associated diarrhea occurred in seven of 44 patients (15.9%) in the lactobacilli group and in 16 of 45 patients (35.6%) in the placebo group (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.125 to 0.944; P=0.05). The median hospitalization duration was eight days in the lactobacilli group, compared with 10 days in the placebo group (P=0.09). Overall, the lactobacilli-fermented milk was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The daily administration of a lactobacilli-fermented milk was safe and effective in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Incorporation of citrus fibers in fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The incorporation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 903, Lactobacillus casei CECT 475 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 870 together with lemon (LF) and orange (OF) fibers obtained from juice by-products were tested in (i) a model system: fiber enriched with de Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) broth cultured with each probiotic bacteria and (ii) evaluation of populations of probiotic bacteria in fermented milks formulated with citrus fibers. Citrus fibers enhanced L. acidophilus CECT 903, and L. casei CECT 475 survival in MRS during refrigerated storage, whereas erratic results were obtained for B. bifidum CECT 870, OF enhanced its growth and LF had inhibitory effect. Populations of probiotic bacteria decreased with storage time in MRS broth. The presence of yogurt starter bacteria in probiotic fermented milks favored the growth and survival of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum. Citrus fiber presence in fermented milks also enhanced bacterial growth and survival of the tested probiotic bacteria. This study indicates that citrus fiber enriched fermented milk have good acceptability and are good vehicles for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of B. bifidum will need to be improved.
TI  - Endogenous beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities from selected probiotic micro-organisms and their role in isoflavone biotransformation in soymilk.
AB  - AIM: To compare endogenous beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases for hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glycosides into isoflavone aglycones in order to improve biological activity of soymilk. METHODS AND RESULTS: beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities of probiotic organisms including Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4461, Lactobacillus casei 2607 and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 in soymilk were evaluated and correlated with the increase in concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. The concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a Varian model high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an amperometric electrochemical detector. In all micro-organisms, beta-glucosidase activity was found greater than that of beta-galactosidase. There was an increase in the aglycone concentration with incubation time because of the apparent hydrolytic action on isoflavone glycosides. Aglycone concentration in the soymilk with L. acidophilus 4461, L. casei 2607 and B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, increased by 5.37-, 5.52- and 6.10-fold, respectively, after 15 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The maximum hydrolytic potential was also observed at 15 h of fermentation for the three micro-organims coinciding with peak activities of the two enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: beta-glucosidase activity was more than 15 times higher than beta-galactosidase activity in soymilk for each of the micro-organisms during fermentation. beta-glucosidase played a greater role in isoflavone glycoside hydrolysis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening for beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities among probiotics in soymilk is important for the improvement of biological activity of soymilk and in the selection of micro-organisms for use in the growing industry of functional foods and beverages.
TI  - A comparative study of the preventative effects exerted by three probiotics, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in the TNBS model of rat colitis.
AB  - AIMS: The intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of three probiotics with immunomodulatory properties, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, were evaluated and compared in the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Colitis was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 10 mg of TNBS dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol. Each probiotic was administered orally (5x10(8) CFU suspended in 0.5 ml of skimmed milk) for 3 weeks, starting 2 weeks before the administration of TNBS. Colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically 1 week after TNBS instillation. The results obtained revealed that all probiotics assayed showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, macroscopically evidenced by a significant reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. Only B. lactis showed a lower incidence of diarrhoea in comparison with untreated rats. Biochemically, all probiotics restored colonic glutathione levels, depleted as a consequence of the oxidative stress of the inflammatory process. Bifidobacterium lactis treatment reduced colonic tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression; L. acidophilus administration reduced colonic leukotriene B4 production and iNOS expression and L. casei intake was associated with a decrease in colonic COX-2 expression. CONCLUSION: The three probiotics assayed have shown intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in the TNBS model of rat colitis, although each probiotic shows its own anti-inflammatory profile. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These probiotics could be considered as potential adjuvants in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although more studies are required in order to demonstrate their efficacy in humans.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis populations].
AB  - The effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. The three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (Lactobacillus casei CRL_431 and L. acidophilus CRL_730 CHR HANSEN) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR-35) culture. About 10(9) CFU/ mL of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees C during its shelf life, about 30 days. Bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. Results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over S. aureus, E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The yogurt with added probiotics and L. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. S. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. This study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. Nevertheless, the use of L. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - A comparison of changes in the transformation of isoflavones in soymilk using varying concentrations of exogenous and probiotic-derived endogenous beta-glucosidases.
AB  - AIMS: To compare endogenous and exogenous beta-glucosidases for the hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glucosides in soymilk in order to improve the biological activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: beta-glucosidase activity of probiotic organisms, including Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4461 and Lactobacillus casei 2607 in soymilk, was evaluated and was related to the increase in the concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. The concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a Varian model HPLC with an Amperometric electrochemical detector. The aglycone composition, also known as aglycone equivalent ratio, has been considered to be important for the delivery of health benefits of isoflavones, and was monitored during the fermentation of soymilk. Comparison of the hydrolytic effectiveness of both exogenous and endogenous enzyme during 4-h incubation in soymilk was conducted using the Otieno-Shah (O-S) index. Results showed that exogenous enzyme exhibited faster rate of isoflavone glucoside hydrolysis than that by endogenous enzyme. Highest O-S indices were obtained after 4, 3 and 2 h of incubation with enzyme solution having beta-glucosidase activity of 0.288 U ml(-1), 0.359 U ml(-1) and 0.575 U ml(-1), resulting into aglycone concentration increments of 5.87-, 6.07- and 5.94-fold, respectively. Conversely, aglycone concentration in the soymilk with B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb12, L. casei 2607 and L. acidophilus 4461 increased by 3.43-, 2.72- and 3.03-fold, respectively, after 4 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. In addition, the O-S index of endogenous enzyme was much lower than that of the exogenous enzyme over the same 4-h incubation period. Optimum aglycone equivalent ratios coincided with highest O-S indices and highest aglycone concentrations in soymilk hydrolysed with exogenous enzyme. The same correlation of O-S indices and highest aglycone concentrations occurred for endogenous enzyme during the 24 h of fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Obtaining highest aglycone concentration and optimum aglycone equivalent ratio could provide a critical beginning point in clinical trials for the realization of unique health benefits of soy isoflavones. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening for beta-glucosidase activities of probiotics in soymilk and comparing their hydrolytic potentials with that of exogenous beta-glucosidase could find wide applications in the development of different aglycone-rich functional soy beverages.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of 4 commercial bleaching agents (Day White, Colgate Platinum, Whiteness 10% and 16%) on 6 oral pathogens (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus) and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. A chlorhexidine solution was used as a positive control, while distilled water was the negative control. Bleaching agents and control materials were inserted in sterilized stainless-steel cylinders that were positioned under inoculated agar plate (n = 4). After incubation according to the appropriate period of time for each microorganism, the inhibition zones were measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (a = 0.05). All bleaching agents and the chlorhexidine solution produced antibacterial inhibition zones. Antimicrobial activity was dependent on peroxide-based bleaching agents. For most microorganisms evaluated, bleaching agents produced inhibition zones similar to or larger than that observed for chlorhexidine. C albicans, L casei, and L acidophilus were the most resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Selected prebiotics support the growth of probiotic mono-cultures in vitro.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to identify suitable prebiotics for synergistic  combinations with representative probiotics from the lactobacilli and bifidobacterium genera. Eleven different types of commercially available carbohydrates and compounds were screened in basal media for their effects on the growth of the probiotic cultures Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 (L10), Bifidobacterium animalis lactis LAFTI B94 (B94) and Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26 (L26). Growth of these probiotics was investigated by measuring optical density (OD) levels over a period of 48 h. The results of this study showed that all three probiotic strains were able to utilize a range of carbohydrates. Maximal growth of L10 was observed in basal medium supplemented with soybean oligosaccharide (SOS), followed by fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin, while maximal growth of B94 was observed in basal medium supplemented with SOS, followed by raffinose, FOS, beta-glucan hydrolysate, inulin and Fibregum TAN. L26 was shown to exhibit maximal growth in basal medium supplemented with FOS followed by inulin, SOS, beta-glucan hydrolysate and beta-glucan concentrate. The results of this study indicate that several carbohydrates/compounds can enhance the growth of these representative probiotic strains in vitro.
TI  - Design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the final design of the probiotic. Specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. METHODS: From a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a simulated gastrointestinal environment. Functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. RESULTS: Specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (Ecologic 641); Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis. Combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of IL-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. CONCLUSIONS: Application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - Formation of oligosaccharides in skim milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures, Lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis and probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
AB  - Milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures NCDC167, Lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis NCDC60 and two probiotic strains; Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC14 and Lb. casei NCDC19 were evaluated after fermentation (14 h) and during 8 d storage at 7 degrees C. The beta-galactosidase activity was found to increase after fermentation leading to the hydrolysis of lactose and production of glucose, galactose and oligosaccharides; that subsequently decreased during storage. The viable counts of lactococci and lactobacilli decreased during storage yet remained >106 cfu/ml after storage. The results of present study indicate that all the selected cultures have ability to produce oligosaccharides (prebiotics) due to transgalactosidal and lactose hydrolysis activities of beta-galactosidase. The cultures developed an active synbiotic formula by maintaining sufficient probiotic viable counts to exert health benefits to the consumers.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  - The outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. This study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. We isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. All the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. A Multiplex-PCR with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. All bifidobacteria were B. animalis subsp. lactis except one Bifidobacterium longum. Sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. The lactobacilli were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The streptococci were all Streptococcus thermophilus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. All tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, rifampicin (MIC(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml); resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B and spectinomycin (MIC(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). The susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.
TI  - Similarity and differences in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  - A set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis, DNA typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. On microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of L. johnsonii. When projected on the NCC533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. A quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile DNA. Signatures for horizontal gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in DNA from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. On microarray hybridizations, Lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence intensities than the L. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from L. acidophilus hybridized to the L. johnsonii array. In-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of L. johnsonii with L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with Lactobacillus casei; and scattered X-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. The observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the L. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. Modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.
TI  - [Influence of selected Lactobacillus sp. on Clostridium difficile strains with different toxigenicity profile].
AB  - This study was performed for determination of antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus spp. (L. plantarum 2017405, L. rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus DSM 21007 and L. fernmentumn 353) on Clostridiunl difficile strains belonging to different toxigenicity profiles. Forty strains C. difficile isolated from patients suffering from antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) were used. Among C. difficile strains 13 produced toxin A and B (A+B+CDT-), 14 produced only toxin B (AB'CDT), 9 produced toxins A and B and possessing of binary toxin genes (A+B+CDT-) and 4 were non-toxigenic (A-B-CDT-). We did not observe relationship between degree of antagonistic activity Lactobacillus spp. and profile of toxigenicity of C. difficile strains.
TI  - Antidiabetic effect of probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in high fructose fed rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of low-fat (2.5%) dahi containing probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei on progression of high fructose-induced type 2 diabetes in rats. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding 21% fructose in water. The body weight, food and water intakes, fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, oral glucose tolerance test, plasma insulin, liver glycogen content, and blood lipid profile were recorded. The oxidative status in terms of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and reduced glutathione contents in liver and pancreatic tissues were also measured. RESULTS: Values for blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, glucose intolerance, plasma insulin, liver glycogen, plasma total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood free fatty acids were increased significantly after 8 wk of high fructose feeding; however, the dahi-supplemented diet restricted the elevation of these parameters in comparison with the high fructose-fed control group. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased slightly and was retained in the dahi-fed group. The dahi-fed group also exhibited lower values of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and higher values of reduced glutathione in liver and pancreatic tissues compared with the high fructose-fed control group. CONCLUSION: The probiotic dahi-supplemented diet significantly delayed the onset of glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress in high fructose-induced diabetic rats, indicating a lower risk of diabetes and its complications.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Non-enterococcal Gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious infections. However, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. Because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the MICs of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. The activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; Lactobacillus casei, 1; Lactobacillus fermentum, 2; Lactobacillus brevis, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1; Weissella confusa, 2; Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; Leuconostoc lactis, 4; Pediococcus acidilactici, 2; Pediococcus pentosaceus, 1), isolated from clinical specimens in an Argentinian university hospital from 1997 to 2003. The MICs of penicillin for 67% of the Lactobacillus strains and 100% of the Leuconostoc spp. and Pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/mL range. Erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. Multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; Lactobacillus plantarum, 1).
TI  - [The electron microscopic study of cell-to-cell interactions between antagonistic microorganisms].
AB  - The electron microscopic study of thin sections and positively stained specimens  of cells taken from particular cocultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus D75, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018, Shigella flexnery 2a, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (some of these bacteria are antagonistic to others) showed the presence of specific ultrastructural elements indicating cell specialization and cooperation. The responses of antagonistic bacteria manifested themselves at the cellular and population levels.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - Improvement of protein production in lactic acid bacteria using 5'-untranslated leader sequence of slpA from Lactobacillus acidophilus. Improvement in protein production using UTLS.
AB  - The 5'-untranslated leader sequence (UTLS) of the slpA gene from Lactobacillus acidophilus contributes to mRNA stabilization by producing a 5' stem and loop structure, and a high-level expression system for the lactic acid bacteria was developed using the UTLS in this study. A plasmid, which expresses alpha-amylase under the control of the ldh promoter, was constructed by integrating the core promoter sequence with the UTLS. The role of the UTLS in increasing the copies of the alpha-amylase mRNA was proved by measuring alpha-amylase activity in the culture supernatant and the relative expression of alpha-amylase mRNA was determined by the quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Moreover, several expression systems were constructed by combining the core promoter sequence with the UTLS or with the partially deleted UTLS and the expression level was evaluated. The use of the UTLS led to the success in improving alpha-amylase expression in the two strains of Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis. The current study showed that the improvement in protein production using the UTLS could be applied to the expression system in the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. The mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (LA) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from LA by certain bacterial strains. In this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of CLA was assessed. Incubation of probiotic bacteria (VSL3, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, B. infantis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of LA yielded CLA production as measured by gas chromatography. Conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced CLA, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, as assessed by MTT assay and DNA laddering, respectively. Western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of PPARgamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with LA alone. Incubation of murine feces with LA after administering VSL3 yielded 100-fold more CLA than feces collected prior to VSL3 feeding. This study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus strains on cancer cell proliferation and oxidative stress in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess in vitro, whether heat-killed (HK) lactic acid bacteria cells and fractionations of HK cells could suppress the viability of human cancer cells and inhibit the cytotoxicity associated with oxidative stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among the strains, the HK cells of Lactobacillus acidophilus 606 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 exhibited the most profound inhibitory activity in all of the tested cell lines. HK cells of L. acidophilus 606 were determined to be less toxic to healthy human embryo fibroblasts (hEF cells) than were HK cells of L. casei ATCC 393. The soluble polysaccharides from L. acidophilus 606 evidenced the most effective anticancer activity, but inhibited hEF cell growth by only 20%. The soluble polysaccharides from L. acidophilus 606 were partly observed to induce apoptosis in the HT-29 cells by DNA fragmentation and propidium iodine staining. Both the HK cells of L. acidophilus 606 and the soluble polysaccharide components of this strain also exhibited potent antioxidative activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the soluble polysaccharide fraction from L. acidophilus 606 may constitute a novel anticancer agent, which manifests a high degree of selectivity for human cancer cells and antioxidative agent in the food industry. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These soluble polysaccharide components from Lactobacillus may be applied to various foods, and used as adjuncts for cancer therapy and prevention.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of fecal Lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  - The developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. Generally, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. In intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. However, the Lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. For accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rRNA intergenic spacer regions, were developed for Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different Lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (SF) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (OSF). A breast-fed group (BF) was studied in parallel as a reference. During the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the BF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the OSF group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). The Lactobacillus species distribution in the OSF group was comparable to breast-fed infants, with relatively high levels of L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, and L. casei. The SF-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more L. delbrueckii and less L. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and OSF-fed infants. An infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of BF infants.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - Viability of commercial probiotic cultures (L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium sp.,  L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus) in cheddar cheese.
AB  - Six batches of cheddar cheese were manufactured containing different combinations of commercially available probiotic cultures from three suppliers. Duplicate cheeses contained the organisms of each supplier, a Bifidobacterium spp. (each supplier), a Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 suppliers), and either Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, or Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Using selective media, the different strains were assessed for viability during cheddar cheese maturation over 32 weeks. The Bifidobacterium sp. remained at high numbers with the three strains being present in cheese at 4 x 10(7), 1.4 x 10(8), and 5 x 10(8) CFU/g after 32 weeks. Similarly the L. casei (2 x 10(7) CFU/g), L. paracasei (1.6 x 10(7) CFU/g), and L. rhamnosus (9 x 10(8) CFU/g) strains survived well; however, the L. acidophilus strains performed poorly with both decreasing in a similar manner to be present at 3.6 x 10(3) CFU/g and 4.9 x 10(3) CFU/g after 32 weeks. This study indicates that cheddar cheese is a good vehicle for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of L. acidophilus strains will need to be improved.
TI  - Use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral Lactobacillus species.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genus Lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. A considerable heterogeneity among Lactobacillus species has been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA (16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for the identification of 13 reference strains of Lactobacillus. METHODS: The 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified by PCR using universal primers and digestion of PCR products with the restriction endonucleases, HpaII and HaeIII. The 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating Lactobacillus strains to species level. Seventy-seven Lactobacillus isolates from a Thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. RESULTS: PCR-RFLP alone had limitations, because the RFLP patterns of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus and of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by SDS-PAGE. Of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as L. rhamnosus, 5 as Lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as L. casei, 3 as L. acidophilus and 1 as Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP, using HpaII and HaeIII, together with SDS-PAGE protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral Lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of Lactobacillus to dental caries.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. Some species of Lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) producers. Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. It immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. It is known that N-9 inhibits Lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. PURPOSE: The present study was conducted to identify the species of Lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the H(2)O(2)-producing and N-9-resistant strains in an Argentine population. RESULTS: We identified Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, L. casei subsp. casei, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. In this Argentine, South American population, 62% of women had H(2)O(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. We found a high number of sensitive strains. Sixty-two H(2)O(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to N-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of N-9. DISCUSSION: The vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among Argentine women as in other countries, and (2) N-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of plasmid pLC494 isolated from human intestinal Lactobacillus casei: construction of an Escherichia coli-Lactobacillus shuttle vector.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pLC494 isolated from Lactobacillus casei L-49 was determined. Plasmid pLC494 is an 8846-bp long circular molecule with a G+C content of 41.5%. Two putative open reading frames, ORF4 (282 amino acids) and ORF5 (169 amino acids), were identified as replication proteins A and B that revealed 100 and 99% similarity, respectively, with the replication proteins of plasmid pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus TK8912. Upstream of ORF4 were the four repeat regions (three perfect 22-bp repeats and one imperfect motif), a putative ribosome binding site, a -10 region, and a -35 region. The shuttle vector pJLE4942 (5318 bp) was constructed using repA from pLC494, a multiple cloning site, ColE1 ori, the ori of gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene from pJIR418 as a selection marker. Transformation of several lactic acid bacteria with the vector pJLE4942 indicated that this vector might be useful as a genetic tool for the intestinal lactobacilli.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
AB  - Six Lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota, L. johnsonii La1, L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and L. rhamnosus GG) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344. All lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this Gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells. By studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and pH control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. The antibacterial activity of L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota and L. rhamnosus GG was solely due to the production of lactic acid. The antibacterial activity of L. johnsonii La1 and L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). The latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. In addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of Salmonella into Caco-2/TC7 cells.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - [Antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. DESIGN: review of literature. SETTING: Charles University at Prague, Pharmaceutical Faculty at Hradec Kralove. METHODS: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. CONCLUSIONS: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. The efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of C. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. Essential oils present in the Cayenne pepper (Capsodum frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans as well. Clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. The effects of Chinese leek are similar to garlic. Propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the yeast strains decreases in the following order: C. albicans > C. tropicalis > C. crusei > C. guilliermondii. Its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. Tea trea oil (Melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of Candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for C. crusei and C. norvengensis. In the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of Lactobacilus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14, B-54 may be recommended. Moreover there are suitable strains of L. brevis CD-2, L. salivarius FV-2, L. gasseri MB 335, L. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (L. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (L. gasseri). The strains of L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with Candida. It should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus (especially L. casei and L. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract. No protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin E, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.
TI  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to human HT29 tissue cell cultures. Effects on adhesion of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. Generally, CGMP exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. The CGMP reduced adhesion of VTEC strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of EPEC strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. The CGMP also reduced the adhesion of L. pentosus and L. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. A slight but significant reduction of L. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either Dsv. desulfuricans or L. gasseri. Further investigation of the dose response relationships with the E. coli strains gave IC50 values ranging between 0.12 and 1.06 mg/mL.
TI  - Rapid identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus by restriction analysis of the  16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and flanking 23S rRNA gene.
AB  - A rapid molecular approach was developed for the initial identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus strains which are difficult to identify using a single biochemical test. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer regions and flanking 23S rRNA genes of 19 strains of lactobacilli were amplified and the nucleotide sequences and restriction site polymorphisms were analyzed. AluI was the most useful of the restriction enzymes analyzed and produced reproducible digestion profiles in the L. helveticus, L. plantarum, and L. casei groups, as well as in L. acidophilus. This restriction fragment length polymorphism method may be useful for the identification of L. acidophilus strains in dairy products.
TI  - Influence of controlled lactic fermentation on growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus in milk.
AB  - The growth and sporulation of Bacillus cereus NVH 45 in a fermentor with controlled pH or simulated pH conditions were investigated. The study was carried out in a fermentor to measure the influence of a rapid and a slow lactic acid production on the inhibition of B. cereus in a controlled environment during the initial part of fermentation and to observe if other factors than lactic acid influenced the inhibition. In the controlled pH experiments the pH was allowed to decrease to an end pH 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0 either by Lactobacillus casei 2756 (a fast acid producer) or Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFB 1748 (a slow acid producer). In co-cultures of Lb. casei 2756 and B. cereus NVH 45, low numbers (10-70 cfu/ml) of B. cereus NVH 45 were observed at end pH 5.5 (72 h) while at pH 5.0 no viable cells (<10 cfu/ml) were detected (48-72 h). B. cereus NVH 45 did not sporulate in co-culture with Lb. casei 2756. In co-culture with Lb. acidophilus NCFB 1748, B. cereus NVH 45 sporulated and survived as spores. In these co-cultures B. cereus NVH 45 grew to higher maximum counts (>10(7) cfu/ml) than with Lb. casei 2756 (<10(7) cfu/ml). Significantly different amounts of lactic acid were observed between the two co-cultures after 7 and 12 h. A rapid decrease of pH appears to prevent B. cereus from sporulating and it seems that it is enough to just reach pH 5.0 rapidly and keep that pH to achieve the desirable inhibition of B. cereus. In the simulated pH experiments B. cereus NVH 45 was inoculated in the fermentor and the different pH developments from different LAB strains were monitored by addition of lactic acid. These experiments showed the same tendency: a fast pH reduction during the initial hours of fermentation, simulating lactococci, resulted in complete inhibition of B. cereus NVH 45 (<10 cfu/ml). However, when simulating the pH development of the two different Lactobacillus strains, complete inhibition of B. cereus NVH 45 was not seen. In co-cultures competition for nutrients with consequences for cell density appears to be important. Based on these results it seems that B. cereus must reach a certain density to induce sporulation.
TI  - Salivary Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. The study population consisted of 297 predominantly African- American women who were pregnant for the first time. The salivary bacterial levels evaluated were Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus sanguinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. RESULTS: For 1 unit increase in log(10) A. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; SE = 29.1; P = 0.04), and a 0.17 week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; SE = 0.09; P = 0.05). In contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) L. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; SE = 19.3; P = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; SE = 0.06; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. These organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial activity is an important characteristic of probiotics. A possible way to achieve this antibacterial activity is through the production of bacteriocins. This study shows that the commercial probiotic strains Lactobacillus johnsonii LA1 and Lactobacillus casei YIT 9029 produce bacteriocins. The nature of the antimicrobial compound could be derived from its behaviour: a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only active against closely related strains), loss of activity when treated with proteinases, and rather small molecular masses (around 6000 Da or less). Further, three bacteriocins produced by Lb. johnsonii LA1, Lb. casei YIT 9029 and Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 showed inhibitory activity against the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. However, a fourth bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB 801 was not able to inhibit H. pylori. This indicates that some bacteriocins produced by specific probiotic strains can fulfil a role in the inhibition of this common pathogen.
TI  - Use of hydrolysates from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) viscera as a complex nitrogen source for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Hydrolysates of cod viscera were tested as an alternative to commonly used complex nitrogen sources (peptones and/or extracts) for the type strains of the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Comparative studies with MRS-like media containing different nitrogen sources showed that all the fish hydrolysates performed equally well or better than commercial extracts/peptones for all selected lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Screening of potential lactobacilli antigenotoxicity by microbial and mammalian cell-based tests.
AB  - Antigenotoxicity is considered an important property for probiotic lactobacilli.  The ability of non probiotic lactobacilli from dairy products and starters to inhibit two reference genotoxins: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was evaluated. The study was carried out using short-term assays with different targets, such as procaryotic cells (SOS-Chromotest for genotoxicity in Escherichia coli and Ames test for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium) and eucaryotic cells (Comet assay for genotoxicity in Caco-2 enterocytes). A high proportion of strains inhibiting 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide activity was found in Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus plantarum. Inhibition of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine activity occurred in only one L. acidophilus strain. All the strains with antigenotoxic properties also demonstrated antimutagenic activity and produced modifications in genotoxin spectroscopic profiles. Strain viability during and after genotoxin exposure was confirmed. Concordance of the results obtained with microbial and mammalian cell-based tests is underlined.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of probiotics microorganisms adhesion to an artificial caries model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study compared the adhesion of two probiotics microorganisms (Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Lactobacillus acidophilus) to an artificial caries model. METHOD: In total, 30 bovine teeth were longitudinally sectioned, excluding the lingual half surface. The specimens were covered with nail varnish, except for an area of 3 by 5 mm in dentin, suspended in an artificial caries solution promoted by Streptococcus mutans, and incubated at 37 degrees C. After 14 days, the specimens were separated equally into two groups and transferred to a brain heart infusion culture media containing L. acidophilus (group A) and L. casei Shirota (group S), at 37 degrees C. After 48 h, the exposed area of dentin was washed with 1 ml of distilled water and the caries dentin was removed and dispersed in 1 ml of saline solution. The samples of distilled water and caries dentin were diluted and inoculated in Rogosa selective Lactobacillus agar. The results in CFU/ml were analysed by the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between Groups A and S for the lactobacilli count in samples of distilled water (P = 0.237). CONCLUSIONS: The amount of L. acidophilus in the artificially caries dentin was significantly superior compared to L. casei Shirota (P = 0.047), suggesting an inferior adhesion potential for this microorganism.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems Optibond FL Primer, Single Bond, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-L-Pop were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined as a positive control material. Disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microL) were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. RESULTS: Of all the materials tested, Optibond FL Primer, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-LPop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Single Bond. The results indicated that Optibond FL Primer had the strongest effect against the S mutans and L casei, and Clearfil SE Bond Primer produced the largest inhibition zone for S salivarius and L acidophilus among the test materials. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Bacteriotherapy and probiotics' role on oral health.
AB  - Oral infections constitute some of the most common and costly forms of infections in humans. The concept of microbial ecological change as a mechanism for preventing dental disease is an important one while altered microbial ecology may lead to dental disease. New methods such as probiotic approaches (i.e. whole bacteria replacement therapy) to eliminate pathogenic members of the microbiota can be investigated. Bacteriotherapy is an alternative and promising way to combat infections by using harmless bacteria to displace pathogenic microorganisms. Probiotics are one of these new agents which are widely used for their therapeutic action. Limited research is available showing that some probiotic cultures may help dental improvement. Present paper focuses on possible oral benefits of probiotics.
TI  - Effects of probiotic bacteria on humoral immunity to Candida albicans in immunodeficient bg/bg-nu/nu and bg/bg-nu/+ mice.
AB  - Germfree beige-nude ( bg/bg-nu/nu) and beige-heterozygous ( bg/bg-nu/+) mice were colonized with a pure culture of Candida albicans or with a probiotic bacterium (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei, or Bifidobacterium infantis). Probiotic-colonized mice were subsequently challenged orally with C. albicans. The effect of prior colonization with probiotic bacteria on the antibody responses of the immunodeficient mice to alimentary tract colonization with C. albicans was compared to the antibody responses of the gnotobiotic mice colonized only with C. albicans. This study demonstrated that, although the probiotic bacteria did not induce a vigorous antibody response to their own antigens, they altered the antibody responses of mice to C. albicans. In T cell competent bg/bg-nu/+mice, B. infantis enhanced and focused IgG1, IgG2A, and IgA responses to C. albicans antigens. Some of the probiotic bacteria also enhanced the IgG1 and IgG2A antibody responses of bg/bg-nu/nu mice to C. albicans antigens. This study not only shows the value of gnotobiotic animal models in demonstrating that probiotic bacteria can affect the capacity of mice to form antibodies to C. albicans, but it also points out their usefulness in comparing the capacity of different probiotic bacteria to produce beneficial health effects in mice.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures on two different yogurt brands over a known population of Staphylococcus aureus and the production of thermonuclease].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. In three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations of S. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) CFU/g and 10(7) CFU/g), respectively. These samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, S. aureus and pH were evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods, Vanderzant & Splittstoesser. The presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for S. aureus from 3M company. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of S. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, S. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. Same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. The presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of S. aureus enterotoxin. This work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with S. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures added to commercial yogurt over a known population of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 during yogurt storage was evaluated. Two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus) were inoculated with known populations (106 UFC/g) of either L. monocytogenes or E. coli O157:H7 in three different times and stored for 32 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, the added pathogens and pH was evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures reduced the population of L. monocytogenes in 8 days, the population of E. coli O157:H7 in 16; yogurt with no additional probiotics took 20 days to reduce L. monocytogenes to non-detectable levels and even after 28 days of storage, E. coli O157:H7 was cultured. In this work, the beneficial effects of additional probiotic cultures in yogurt is confirmed again.
TI  - [Influence of nutritional status on the effectiveness of a dietary supplement of  live lactobacillus to prevent and cure diarrhoea in children].
AB  - The influence of undernutrition on the effectiveness of a dietary supplement of live lactobacillus regarding prevention and treatment of infantile diarrhoea was studied on 200 children 6 to 24m old. Children, undernourished (D) or controls (C), received for 90 days, in a blind experiment, a fermented milk providing L. Acidofilus y L. Casei (10(7)-10(8)/ml) (LB) or an equivalent amount of fluid milk (L). diarrhoea episodes were recorded and classified according duration: 1-4, 5-14 days, and protracted diarrhea (DP) those lasting beyond 14 days. Study requirements were fulfilled by 119 children: D-L: n=25; D-LB: n=32; C-L: n=27 y C-LB: n=35. Preventive aspects were evaluated through number of episodes and through their lasting the therapeutic ones. Episodes recorded were 134: 29 in D-L; 48 in D-LB; 37 in C-L and 20 in C-LB. In the D-LB group over 90% episodes were very short (1-4 days), percentage far higher to that observed in D-L and similar to C-LB. There were 12 episodes of DP, 9 D and 3 in C, all in the L groups. In conclusion, although the fermented milk prevent half episode in the controls but not in the undernourished, it was able to shorter episodes duration and prevent protracted diarrhoea irrespectively of nutritional status. Therefore, undernutrition impaired the ability of the lactobacillus supplement to prevent children diarrhoea, which implicates immune system, but not curative effects which are the result of local actions.
TI  - Antioxidative activity of lactobacilli measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity.
AB  - The reducing ability and antioxidative activity of some species of Lactobacillus  were compared under in vitro conditions. Cultures of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei were grown at 37 degrees C in de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) broth supplemented with 0.5% 2,3,5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) to evaluate reducing activity. Reduced TTC was extracted from the cultures with acetone, and the intensity of the red color measured colorimetrically at 485 nm was an indication of reducing activity. The lactobacilli varied significantly in relative ability to reduce TTC when grown in MRS broth for 15 h. The relative amounts of growth as indicated by pH values at 18 h appeared to influence the amount of reduction. Antioxidative activity was evaluated by the ability of the whole cells or the cell-free extracts from cultures to protect a protein from being attacked by free radicals. These analyses were performed using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity method. All cultures tested exhibited some degree of antioxidative activity. Among the treatments, the cell-free extracts from cells grown in MRS broth exhibited significantly higher values than did whole cells. There was no apparent relationship between the reducing and antioxidative activities of the cultures evaluated. The results from this study show that these cultures can provide a source of dietary antioxidants. Furthermore, selection of cultures that produce antioxidants as starters could provide yet another health or nutritional benefit from cultured or culture-containing dairy products.
TI  - Selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in Tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, Tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin, menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of Clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. These two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli at 100 microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. Structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the C-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.
TI  - Probiotication of tomato juice by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the suitability of tomato juice as a raw material for production of probiotic juice by four lactic acid bacteria (Latobacillus acidophilus LA39, Lactobacillus plantarum C3, Lactobacillus casei A4, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii D7). Tomato juice was inoculated with a 24-h-old culture and incubated at 30 degrees C. Changes in pH, acidity, sugar content, and viable cell counts during fermentation under controlled conditions were measured. The lactic acid cultures reduced the pH to 4.1 or below and increased the acidity to 0.65% or higher, and the viable cell counts (CFU) reached nearly 1.0 to 9.0 x 10(9)/ml after 72 h fermentation. The viable cell counts of the four lactic acid bacteria in the fermented tomato juice ranged from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml after 4 weeks of cold storage at 4 degrees C. Probiotic tomato juice could serve as a health beverage for vegetarians or consumers who are allergic to dairy products.
TI  - Pathogenic relevance of Lactobacillus: a retrospective review of over 200 cases.
AB  - Given that Lactobacillus has been reported to be the causative pathogen in many types of infection despite debate regarding the organism's clinical significance, a literature review was conducted to investigate the treatments and outcomes of Lactobacillus infections reported to date. In this article, the characteristics of over 200 reported cases of Lactobacillus-associated infections are summarized. Lactobacillus was found to be frequently associated with endocarditis and bacteremia. Lactobacillus was also associated with a variety of other infections including, but not limited to, peritonitis, abscesses, and meningitis. The species casei and rhamnosus were the most common. The isolates tended to be most sensitive to erythromycin and clindamycin and most resistant to vancomycin. The species that was most sensitive to vancomycin was acidophilus. The overall mortality rate was nearly 30%. There was a significant association between mortality and polymicrobial infection (P=0.004). In the subset of patients with bacteremia, increased mortality was associated with inadequate treatment (P=0.001) and polymicrobial bacteremia (P=0.044).
TI  - Molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. The results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to S. thermophilus and the species of the L. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that DNA extraction was efficient and that genomic DNA solutions were free of PCR inhibitors. For L. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of PCR quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees C for most of the strains in this species. Real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.
TI  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  - To survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available Lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active Lactobacillus. We incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of API50 CH test kit and RAPID ID 32A kit. Strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei were collected. By agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to Brucella blood agar-MIC plates. Each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin G, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. After incubation, the growth condition of each Brucella blood agar-MIC plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different Lactobacillus products determined. The MICs of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-G to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for L. casei were >32 microg/ml. L. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. According to the MICs of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - Rapid identification of probiotic Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16S rRNA through 23S rRNA.
AB  - This study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic Lactobacillus species such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16S and 23S rRNA genes and their rRNA intergenic spacer region of each species. It was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the general biochemical methods. The phylogenetic analyses, using 16S rDNA sequences of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex PCR assay were trustworthy. Taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven Lactobacillus species.
TI  - [In vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of Candida albicans].
AB  - The adherence of Candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and Escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of Candida albicans. The adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mM, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mM of sucrose, and 500 mM of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in Sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). The presence of other microorganisms, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas E. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
TI  - Role of viability of probiotic strains in their persistence in the gut and in mucosal immune stimulation.
AB  - AIMS: To determine how probiotic bacteria contact with intestinal epithelial and  immune cells and the conditions to induce a good mucosal immune stimulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus casei was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine its interaction with the gut. We compared the influence of viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal mucosal immune system (IMIS) and their persistence in the gut of mice. TEM showed whole Lact. casei adhered to the villi; the bacterial antigen was found in the cytoplasm of the enterocytes. Viable bacteria stimulated the IMIS to a greater extent than nonviable bacteria with the exception of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. For all the strains assayed at 72 h no antigenic particles were found in the intestine. CONCLUSION: Antigenic particles but not the whole bacteria can enter to epithelial cells and contact with the immune cells. Bacterial viability is a condition for a better stimulation of the IMIS. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We demonstrated that only antigenic particle interact with the immune cells and their fast clearance from the gut agrees with those described for the particulate antigens. The regular consumption of probiotics should not adversely affect the host.
TI  - Metabolic activities of Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
AB  - A total of 21 strains of Lactobacillus species were isolated from Turkish kefir samples, in order to select the most suitable strains according to their metabolic activities including probiotic properties. As a result of the identification tests, 21 Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. acidophilus (4%), L. helveticus (9%), L. brevis (9%), L. bulgaricus (14%), L. plantarum (14%), L. casei (19%) and L. lactis (28%). The amount of produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, proteolytic activity, and acetaldehyde productions of Lactobacillus spp. were determined. Different amounts of lactic acid were produced by strains studies; however, lactic acid levels were 1.7-11.4 mg/mL. All strains produced hydrogen peroxide. L. bulgaricus Z14L strain showed no proteolytic activity, L. casei Z6L strain produced the maximum amount (0.16 mg/mL) of proteolytic activity. Acetaldehyde concentration produced in Lactobacillus strains ranged between 0.88-3.52 microg/mL.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of lactobacilli from some traditional fermented foods and evaluation of the bacteriocins.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) commonly used in food as starter cultures are known to produce antimicrobial substances such as bacteriocins and have great potential as food biopreservatives. LAB isolated from traditional fermented foods (appam batter and pickles) were screened for bacteriocin production. Two lactobacilli, LABB and LABP (one from each source) producing bacteriocins were characterized. Both the bacilli were homo-fermentative, catalase negative and micro-aerophilic in nature. LABB was found to be a thermobacterium growing at 45 degrees C while LABP was a streptobacterium growing at 15 degrees C. Both were able to grow at pH 4.5-8.6 but were intolerant to high salt concentration. They failed to produce gas from glucose as well as ammonia from arginine. Among the sugars examined they could not ferment arabinose, raffinose, rhamnose or xylose. Additionally, LABB could not ferment esculin, gluconate or mannose. LABB is identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus while LABP as Lb. casei. Their bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory spectrum against the indicator organisms tested. They were active below pH 8.0 and after autoclaving as well. There was a complete loss of activity when treated with proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin indicating the proteinaceous nature of the active molecules. SDS-PAGE of partially purified bacteriocins indicated the molecular mass of the bacteriocin as 3.8 and 4.5 kDa for LABB and LABP respectively.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacilli and an acidophilic fungus on the production performance and immune responses in broiler chickens.
AB  - Accumulated lines of evidence indicate that inactivated probiotics could have beneficial effects similar to those of live probiotics. Two strains of disrupted, cobalt-enriched, lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and a disrupted fungal mycelium (Scytalidium acidophilum) were spray-mixed onto a mash basal feed, in 2 concentrations, prior to pelleting. The effects of these probiotics on production performance and immune response in broiler chickens were investigated. The production parameters, including BW, feed intake (FI), BW gain (BWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR), were monitored weekly during a 6-wk trial. The immune response was evaluated by immunizing the birds with the antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) followed by a serological assay to measure blood IgA and IgG titers. Some of the production parameters were significantly improved by low L. casei (LCL; for BW and BWG), high L. acidophilus (LAH; for BW and BWG), and high fungal (FH; for BW, BWG, and FI) in comparison with the nonadditive control (NC-). However, these 3 treatments (LCL, LAH, and FH) did not enhance the measured immune responses. Instead, the titers of serum KLH-specific IgA in high L. casei (LCH) and low L. acidophilus (LAL) were significantly higher than those of NC-, 10 d after immunization. None of the probiotic treatments increased the titer of KLH-specific IgG in blood. Our results indicate that disrupted and cobalt-enriched L. acidophilus or L. casei was able to enhance production performance of broiler chickens. The fungal mycelium, S. acidophilum, when used at a high concentration, also demonstrated its potential for the first time to be used as a probiotic. In addition, the optimal concentration for administering probiotics is strain dependent. A higher dose does not always result in a better performance.
TI  - Immunomodulatory and antitumor effects in vivo by the cytoplasmic fraction of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - The immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of lactic acid bacteria (LABs) were investigated. Cytoplasmic fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium longum were tested for the antiproliferative activity in vitro to SNUC2A, SNU1, NIH/3T3 and Jurkat cell lines by crystal violet assay. All cytoplasmic fraction suppressed proliferation of tumor cells, though L. casei and B. longum were more effective. From these results, cytoplasmic fraction of L. casei and B. longum with Y400 as a control were administered as dietary supplements to Balb/c mice for 2, and 4 consecutive wks. Administration for 4 wks enhanced the number of total T cells, NK cells and MHC class II+ cells, and CD4-CD8+ T cells in flow cytometry analysis. To determine of antitumor activity of LABs preparation in vivo, F9 teratocarcinoma cells were inoculated on mice at 14th day. Body weight was decreased with increased survival rate in all groups with the cytoplasm of LABs. Our results showed that cytoplasmic fraction of LABs had direct antiproliferative effects on tumor cell lines in vitro, effects on immune cells in vivo, and antitumor effects on tumor-bearing mice with prolonged survival periods.
TI  - Use of folic acid casei medium reveals trimethoprim susceptibility of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - AIM: Lactobacilli have been reported to have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. The susceptibility of lactobacilli to trimethoprim on different media was investigated in order to search for a phenotypic test method that could indicate the presence of acquired resistance genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum were susceptibility tested with E-tests on folic acid casei medium (FACM), MRS and defined medium 1. The effects of addition or removal of nucleosides and thymidine phosphorylase were investigated. E-tests on FACM yielded reproducible minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for trimethoprim but addition of nucleosides was necessary for growth of Lact. acidophilus. MICs for the tested strains were 0.125-0.19, 0.25-3 and 0.064-0.19 microg ml(-1) for Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum, respectively. With the addition of deoxyuridine and deoxyadenosine to FACM the MICs of Lact. acidophilus were 0.064-1 microg ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactobacilli do not have intrinsic resistance to trimethoprim. The results show that trimethoprim susceptibility testing of the tested Lactobacillus species is possible and indicate that transferable resistance genes are absent in all the tested strains.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Use of group-specific and RAPD-PCR analyses for rapid differentiation of Lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  - The increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. In this study, group-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR analyses were used to identify strains of the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. Group-specific PCR with primers for the L. casei and L. acidophilus groups, as well as L. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 Lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. For identification of these strains to species or strain level, RAPD profiles of the 20 Lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the L. acidophilus and L. casei group. All except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. casei, and L. paracasei. DNA reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the RAPD-PCR.
TI  - Relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. animalis and Enterococcus faecalis. We also determined the number of immunoglobulin (Ig)A+, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha+, interleukin (IL)-6+ and IL-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to BALB/c mice. All strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. No correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. When some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation to liver was observed. The oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1)) and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. The differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. However, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. The ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of IL-6 by IL-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus strains and Saccharomyces boulardii on persistent diarrhea in children.
AB  - The efficacy of probiotics on persistent diarrhea remains uncertain. The purpose  of this study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus sp and Saccharomyces boulardii on persistent diarrhea in children. In a double-blind trial eighty-nine children, aged 6-24 months were randomly distributed to receive pasteurized cow milk containing 2 viable lyophilized strains Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophillus strains CERELA, (10(10)-10(12) colony-forming units per g) (n = 30), or lyophilized S. boulardii, (10(10)-10(12) colony forming units per g) (n = 30) or pasteurized cow milk as placebo (n = 29); on each diet 175 g was given twice a day for a 5 day period. Number of depositions, duration of illness and frequency of vomiting were considered. Enteric pathogens were isolated from stools in 40% of the patients, 27% had rotavirus. Lactobacillus and S. boulardii significantly reduced the number of depositions (p < 0.001) and diarrheal duration (p < 0.005). Similarly both significantly (p < 0.002) reduced vomiting as compared with placebo. There was no difference between treatments depending on rotavirus status. In conclusion, L. casei and L. acidophillus strains CERELA and S. boulardii are useful in the management of persistent diarrhea in children.
TI  - Selective enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and propionibacteria.
AB  - Nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. Bacteriological media evaluated included Streptococcus thermophilus agar, pH modified MRS agar, MRS-vancomycine agar, MRS-bile agar, MRS-NaCl agar, MRS-lithium chloride agar, MRS-NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and L. casei agar. Incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees C for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. S. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h were suitable for S. thermophilus. L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using MRS agar (pH 4.58 or pH 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees C for 72 h. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees C for 72 h were suitable to enumerate L. rhamnosus. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h were selective for L. casei. To estimate the counts of L. casei by subtraction method, counts of L. rhamnosus on MRS-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of L. casei and L. rhamnosus enumerated on MRS-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. L. acidophilus could be enumerated using MRS-agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or Basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or BA-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. Bifidobacteria could be enumerated on MRS-NNLP agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C for 7 to 9 d. A subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. For this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.
TI  - Production of free conjugated linoleic acid by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei of human intestinal origin.
AB  - A gas chromatographic procedure was used for analysis of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers cis-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic; trans-10, cis-12 octadecadienoic; and trans-9, trans-11-octadecadienoic (c9t11, t10c12, t9t11) produced by lactobacilli. Four different cultures, two strains each of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei were tested for their ability to produce CLA from free linoleic acid in MRS broth supplemented with linoleic acid. Different concentrations of linoleic acid (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/ml) were added to MRS broth, inoculated with the lactobacilli, and incubated at 37 degrees C. Viable counts and amounts of individual isomers of CLA (c9t11, t10c12, t9t11) were measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. All the cultures were able to produce free CLA in media supplemented with linoleic acid. Maximum production of CLA (80.14 to 131.63 microg/ml) was observed at 24 h of incubation in broth containing 0.02% of free linoleic acid. No significant (P > 0.05) increases in total CLA levels were observed after 24 h of incubation. The ability of the cultures to produce CLA in skim milk supplemented with 0.02% free linoleic acid also was studied. In this medium, the total amounts of free CLA after 24 h of incubation ranged from 54.31 to 116.53 microg/ml. The use of lactic acid bacteria able to form free CLA in cultured dairy products may have potential health or nutritional benefits. Free CLA in the products likely would be more readily available for absorption from the digestive tract than if it were incorporated into the cells of the starter culture.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in Artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of Artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the Artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active constituents of the Artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides A and B by spectroscopic analysis. In a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B produced a clear inhibitory effect against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bif. breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. casei) and Escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards Bif. bifidum was observed. At 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides A and B exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards Cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards Bact. fragilis and Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides A and B towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of A. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These naturally occurring Artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  - The induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the M cells of Peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. In previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by LAB varied depending upon the strain being studied. Some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (S-IgA). Our aim was to determine the pathway of the internalisation of LAB strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. The presence of LAB on Peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission electron microscopy. Mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. For electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. Histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour after administration of the bacteria. Fluorescent bacteria of L. casei and S. thermophilus were found only in Peyer's patches while L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus were observed in Peyer's patches and in the small intestine. L. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. We confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. We determined that for L. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the M and FAE cells of Peyer's patches, while for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of Peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and L. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. These results suggest that the different effects of LAB on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.
TI  - Inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  - The objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (GIC). This was assessed using an agar diffusion test. Chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to Fuji IX GIC at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. Antibacterial-GIC specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (Streptococcis, Lactobacillus, and Actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. The experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. Control specimens of the GIC produced no bacterial inhibition. The antibacterial-GIC combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. Resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on week 1. CT-GIC showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. The addition of antibacterial agents to Fuji IX creates a GIC material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in SOS-chromotest.
AB  - Antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using SOS-Chromotest. The supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4-NQO on the tester organism Escherichia coli PQ37 (sfiA::lacZ). High genotoxicity inhibition (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: Lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; L. plantarum, 93.3%; L. rhamnosus, 93.4%; L. acidophilus, 90.9%; L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and Bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; Strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in L. casei and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Cell exposure to 100 degrees C for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. The active strains survived at 0.1 mM 4-NQO exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (pH 2.0) and adherence to Caco-2 enterocytes. Antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-NQO absorbance profile.
TI  - Interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  - Health claims of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to stimulate the host immune system. In this study, the antigenic effect of LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of BALB/c mice was evaluated. A dose-dependent increase of the Bcl2 protein was observed with all LAB assayed. Furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that TNFalpha and INFgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from Peyer patches, were enhanced for all the LAB assayed. An important increase of interleukins IL-10 and IL-4 was observed mainly in mice fed with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus casei, while a significant induction of IL-2 and IL-12 was only observed with L. acidophilus (P<0.01). These effects were dose dependent. The role of produced cytokines in the balance Th1/Th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. L. casei, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus enhanced the IgG1 response favouring Th2 balance, while L. acidophilus also increased the IgG2a response inducing Th1 balance. S. thermophilus did not influence the balance Th1/Th2. Our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different adjuvant capacity among them. Thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.
TI  - Assessment of safety of lactobacillus strains based on resistance to host innate  defense mechanisms.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus strains belonging to four species were evaluated for pathogenicity as well as for in vitro sensitivity to the bactericidal mechanisms of macrophages in a rabbit infective endocarditis (IE) model. Two bacteremia-associated strains, L. rhamnosus PHLS A103/70 and L. casei PHLS A357/84, as well as the L. rhamnosus type strain and the probiotic L. rhamnosus strain ATCC 53103, showed moderate infectivity, and the virulence of the probiotic L. casei strain Shirota and type strains such as L. acidophilus ATCC 4356(T) and L. gasseri DSM 20243(T) in the model was negligible. The strains that showed pathogenic potential in the rabbit IE model (PHLS A357/84, PHLS A103/70, and ATCC 53103) were more resistant than strain Shirota to intracellular killing activity by mouse macrophages in vitro and also to bactericidal nitrogen intermediates, such as nitric oxide and NO(2)(-) ions. These results suggest that resistance to host innate defense systems, which would function at inflammatory lesions, should be considered in the safety assessment of Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the S-layer protein crystallisation domain  of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: evidence for protein-protein interaction of two subdomains.
AB  - The structure of the crystallisation domain, SAN, of the S(A)-protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 was analysed by insertion and deletion mutagenesis, and by proteolytic treatment. Mutant S(A)-protein synthesised in Escherichia coli with 7-13 amino acid insertions near the N terminus or within regions of sequence variation in SAN (amino acid position 7, 45, 114, 125, 193), or in the cell wall-binding domain (position 345) could form crystalline sheets, whereas insertions in conserved regions or in regions with predicted secondary structure elements (positions 30, 67, 88 and 156) destroyed this capacity. FACscan analysis of L.acidophilus synthesising three crystallising and one non-crystallising S(A)-protein c-myc (19 amino acid residues) insertion mutant was performed with c-myc antibodies. Fluorescence was most pronounced for insertions at positions 125 and 156, less for position 45 and severely reduced for position 7. By cytometric flow sorting a transformant harbouring the mutant S(A)-protein gene (position 125) was isolated that showed an increased fluorescense signal. Immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that the transformant synthesized mutant S(A)-protein only. PCR analysis of the transformant grown in the absence of selection pressure indicated that the mutant allele was stably integrated in the chromosome. Proteolytic treatment of S(A)-protein indicated that only sites near the middle of SAN are susceptible, although potential cleavage sites are present through the entire molecule. Expression in E.coli of DNA sequences encoding the two halves of SAN yielded peptides that could oligomerize. Our results indicate that SAN consists of a approximately 12kDa N and a approximately 18kDa C-terminal subdomain linked by a surface exposed loop. The capacity of S(A)-protein of L.acidophilus to present epitopes, up to approximately 19 amino acid residues in length, at the bacterial surface in a genetically stable form, makes the system, in principle, suitable for application as an oral delivery vehicle.
TI  - Probiotics and Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - The need for new strategies for Helicobacter pylori eradication, alternative or complementary to antibiotic therapy, has recently claimed the attention of many investigators. Pre-clinical studies have shown the inhibition of Helicobacter pylori growth by Lactobacilli and the anti-Helicobacter pylori action of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus strains, possibly due to the production of lactic acid or to the secretion of an autolysin. Clinical studies have demonstrated a persistent reduction in delta over baseline values at the 13C urea breath test independently of omeprazole administration with Lactobacillus acidophilus La1, the eradication in 6 out of 14 patients with Lactobacillus acidophilus alone, positive results in patients in which a standard Helicobacter pylori triple therapy was randomly supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Probiotics--a therapy in search of a disease.
AB  
TI  - [The nutritional status change the effectiveness of a dietary supplement of lactic bacteria on the emerging of respiratory tract diseases in children].
AB  - One hundred children 6 to 24 month old, normal or undernourished according to weight for height index, received during three months--autumn to winter--a dietary supplement of live Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus Casei, 10(7)-10(8)/ml in fermented milk (LB) or an equivalent amount of fluid milk (L) as control. Children's follow-up was performed as outpatients in the Hospital Posadas (Great Buenos Aires). Episodes of respiratory tract infections were recorded and classified according to severity as: Pneumonia (N); Bronchitis (B), Recurrent Obstructive Bronchitis (BOR) and upper respiratory tract infections (CVAS). 58% of children fitted the study protocol, 22 in the LB and 36 in the L group; 21 were undernourished and 37 presented normal weight/height. No deaths were recorded. Total episodes were 103: 34 in LB and 69 in L, that means a frequency of 1.55 and 1.92 episodes/children respectively. In LB a maximum of 3 episodes/children was recorded, meanwhile the number reached 7 in L (p = 0.0373). Severity was higher in L than LB: 0.06 vs. 0 for N; 0.69 vs. 0.45 for B + BOR and 1.17 vs. 1.09 for CVAS. In the control group frequency of severe pathologies was about twice in undernourished than in normal: 0.08 vs. 0.04 for N; 1.08 vs. 0.50 for B + BOR; no difference was found for CVAS. Live lactobacillus supplement suppressed pneumonia and decreased bronchitis in undernourished as well as in normal. In this study undernutrition not only increased the chance of suffering severe acute respiratory tract infections but also impaired the effectiveness of the supplement to decrease severity. The effect is explained on the basis of the immunocompetence depression linked to an inadequate nutritional status.
TI  - Species-specific identification of commercial probiotic strains.
AB  - Products containing probiotic bacteria are gaining popularity, increasing the importance of their accurate speciation. Unfortunately, studies have suggested that improper labeling of probiotic species is common in commercial products. Species identification of a bank of commercial probiotic strains was attempted using partial 16S rDNA sequencing, carbohydrate fermentation analysis, and cellular fatty acid methyl ester analysis. Results from partial 16S rDNA sequencing indicated discrepancies between species designations for 26 out of 58 strains tested, including two ATCC Lactobacillus strains. When considering only the commercial strains obtained directly from the manufacturers, 14 of 29 strains carried species designations different from those obtained by partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Strains from six commercial products were species not listed on the label. The discrepancies mainly occurred in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei groups. Carbohydrate fermentation analysis was not sensitive enough to identify species within the L. acidophilus group. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis was found to be variable and inaccurate and is not recommended to identify probiotic lactobacilli.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  - The influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or Bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. During incubation and first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in CT (Streptococcus thermophilus/Lb. casei), AT (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus) and ABT fermented milks (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus/Bifid. bifidum). Levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. Through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. However, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in AT and ABT products but not in CT fermented milks. Through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by Lb. acidophilus in AT products whereas the presence of Bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in ABT fermented milks. Glucose remained constant, with minor variations in CT products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated AT and ABT fermented milks during storage. Beta-galactosidase activity displayed by Str. thermophilus strains was similar at pH 6.5 (initial pH of non-carbonated samples) and pH 6.3 (initial pH of carbonated samples) whereas Lb. acidophilus LaA3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at pH 6.3 than at higher pH values. Thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of Lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial pH of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in AT and ABT fermented milks through the refrigerated period. In CT fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of Str. thermophilus at pH 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in Lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus strains (L. casei and L. Acidophillus Strains cerela) on  bacterial overgrowth-related chronic diarrhea.
AB  - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth and related diarrhea is a condition that frequently accompanies anatomic disorders, surgically created blind loops or strictures with partial small bowel obstruction and although it is often controlled with antimicrobial therapy, alternative treatment may be needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an oral probiotic preparation of 2 viable lyophilized strains of lactobacilli (1.5 g each) compared with placebo. Twenty two patients with proven overgrowth and chronic diarrhea are described. In random order and double-blind fashion, 2 groups of patients received identical capsules with both Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophillus strains CERELA (12 patients) (LC) and placebo (10 patients) (P) during three consecutive periods of 7 days each followed by a similar three periods of control after withdrawal. At the end of each period the mean daily number of stools, glucose breath H2 test, and symptoms were considered. Lactobacillus were investigated in feces in both groups at day 0 (baseline), on day 21 of treatment with LC and P and on day 21 after withdrawal. Compared with P a significant reduction in mean daily number of stools was achieved with LC (p < 0.005) at 15 days, and (p < 0.0005) at 21 days and the effect was sustained at 7 days and 15 days (p < 0.005) after withdrawal. With respect to breath H2 level a significant decrease in H2 concentration was noted at 7 days (p < 0.005) at 15 days, and 21 days (p < 0.0001) with LC and only a significant decrease (p < 0.005) was observed at 7 days after withdrawal. No significant changes were observed with respect to symptoms. The Lactobacillus CERELA strains were isolated from the feces in all patients LC (n = 12) on day 21, and by contrast no Lactobacillus were observed except in two patients out of seven patients after withdrawal. In summary, this study provides evidence that LC are effective for treatment of bacterial overgrowth--related chronic diarrhea, and suggest that probiotics must be used with continuity.
TI  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.
TI  - Lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. Alternative treatment methods to control H. pylori infection are needed. Some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of H. pylori in vitro. A clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of H. pylori. METHOD: The yogurt was prepared using three Lactobacillus spp. (L. acidophilus and L. casei) and one commercial starter culture (L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). All these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory effects on the growth of H. pylori. Twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for H. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13C urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. The 13C urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of H. pylori. RESULTS: In 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of H. pylori. CONCLUSION: Although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of H. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.
TI  - Effect of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and inulin on the formation of aberrant crypt foci in rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our studies were aimed at investigating the effect of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) or inulin, a natural source of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from chicory, on the induction by carcinogens of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon, which are considered to be early precursor lesions of neoplasia. METHODS: Strains of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus were administered to rats fed a purified high starch diet, under a variety of treatment protocols including daily gavage, via the drinking water and in the diet. The rats were treated with methyl-N-nitrosourea, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, or azoxymethane (AOM) to induce ACF. RESULTS: In general, no consistent significant changes in ACF numbers were detected in these experiments. In one study, the basal diet of the rats was changed to one containing a higher level of fat (corn oil). Under these conditions, a significant decrease in AOM-induced colonic ACF was seen in rats given L. acidophilus or inulin. In a concurrent group of animals fed a low fat diet, no significant decrease in ACF was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the type of diet fed can influence the detection of protective effects of LAB and oligosaccharides and that against the background of a diet with a level of fat typical of a Western diet, evidence for a protective effect of L. acidophilus and inulin towards colon cancer was obtained
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - Evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  - The development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS. Their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Inhibition of in vitro growth of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 by probiotic Lactobacillus strains due to production of lactic acid.
AB  - The inhibiting characteristics of lactic acid bacteria on Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 (three strains, clinically isolated) was investigated by using a batch fermentation system. The species such as Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota or L. acidophilus YIT 0070 exert growth inhibitory and bactericidal activities on STEC. The pH value and undissociated lactic acid (U-LA) concentration of the culture medium of STEC cocultured with L. casei or L. acidophilus dramatically lowered or increased, respectively [corrected], when compared with those of the control culture. The cytotoxic properties of U-LA on STEC strain 89020087 analyzed in vitro was divided into two phases, i.e., the bacteriostatic phase (between 3.2 to 62 mM) and the bactericidal phase (over 62 mM). These data suggest that the bactericidal effect of Lactobacillus on STEC depends on its lactic acid production and pH reductive effect.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus casei group and the Lactobacillus acidophilus group by automated ribotyping.
AB  - A total of 91 type and reference strains of the Lactobacillus casei group and the L acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device Riboprinter microbial characterization system. The L. casei group was divided into five (C1-C5) genotypes by ribotyping. Among them, the strain of L. casei ATCC 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of L. paracasei strains and L casei JCM 1134T generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of L. zeae. These results supported the designation of L. casei ATCC 334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of L. casei JCM 1134T as L. zeae. The L. acidophilus group was also divided into 14 (A1-A11, B1-B3) genotypes by ribotyping. L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus and L. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by L. gasseri and L. johnsonii. This result confirmed previous data that the L. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. Five strains of L. acidophilus and two strains of L. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. Most strains belonging to the L. casei group and the L. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. Thus this RiboPrinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible genetic information for the identification of many strains.
TI  - Characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and cheese from northwest Argentina.
AB  - Indigenous lactic acid bacteria in ewe's milk and artisanal cheese were studied in four samples of fresh raw milk and four 1-month-old cheeses from the provinces of northwest Argentina. Mean growth counts on M17, MRS, and MSE agar media did not show significant differences (P < 0.05) in raw milk and cheeses. Isolates of lactic acid bacteria from milk were identified as Enterococcus (48%), lactococci (14%), leuconostocs (8%), and lactobacilli (30%). All lactococci were identified as Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and subsp. cremoris). Lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (92%) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (8%). Enterococci (59%) and lactobacilli (41%) were isolated from cheeses. L. plantarum (93%), L. acidophilus (5%), and Lactobacillus casei (2%) were most frequently isolated. L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis strains were considered as fast acid producers. L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains were slow acid producers. L. plantarum and L. casei strains identified from the cheeses showed slow acid production. The majority of the lactobacilli and Lactococcus lactis strains utilized citrate and produced diacetyl and acetoin in milk. Enzyme activities (API-ZYM tests) of lactococci were low, but activities of L. plantarum strains were considerably higher. The predominance of L. plantarum in artisanal cheese is probably important in the ripening of these cheeses due to their physiological and biochemical characteristics.
TI  - Thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  - This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins B(1), B(2) and B(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. Our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the B-vitamin (B(1), B(2), B(6)) status of the healthy adult human. METHODS: The test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with Lactobacillus casei GG. Different chemical forms of all investigated B-vitamins were determined by HPLC methods. In order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( = 500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. RESULTS: The heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. The plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. A similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. The plasma levels of the B(2)-vitamers were different. The flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the subjects received the untreated yoghurt. In contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. The free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. The concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. However, the differences were not significant. The excretion of thiamin, B(2)- and B(6)-vitamers in the faeces did not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin B(1), B(2) and B(6) status of man. It seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin B consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. Obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.
TI  - Adherence of probiotic bacteria to human intestinal mucus in healthy infants and  during rotavirus infection.
AB  - The concentration of fecal mucin and the adhesion of specific probiotics and their combinations in the intestinal mucus of infants during and after rotavirus diarrhea and in healthy children were determined. Mucus was prepared from fecal samples from 20 infants during and after rotavirus diarrhea and from 10 healthy age-matched children. Mucin concentration was determined, and the adhesion of five probiotics-Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Lactobacillus paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5, and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12-and their combinations was tested in vitro. The mean concentrations of fecal mucin during and after rotavirus diarrhea, 15.2 and 14.1 mg/g, were comparable to that in healthy children, 14.9 mg/g. The adherence of probiotics ranged from 1 to 34% in healthy subjects as indicated for the following strains: L. rhamnosus GG, 34%; B. lactis Bb12, 31%; L. acidophilus LA5, 4%; L. paracasei F19, 3%; and L. casei Shirota, 1% (P = 0.0001). The distinctive pattern of probiotic adherence was not influenced by rotavirus diarrhea. The adhesion of Bb12 in the presence of GG increased from 31 to 39% in healthy infants (P = 0.018) and in episodes of diarrhea increased from 26 to 44% (P = 0.001). Rotavirus diarrhea does not decrease the production of fecal mucin or with respect to the adhesion of probiotic bacteria tested in vitro. Combination of specific probiotic strains may enhance adherence in a synergistic manner. Optimal clinical application of these interactions may offer novel therapeutic guidelines for the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal infections.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Molecular discrimination of lactobacilli used as starter and probiotic cultures by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and L. casei related taxa which are widely used as starter or probiotic cultures can be identified by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The genetic discrimination of the related species belonging to these groups was first obtained by PCR amplifications by using group-specific or species-specific 16S rDNA primers. The numerical analysis of the ARDRA patterns obtained by using CfoI, HinfI, Tru9I, and ScrFI was an efficient typing tool for identification of species of the L. acidophilus and L. casei complex. ARDRA by using CfoI was a reliable method for differentiation of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis. Finally, strains ATCC 393 and ATCC 15820 exhibited unique ARDRA patterns with CfoI and Tru9I restriction enzymes as compared with the other strains of L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. rhamnosus.
TI  - Reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  - Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the US. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. We studied the efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium and a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by sheep experimentally infected with the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. Following oral inoculation with 10(10)CFU of E. coli O157:H7, 30 Suffolk ram lambs were blocked by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. The lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with L. acidophilus or with S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus and S. faecium or with a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum. The microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)CFU per kilogram of diet. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for E. coli O157:H7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC) as a selective media. E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by its reaction with O157 and H7 antisera. E. coli O157:H7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. However, lambs administered a mixture of L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum shed significantly lower (P=0.0211) average number of E. coli O157:H7 (2.3log(10)CFU per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. S. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (P=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of L. acidophulus and S. faecium in fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)CFU per gram of feces) but significantly lower (P=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)CFU per gram of feces) and those supplemented with L. acidophilus (5.5log(10)CFU per gram of feces). Average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) were significantly improved (P=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for L. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for S. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for L. acidophulus and S. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for L. acidophilus, S. faecium, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum supplemented lambs. The study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with E. coli O157:H7 with S. faecium or a mixture of S. faecium, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum and L. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of E. coli O157:H7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.
TI  - Taxonomy and important features of probiotic microorganisms in food and nutrition.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are among the most important probiotic microorganisms typically associated with the human gastrointestinal tract. Traditionally, lactic acid bacteria have been classified on the basis of phenotypic properties, eg, morphology, mode of glucose fermentation, growth at different temperatures, lactic acid configuration, and fermentation of various carbohydrates. Studies based on comparative 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analysis, however, showed that some taxa generated on the basis of phenotypic features do not correspond with the suggested phylogenetic relations. Thus, some species are not readily distinguishable by phenotypic characteristics. This is especially true for the so-called Lactobacillus acidophilus group, the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus paracasei group, and some bifidobacteria, strains of which have been introduced in many probiotic foods, eg, the novel yogurt-like commodities. Consequently, modern molecular techniques, including polymerase chain reaction-based and other genotyping methods, have become increasingly important for species identification or for the differentiation of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains are selected for potential application on the basis of particular physiologic and functional properties, some of which may be determined in vitro. The classification and identification of a probiotic strain may give a strong indication of its typical habitat and origin. The species, or even genus name, may also indicate the strain's safety and technical applicability for use in probiotic products. Molecular typing methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, repetitive polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length polymorphism are extremely valuable for specific characterization and detection of such strains selected for application as probiotics.
TI  - The S-layer protein of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for S-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (S(A)-protein) of 43 kDa. S(A)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. Reconstruction of the S-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 A; b=53 A, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the S-layer of Lactobacillus helveticus ATCC 12046. Sequence comparison of S(A)-protein with S-proteins from L. helveticus, Lactobacillus crispatus and the S-proteins encoded by the silent S-protein genes from L. acidophilus and L. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the N-terminal two-thirds (SAN), and another made up of the C-terminal one-third (SAC) of S(A)-protein. The sequence of the N-terminal domains is variable, while that of the C-terminal domain is highly conserved in the S-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. Proteolytic digestion of S(A)-protein showed that SAN was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. SAC was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. DNA sequences encoding SAN or Green Fluorescent Protein fused to SAC (GFP-SAC) were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified SAN could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic S(A)-protein. A calculated S(A)-protein minus SAN density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the SAC domain, which is missing from the truncated SAN peptide. The GFP-SAC fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of L. acidophilus, L. helveticus and L. crispatus cells from which the S-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped cells or to Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  - Mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. The incidence of AAD differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. The major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with Clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all AAD. In most cases of AAD discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower AAD risk can be effective. For more severe cases involving C. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. Another approach to AAD treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. Several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of AAD such as selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. Another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii has been used. In animal models of C. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with S. boulardii (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in C. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin B production. In several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), S. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of C. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins A and B of C. difficile. It has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of C. difficile colitis. A good response has been seen in children with AAD, treated by S. boulardii only. In ICUs prevention of AAD remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of C. difficile or other agents of AAD should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). In addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as S. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. AAD in at risk patients.
TI  - Fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. METHODS: The antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and cetylpyridinium chloride. Two organisms each belonging to Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. A checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (FIC) and summation operator FIC index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. Appropriate controls were included. The summation operator FIC index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. RESULTS: The data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. Using summation operator FIC values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by The American Society for Microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. However, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. Nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. CONCLUSIONS: According to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. However, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.
TI  - Chemical, physical and enzymatic pre-treatments of probiotic lactobacilli alter their adhesion to human intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  - Intestinal mucus glycoproteins extracted from faeces of healthy adult subjects were used as a substratum for bacterial adhesion to investigate the effects of physical, chemical and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria on their adhesion. The strains studied were Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 (LCI, Nestle), L. rhamnosus strain GG (ATCC 53103), L. rhamnosus LC-705, and L. casei strain Shirota (Yakult, Yakult Ltd). Hereafter the strains are referred to as LA1, LGG, LC-705, and Shirota, respectively. Strains LA1 and LGG adhered greatly whereas the adhesion of strains LC-705 and Shirota to intestinal mucus glycoproteins was low. Adhesion of LA1 and LGG was reduced by boiling, autoclaving and by pepsin and trypsin treatments suggesting that the bacterial protein structures are essential for their adhesion. Treatment in ethanol and in propanol prior to adhesion significantly increased the adhesion of LA1 and LC-705, respectively. Adhesion of Shirota strain was not altered by any of the treatments.
TI  - Viability of probiotic (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in Argentinian Fresco cheese.
AB  - We evaluated the suitability of Argentinian Fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. We used cultures of Bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), Bifidobacterium longum (two strains), Bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), Lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and Lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. Probiotic, lactic starter (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. Furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (pH 2 and 3) of Fresco cheese. The results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. Both combinations of bifidobacteria and L. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for L. casei). On the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, L. acidophilus, and L. casei tested adapted well to the Fresco cheese environment. When a cheese homogenate at pH 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. At pH 2, the cell viability was more affected; B. bifidum was the most resistant organism. This study showed that the Argentinian Fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Development of a chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal system for Lactobacillus acidophilus with thyA gene as selective marker.
AB  - A chromosome-plasmid balanced lethal gene delivery system for Lactobacillus acidophilus based on the thyA gene was developed. The selected L. acidophilus DOM La strain carries a mutated thyA gene and has an obligate requirement for thymidine. This strain can be used as a host for the constructed shuttle vector pFXL03, lacking antibiotic-resistant markers but having the wild-type thyA gene from L. casei which complements the thyA chromosomal mutation. The vector also contains the replicon region from plasmid pUC19 and that of the Lactococcus plasmid pWV01, which allows the transfer between Escherichia coli, L. casei and L. acidophilus. Eight unique restriction sites (i.e., PstI, HindIII, SphI, SalI, AccI, XbaI, KpnI and SacI) are available for cloning. After 40-time transfers in modified MRS medium, no plasmid loss was observed. The vector pFXL03 is potentially useful as a food-grade vaccine delivery system for L. acidophilus.
TI  - Cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris against Clostridium spp.
AB  - The growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of Cordyceps militaris Link. Pt. (Ascomycotina: Clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of Coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. The biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. This compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward Clostridium paraputrificum and Clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and Escherichia coli. However, C. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of C. militaris. As a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
TI  - Probiotic effects of feeding heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei to Candida albicans-colonized immunodeficient mice.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria can protect immunodeficient mice from orogastric candidiasis but cause some pathology of their own. Severely immunodeficient patients may be at risk if fed viable probiotics, so this study evaluated the probiotic potential of nonviable probiotic bacteria to protect immunodeficient mice from Candida albicans infections. Heat-killed probiotic bacteria were fed to gnotobiotic bg/bg-nu/nu and bg/bg-nu/+ mice to ascertain if they could protect the mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Both heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus (HKLA) and heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (HKLC), in comparison to control mice not fed the probiotic bacteria but challenged (oral) with C. albicans, suppressed the severity of orogastric candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice at 2 weeks after colonization with C. albicans, inhibited disseminated candidiasis in C. albicans-colonized bg/bg-nu/+ mice at 4 weeks after colonization, and suppressed the number of viable C. albicans in the alimentary tract. HKLA, but not HKLC, treatment inhibited disseminated candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice at 2 weeks after oral challenge and enhanced the proliferative responses of splenocytes from C. albicans-colonized bg/bg-nu/+ mice to C. albicans antigens. Neither HKLA nor HKLC were able to prolong the survival of gnotobiotic bg/bg-nu/nu mice after oral challenge with C. albicans. These results demonstrate that heat-killed lactobacilli can induce some (limited) protection (probiotic effect) against candidiasis in mice.
TI  - [Cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The possibility of using the genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. The prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mRNA, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). To prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. High copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in L. plantarum and L. pentosus strains. Several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. Genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. The vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum and L. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. But the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. L. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. In addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.
TI  - Probiotic bacteria: selective enumeration and survival in dairy foods.
AB  - A number of health benefits have been claimed for probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and Lactobacillus casei. Because of the potential health benefits, these organisms are increasingly incorporated into dairy foods. However, studies have shown low viability of probiotics in market preparations. In order to assess viability of probiotic bacteria, it is important to have a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria. Viability of probiotic bacteria is important in order to provide health benefits. Viability of probiotic bacteria can be improved by appropriate selection of acid and bile resistant strains, use of oxygen impermeable containers, two-step fermentation, micro-encapsulation, stress adaptation, incorporation of micronutrients such as peptides and amino acids and by sonication of yogurt bacteria. This review will cover selective enumeration and survival of probiotic bacteria in dairy foods.
TI  - Effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  - We reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. Of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. The most widely studied probiotic bacteria were Lactobacillus GG (22 studies), Lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), Bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and Enterococcus faecium (7 studies). Intake of Lactobacillus GG consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. However, evidence for the prevention by Lactobacillus GG and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. Effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. Cholesterol lowering by L. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by E. faecium seems to be transient. Two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with Lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. The production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. In conclusion, consumption of foods containing Lactobacillus GG may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. Other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. Well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. Based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. Specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. helveticus, L. reuteri, and Streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. A similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and Peyer's patch cells. Both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) IL-6, and NO. Pronounced enhancement of IL-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. Based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and NO, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.
TI  - Study of adhesion of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 to ileal intestinal cells of mice.
AB  - It is well known that the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, a strain present in probiotics, presents lectinlike surface molecules. Presence of these molecules stimulates the immune system. Given the role that lectins and lectinlike substances play in the adhesion phenomenon, it is probable that this is an initial stage in the immunostimulation produced by this bacterium. To confirm this, adhesion of this microorganism to exfoliated mouse ileal epithelial cells was studied in vitro. Other L. casei strains isolated from adult human intestines and one of dairy origin were also examined for their ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells. Another strain, which was included in the present study, was Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 730. L. casei strains isolated from humans showed good ability to adhere to ileal epithelial cells, whereas L. casei isolated from dairy origin did not. Adhesion was only observed at 37 degrees C and at a pH between 6 and 7.5. The exposure time needed for highest adhesion was 30 min. Presence of lectinlike substances on the surface of L. casei CRL 431 is important to this adhesion phenomenon, since adherence capacity was lost after removal of these substances.
TI  - Growth-inhibiting effects of Coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibiting activity of Coptis japonica (Makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (BS), berberine iodide (BI), palmatine chloride (PC), and palmatine sulfate(PS)], as well as that of Thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The biologically active constituents of the Coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (BC), palmatine iodide (PI), and coptisine chloride (CC) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. In a test using 500 microg/disk, BC and PI produced a clear inhibitory effect against Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli. At 1000 microg/ disk, CC revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas EGCG exhibited weak growth inhibition against only C. perfringens and C. paraputrificum. Among various isoquinoline alkaloids, BC exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward C. perfringens than BI and BS, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in PI compared to PC and PS. The Coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of B. longum and C. perfringens.
TI  - The effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
AB  - Four common Lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. Mice received perorally 10(9) viable bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. Lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and B-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (by 27-28%). Conversely, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation, particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin A (by 43-68%) and LPS (by 23-62%). Therefore, these Lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on B- and T-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.
TI  - In vitro adhesion to enamel and in vivo colonization of tooth surfaces by Lactobacilli from a bio-yoghurt.
AB  
TI  - Antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). They were identified as L. plantarum (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (1 strain), L. brevis (2 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. casei (1 strain), L. fermentum (1 strain) and L. acidophilus (1 strain). Bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with L. fermentum, L. delbrueckii and L. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. The bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using Enterococcus faecalis as indicator. While catalase treatment, pH changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees C had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase K resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. A reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Isolation and identification of lactobacilli from novel-type probiotic and mild yoghurts and their stability during refrigerated storage.
AB  - A total of 26 Lactobacillus strains were isolated from various mild yoghurts and  novel-type probiotic dairy products and from a starter culture preparation and were identified by using DNA-DNA hybridization technique. The species present in those products were found to be Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus. DNA homology analysis revealed that some strains had been misclassified by their investigators. Three strains designated as L. acidophilus (L. acidophilus LA-1, L. acidophilus ATCC 43121 and the Lactobacillus strain from Biogarde culture) were found to belong to L. johnsonii and L. acidophilus L1 to be L. crispatus. Strains designated as L. casei were found to be members of three separate species: L. casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus. Viable numbers of lactobacilli in mild and probiotic yoghurts varied greatly including some products with very low Lactobacillus counts. The majority of the probiotic yoghurts, however, contained viable counts above 10(5) per g even at the end of the best before use period.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria ingestion of basal cytokine mRNA and immunoglobulin levels in the mouse.
AB  - An increasing number of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations containing lactic acid bacteria are being promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes remain undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that basal gastrointestinal immune status in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of repeated oral exposure to viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in mice on basal cytokine mRNA expression in mucosal (Peyer's patches), systemic (spleen), and lymphoid tissue and on immunoglobulin levels. The results indicated that oral exposure to 10(9) CFU/day for up to 14 days did not significantly affect basal interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or interleukin-6 mRNA expression or total serum and intestinal immunoglobulins.
TI  - Ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  - Increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. Mice were gavaged with 1 X 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, Peyer's patch and splenic leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. These were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. The results revealed that Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei potentiated IL-6 and IL-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas L. acidophilus upregulated IFN-gamma and nitric oxide. In contrast, L. helveticus, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and Bifidobacterium attenuated the production of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. TNF-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. None of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric oxide by Peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. Taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from Spirulina platensis.
AB  - Spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. Some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, MRS and RM, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of Spirulina platensis in Zarrouk medium. In both MRS and RM media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic acid bacteria assayed. This stimulatory effect was observed in media with pH adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. No effect was observed in minimal saline medium.
TI  - Increased growth of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. GBF improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate. In this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. Daily administration of 9 g GBF for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. Fecal Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium were also significantly increased by GBF administration in healthy volunteers. Ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing GBF as a sole carbon source (GBF medium). After a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Bacteroides ovatus, Clostridium butyricum, and Eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium pH producing SCFA. Eubacterium grown together with Bifidobacterium in GBF medium efficiently produced butyrate. On the other hand, GBF changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as Bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. As a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium. This butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Lactic acid-mediated suppression of Helicobacter pylori by the oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius as a probiotic in a gnotobiotic murine model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined whether or not the lactobacilli administered to treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can suppress the colonization of H. pylori, and we also sought to elucidate the mechanism of such suppression. METHODS: We used an in vitro culture system and an H. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. RESULTS: Among the lactobacillus species examined in vitro, Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) but not L. casei or L. acidophilus proved to be capable of producing a high amount of lactic acid and thus completely inhibiting the growth of H. pylori in a mixed culture. The validity of L. salivarius as a probiotic to suppress H. pylori and thus reduce the inflammatory response was again confirmed in vivo by using an H. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, L. salivarius was found to be a potentially effective probiotic against H. pylori.
TI  - 16S-23S and 23S-5S intergenic spacer regions of lactobacilli: nucleotide sequence, secondary structure and comparative analysis.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in several cases their identification was, and still is, neither easy nor reliable. The aim of the present work was to examine whether the intergenic spacer regions could be of value in the identification of Lactobacillus species. For that purpose, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify 16S-23S and 23S-5S spacer regions of Lactobacillus (L.) acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. helveticus and L. curvatus. The PCR products were directly sequenced, and two forms of ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons were identified in each species studied: one with tandem tRNA(Ile)/tRNA(Ala) genes and the other one without tRNA genes. Our study revealed that the rrn operons of Lactobacillus species studied comprise the genes of 16S, 23S and 5S rRNA, in that order. Only the tRNA genes and the rRNA processing stems are highly conserved in spacer regions of lactobacilli. The divergence between the lactobacilli spacer region sequences arises from insertions and deletions of short sequences. These sequences could be interesting candidates for the development of species-specific probes. Theoretical RNA/RNA secondary structure models of the interaction between the two spacer region sequences were constructed. In conclusion, the two spacer region sequences may prove to be a useful alternative to 16S and 23S rDNA sequencing for designing species-specific probes and for establishing phylogenetic relationships between closely related species such as L. curvatus and L. casei or L. acidophilus and L. helveticus.
TI  - Bile salt deconjugation and cholesterol removal from media by Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei N19 and E5 and Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 and ATCC 43121 were compared for their ability to deconjugate bile salts and remove cholesterol from MRS broth during growth at pH 6.0 and during growth without pH control. Samples grown without pH control dropped to pH 4.2 to 4.5 during 20 h of incubation, depending on the culture. The plate counts indicated that populations in all cultures were near their maximum numbers after 16 h of growth. The amount of cholesterol removed from the broth was similar for both strains of L. acidophilus grown with and without pH control. However, the strains of L. casei differed significantly in the amount of cholesterol removed during growth with or without pH control. Both cultures of L. casei that were grown at pH 6.0 removed very little cholesterol from the broth, but cells grown without pH control removed up to 60 micrograms of cholesterol/ml. All cultures of both species deconjugated 60 to 90% of the bile salts. Lactobacillus acidophilus L1 was the only culture to demonstrate differences between the two pH treatments in the amount of bile salts deconjugated; however, there was no difference in the amounts of cholesterol removed. These results indicate that most of the cholesterol removal from broth by L. acidophilus was due to assimilation, perhaps by the incorporation of cholesterol into the cellular membrane. Lactobacillus casei most likely removes cholesterol from broth by means of the destabilization of cholesterol micelles and the coprecipitation of the cholesterol with the deconjugated bile salts at pH less than 6.0.
TI  - Study of the morphology of the cell walls of some strains of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to find an explanation for the biological  effect of the bacteria present in a biotherapeutic milk (Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 and Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 730). The ability of bacterial cell walls to induce an immune response when introduced into an organism is well known. In this paper we specifically analyzed the morphology of these cell walls. Besides the two bacterial strains used in the fermented milk, two other lactic acid bacteria, belonging to another genus and unable to induce an immune system response, as well as a strain of Propionibacterium, of which the immune modulating capacity is known, were used in this work. We found a structural particularly in strains with immunostimulating capacity (L. casei CRL 431 and P. acidopropionici CRL 1198): molecules which protrude from the cell surface. In L. casei CRL 431 these molecules were identified as lectins because they are able to agglutinate yeast cells treated with glutaraldehyde and glycine. The structures protruding from P. acidipropionici CRL 1198 cells were teichoic acids. Teichoic acid and lectin-like structures can participate in adhesion to intestinal cells. The immunostimulation observed can be induced by the adhesion phenomenon.
TI  - Taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus. The physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. In total, 176 strains, including the type strains, have been included. Phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic proteins. Genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization for bifidobacteria. In the genus Lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: L. acidophilus group, L. casei group and L. reuteri/L. fermentum group. Most strains referred to as L. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as L. gasseri or as L. johnsonii, both members of the L. acidophilus group. A similar situation could be shown in the L. casei group, where most of the strains named L. casei belonged to L. paracasei subspp. A recent proposal to reject the species L. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species L. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. Bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. According to phenotypic features and confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to B. animalis, although they were often declared as B. longum by the manufacturer. From the genus Enterococcus, probiotic Ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the vanA-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. These unwanted resistances could be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kDa resistance protein. In conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus Species by Molecular Typing.
AB  - A total of 64 type, reference, clinical, health food, and stock isolates of microaerophilic Lactobacillus species were examined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Of particular interest were members of six of the eight species most commonly recovered from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women, namely, Lactobacillus jensenii, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, and L. fermentum. Six main groupings were identified on the basis of ribotyping. This technique was able to classify fresh isolates to the species level. In the case of the ribotype A grouping for L. rhamnosus, differences between strains were evident by chromosome typing (chromotyping). Many isolates did not possess plasmids. Six L. rhamnosus strains isolated from four different health food products appeared to be identical to L. rhamnosus ATCC 21052. The molecular typing system is useful for identifying and differentiating Lactobacillus isolates. Studies of strains of potential importance to the urogenital flora should include molecular characterization as a means of comparing genetic traits with those of strains whose characteristics associated with colonization and antagonism against pathogens have been defined.
TI  - Adhesion of some probiotic and dairy Lactobacillus strains to Caco-2 cell cultures.
AB  - The adhesion of 12 different Lactobacillus strains was studied using Caco-2 cell  line as an in vitro model for intestinal epithelium. Some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. Human and bovine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains were used as positive and negative control, respectively. Bacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. The adherence of bacteria was also observed microscopically after Gram staining. Viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. Among the tested strains, L. casei (Fyos) was the most adhesive strain and L. casei var. rhamnosus (Lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to Caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. The corresponding values for positive and negative control E. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. The Lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. The four most adhesive strains were L. casei (Fyos), L. acidophilus 1 (LC1), L. rhamnosus LC-705 and Lactobacillus GG (ATCC 53103). No significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. Adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of Caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the Caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. Viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90% of the bacteria were viable with the exception of L. acidophilus 1 which was 74% viable. Microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in Gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.
TI  - Ecological study of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Lactobacillus spp. at sub-sites from approximal dental plaque from children.
AB  - Previous immunofluorescence (IF) studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans may preferentially colonise specific sub-sites within approximal plaque. The present study aimed to extend these observations to other mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in such gingival margin plaque. Two hundred and seventy approximal plaque samples were taken from 90 teeth (3 from each tooth) in 64 children; three gingival margin sub-sites in relation to the contact area: away from (A), to the side of(S) and below (B) the contact area. Samples were processed by indirect IF using high-titred polyclonal anti-S. mutans 'c', anti-S. sobrinus 'd', anti-L. casei and anti-L. acidophilus antisera. An overall positive association was found between S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' (p < 0.001). Significant differences (p < 0.1) were found between the proportional counts at each sub-site for S. mutans 'c': A = 39%, S = 51% and B = 70%, and for S. sobrinus 'd' 21, 33 and 49%. Mutans streptococci (MS) appeared to preferentially colonise the sub-site below the contact area (B = 81%), compared with sub-sites A and S (48 and 62%, respectively). S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' were detected together at subsites A = 12%, S = 22%, and B = 38%, with proportional counts at B sites being higher than those at A (B > A, p < 0.01, and B > S, p < 0.05). Lactobacillus spp. were isolated rarely, and were usually found together with MS. There was a positive relationship between the presence of lactobacilli or MS and caries (white spot lesions only), although these species could frequently be isolated from noncarious sites. The presence of both S. mutans 'c' and S. sobrinus 'd' were strongly correlated with early caries lesions. In addition, this study confirmed the variation in the microflora at different sub-sites within approximal dental plaque.
TI  - Biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  - Four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. Each bacterial species and Candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. The presence of probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei GG, or Bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with C. albicans alone. The incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. The numbers of C. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by L. casei GG and B. animalis. None of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but B. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. Probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to C. albicans. The prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of C. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.
TI  - Colonization of congenitally immunodeficient mice with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - We assessed the capacity of four probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei GG, and Bifidobacterium animalis) to colonize, infect, stimulate immune responses in, and affect the growth and survival of congenitally immunodeficient gnotobiotic beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu) and beige-euthymic (bg/bg-nu/+) mice. The bacteria colonized and persisted, in pure culture, in the alimentary tracts of both mouse strains for the entire study period (12 weeks). Although all adult and neonatal beige-euthymic mice survived probiotic colonization, some infant mortality occurred in beige-athymic pups born to mothers colonized with pure cultures of L. reuteri or L. casei GG. The probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. Although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required.
TI  - Fermented products with probiotic qualities.
AB  - For several centuries, fermented products derived from plant or animal materials  have been an acceptable and essential part of the diet in most parts of the world. Health benefits have also often been associated with them. Probiotics can be defined as fermented food containing specific live microorganisms or a live microbial food or feed supplement, which beneficially effects the human or the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Nearly all probiotics currently on the market contain Lactobacilli, Streptococci, Enterococci or Bifidobacteria. In contrast to Japan, where freeze-dried microorganisms are consumed by a substantial part of the human population, in Europe, probiotic action towards humans are only claimed for certain fermented dairy products (e.g. yoghurts). Those species that have been extensively studied so far, with several experimental trials on man, are the two yoghurt bacteria Streptocaccus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei and Bifidobacteria. L. acidophilus has also received important scientific interest, however, only a few human studies have been carried out. From the technological point of view a good probiotic should be stable and viable for long periods under storage, should be able to survive the low pH levels of the stomach, be able to colonise the epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract of the host, should not be pathogenic and, last but not least, must be capable of exerting a growth promoting effect or a resistance to infectious diseases. The beneficial effects of probiotics are mainly contributed to a direct antagonistic effect against specific groups of microorganisms (Enteropathogenes), by an effect on the metabolism in the gut or by a stimulation of systemic or mucosal immunity. We will present major proven health benefits of milks fermented with those bacterial species and discuss, where possible, the impact of the specific selection and utilisation of particular strains.
TI  - Pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  - Pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. The overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. Anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. Gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,Clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. Vaginitis has been experimentally studied using L. acidophilus and L. casei GG. The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. Requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
TI  - 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) transformation by clostridia isolated from a munition-fed bioreactor: comparison with non-adapted bacteria.
AB  - Several bacterial strains were examined for their ability to degrade the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). The strains examined included various clostridial strains isolated from a 4-year-old munition enrichment, related clostridial strains obtained from a culture collection, two enteric bacteria, and three lactobacilli. All Clostridium species tested were able to reduce TNT rapidly in a complex medium. In cell suspension experiments, these strains were also able to reduce 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (DANT) to 2,4,6-triaminotoluene (TAT) and to produce a compound that is not yet identified; thus, they could not be distinguished from one another with regard to the pathway of transformation. The enteric strains and the lactobacilli were able to perform the initial reduction of TNT, but none was capable of reducing DANT in cell suspensions.
TI  - Chemical composition of the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria and related species.
AB  - In order to examine the relationship between biological activities and the cell wall content, the murein type and the teichoic acid of the cell wall from five strains of bacteria were studied. Two of these Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 and L. acidophilus CRL 730, are used in a commercial fermented milk (BIO MILK), which is believed to be beneficial for health. The other strains, Lactococcus lactis CRL 526, Pediococcus pentosaceus CRL 923 and Propionibacterium acidipropionici CRL 1198 were included in order to compare the cell wall structures of active and inactive strains. A method was designed to confirm the amino acids of the peptidoglycan in impure substrates. Four of the studied strains, L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. lactis and P. acidipropionici, contained glycerol teichoic acids. L. casei, L. acidophilus, P. pentosaceus and L. lactis contained A4 alpha type murein, while P. acidipropionici contained A3 gamma type. The capacity of orally administered peptidoglycans of the studied strains to stimulate phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages was analyzed. Only the PG of L. casei showed this activity. No differences were observed between active and inactive strains with respect to the chemical composition of the peptidoglycan. Therefore the biological activity is unlikely to be due to the peptidoglycan structure.
TI  - The Lactobacillus acidophilus S-layer protein gene expression site comprises two  consensus promoter sequences, one of which directs transcription of stable mRNA.
AB  - S-proteins are proteins which form a regular structure (S-layer) on the outside of the cell walls of many bacteria. Two S-protein-encoding genes are located in opposite directions on a 6.0-kb segment of the chromosome of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 bacteria. Inversion of this chromosomal segment occurs through recombination between two regions with identical sequences, thereby interchanging the expressed and the silent genes. In this study, we show that the region involved in recombination also has a function in efficient S-protein production. Two promoter sequences are present in the S-protein gene expression site, although only the most downstream promoter (P-1) is used to direct mRNA synthesis. S-protein mRNA directed by this promoter has a half-life of 15 min. Its untranslated leader can form a stable secondary structure in which the 5' end is base paired, whereas the ribosome-binding site is exposed. Truncation of this leader sequence results in a reduction in protein production, as shown by reporter gene analysis of Lactobacillus casei. The results obtained indicate that the untranslated leader sequence of S-protein mRNA is involved in efficient S-protein production.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of three commercial 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agents (Nite White, Karisma, and Opalescence) on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was examined. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. Test materials and control solution were inserted in wells punched on the surface of disk sensitivity agars seeded with bacteria. After incubation of 24 to 48 h, zones of inhibition were measured. All three of the test materials displayed greater inhibition than the control. The pH of the solutions did not effect the bacterial inhibition.
TI  - Inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from Lactobacillus isolates.
AB  - In this study, 15 Lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. The stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus fermentum B54, and Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The initial deposition rate of E. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from L. acidophilus RC14 or L. fermentum B54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. The surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of E. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000 to 8,000) and freeze-drying. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from L. acidophilus RC14 and L. fermentum B54 were richest in protein, while those from L. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and ATCC 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on growth, nitrogen utilisation and serum cholesterol in broilers.
AB  - 1. The effect of dietary probiotic supplementation on the growth, nitrogen utilisation and serum cholesterol content of broiler chickens was studied in 2 trials. 2. In experiment 1, the birds receiving the 0, 75, 100, 125 mg probiotic/kg diets had weight gains of 1204.0, 1272.0, 1268.3 and 1210.5, respectively at the end of 8 weeks of feeding. The group of birds fed on the 75 mg probiotic supplemented diet retained significantly (P < 0.01) more nitrogen than the control birds. Serum cholesterol content was lower in the probiotic-supplemented birds (93.3 mg/100 ml) compared to the control birds (132.2 mg/100 ml). 3. In the second experiment the probiotic plus antibiotic-supplemented group of birds had the maximum weight gain (1148.5 g) followed by antibiotic (1141.3 g), probiotic-supplemented (1128.4 g) and control birds (1045.6 g) after 6 weeks. Nitrogen retention was greatest in the antibiotic--(48.5%) followed by the probiotic--(46.5%), probiotic plus antibiotic-supplemented groups (46.3%) compared to 40.2% in control birds. 4. The apparent metabolisable energy was greatest in birds receiving the probiotic plus antibiotic-supplemented diet (12.37 MJ/kg) followed by antibiotic--(12.00 MJ/kg), probiotic-supplemented birds (11.92 MJ/kg) than in control birds (11.62 MJ/kg). Serum cholesterol was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in probiotic-supplemented birds (86.1 mg/dl) compared to 118.4 mg/dl in control birds.
TI  - Viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in fermented milk  products during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The viability was investigated of five strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus casei that were added as adjuncts to yogurt and cultured buttermilk during 28 d of refrigerated storage at 5 to 7 degrees C. A modification of LBS (Lactobacillus selection) agar was used for the enumeration of L. acidophilus and L. casei. The medium allowed the colony formation of the adjunct bacteria while preventing colony formation of the traditional yogurt or buttermilk starter cultures. At each sampling period, colonies from the selective agar medium were isolated for confirmation of identity to confirm that only L. acidophilus and L. casei were enumerated, that their characteristics did not change during storage, or both. The strains of L. acidophilus varied in both cultured products. In buttermilk, L. acidophilus MUH-41, O-16, and L-1 exhibited no significant loss in viability, but strains 43121 and La-5 did. No significant loss in viability of L. acidophilus MUH-41 and L-1 occurred in yogurt prepared using culture CM2; however, strains 43121, O-16, and La-5 lost viability. In the yogurt prepared using culture YC-4, L. acidophilus 43121 exhibited no significant loss in viability, but MUH-41, O-16, L-1, and La-5 did. There was no loss in viability of L. casei GG during storage of any of the cultured products.
TI  - The potential of Lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  - Oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (Gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). The adjuvant function of different Lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. After i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high DTH responses were observed with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In different experimental model systems L. casei and L. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. A series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the L. casei L-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the Lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (Pouwels and Leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. Intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. Lactobacilli synthesizing the fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous priming.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on serum/yolk cholesterol and on egg shell thickness in layers.
AB  - 1. The effect of probiotic supplementation on egg production, on serum and yolk cholesterol and on egg shell thickness in 24 White Leghorn layers was studied from 28-38 weeks of age. 2. In 3 treatments the diet was supplemented with 0, 100 and 150 mg probiotic/kg food. 3. In the 100 mg probiotic group, egg production improved by 5%, and shell thickness improved slightly, with fewer thin-shelled eggs than in the control (8.6% compared to 18.6%). 4. The initial serum cholesterol concentration of 170.2 mg/dl in control birds remained similar throughout the 10-week experimental period, whereas in the 150 mg group the initial value of 176.5 mg/dl decreased to 114.3 mg by week 10. 5. Yolk cholesterol concentration was 14.69 mg in the control group and 11.28 and 11.37 mg/g in the 100 and 150 mg probiotic groups respectively. Overall mean total egg cholesterol was thus reduced by probiotic supplementation.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  - A total of 169 Lactobacillus strains from 12 species (Lb. acidophilus, Lb. brevis, Lb. buchneri, Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. helveticus, Lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 Lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 by organic acids and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study the effects of both pH and organic acids on Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 were tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. casei, Lact. bulgaricus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Bifidobacterium bifidus were assayed for their lactic acid production, pH and inhibition of H. pylori growth. A standard antimicrobial plate well diffusion assay was employed to examine inhibitory effects. Lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids demonstrated inhibition of H. pylori growth in a concentration-dependent manner with the lactic acid demonstrating the greatest inhibition. This inhibition was due both to the pH of the solution and its concentration. Six strains of Lact. acidophilus and one strain of Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus inhibited H. pylori growth where as Bifidobacterium bifidus, Ped. pentosaceus and Lact. bulgaricus did not. Concentrations of lactic acid produced by these strains ranged from 50 to 156 mmol l-1 and correlated with H. pylori inhibition. The role of probiotic organisms and their metabolic by-products in the eradication of H. pylori in vivo remains to be determined.
TI  - Influence of lactobacilli on the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans to fibers and epithelial cells.
AB  - The ability of organisms to adhere to and form biofilms on fibrous materials is believed to be an important initiating step in the induction of several diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome. Using an in vitro assay, a moderately hydrophobic strain of Staphylococcus aureus (water contact angle 35 degrees) and a hydrophilic Candida albicans (shown by a hexadecane test) were highly adherent to commercial diaper fibers. The lumen side of the diaper was porous and the fibers were very hydrophobic (> 140 degrees), but the internal section was very hydrophilic (0 degrees), presumably for lus strains was present. Surfaces precoated with lactobacilli inhibited staphylococcal adhesion by 26-97%, and candida by 0-67%. When the lactobacilli were used to challenge adherent pathogens, there was 99% displacement of the S. aureus and up to 91% displacement of C. albicans. Hydrophobic L. acidophilus 76 (54 degrees) and T-13 (80 degrees) were the most effective of five Lactobacillus isolates tested at interference by precoating. The moderately hydrophilic L. casei var rhamnosus GR-1 (33 degrees) was the most effective at displacing the yeast. Experiments with uroepithelial cells also showed that the lactobacilli could significantly interfere with the adhesion of both pathogens to the cells. The results demonstrate the rapidity with which two pathogens adhered to fibers and epithelial cells, and raised the possibility that members of the normal female urogenital flora might interfere with infections caused by these organisms.
TI  - In vitro colonization ability of human colon mucosa by exogenous Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - We have tested five Lactobacillus strains for their in vitro colonization ability in a human colon epithelium culture model. Positive colonization occurred in different degrees in the presence of four Lactobacillus strains. We have found that L. casei GG and L. acidophilus NCFB 1748 induce an intermediate colonization. These two strains, largely investigated by others, have been reported to be beneficial to humans. The use of human intestinal tissue in our study partially reconstitutes the complex architectural specificity of human epithelium with the mucus layer and more closely simulates the in vivo situation.
TI  - In vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of Salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  - In vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against Salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus sp., and Salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS-50 or FOS pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. Thirteen bacteria (two strains of Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, B. bifidum, E. faecium, two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, Pediococcus sp., Propionibacterium acidopropionici, P. jensenii, and Propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six Salmonella serotypes (S. california, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg, S. mission, S. senftenberg, and S. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. Bifidobacterium bifidum, E. faecium, all lactobacilli, and Pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all Salmonella serotypes. In the growth experiments, E. faecium, L. lactis, and Pediococcus sp. grew in media with either FOS-50 or the pure formulation of FOS as the sole carbohydrate source. All tested Salmonella serotypes utilized FOS-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. In contrast, none of the Salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of FOS as the only carbohydrate source.
TI  - Inability of Lactobacillus casei strain GG, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum to degrade intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria have been suggested for use in the prevention of relapse of ulcerative colitis and of recurrent pouchitis. These strains may not damage the protective intestinal mucus glycoproteins. METHODS: Lactobacillus casei strain GG and strains isolated from a commercial fermented product (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and a mesophylic lactic culture) were cultured in vitro on hog gastric mucin and human intestinal glycoproteins. Furthermore, germ-free rats were mono-associated with Lactobacillus GG and poly-associated with the other strains. Glycoproteins were isolated from rat distal ileum, cecum, and colon. Mucus degradation was established by assaying carbohydrates (hexosamines, hexoses, pentoses), proteins, and blood group antigenicity. RESULTS: All strains colonized the intestinal mucus but were not found in the deep crypts. Degradation of mucus glycoproteins was observed neither in vitro nor in vivo. CONCLUSION: The tested strains do not break down intestinal mucus glycoproteins and thus far are safe to use for therapy.
TI  - The lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc species, L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. The lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal pH and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. The cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. In the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). By contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. The presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. No doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. Meanwhile the obtention of a Lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified PL1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of L. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.
TI  - [Lactose digestion by milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei of human origin].
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine whether a fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains isolated from human subjects (CFM) and developed by CERELA (Centro de referencia para Lactobacilos) is better tolerated than regular milk (RM) by subjects with lactase deficiency (< 1 unidad) and lactose intolerance. We studied the digestion of the lactose present in the two milk preparations which were administered to 18 healthy subjects with lactase deficiency and 12 control subjects. Each subject ingested in random sequence on different days, 480 ml CFM, 480 ml RM and 240 ml CFM and 240 ml RM. Breath hydrogen (H2) test was used to measure lactose absorption and orocecal transit time (OCTT). The peak H2 ppm results after 480 ml of CFM were ingested, reached 19.5 +/- 12.1 ppm. The same reading when 480 ml of RM were ingested was 52.6 +/- 31.9 ppm (p < 0.008). The results also showed that 480 ml of CFM delayed OCTT median 111.0 +/- 6.78 min versus 54.0 +/- 5.09 min of RM (p < 0.001) and reduced the development of symptoms (p < 0.08) such as bloating (p < 0.05), borborygmi (p < 0.025) diarrhea (p < 0.05) and abdominal colics (p < 0.05). In spite of the small number of cases studied, it seems justified to conclude that CERELA fermented milk significantly influences lactose digestion and minor development of symptoms in lactase-deficient subjects and lengthens significantly the orocecal transit time compared with regular milk.
TI  - Immunomodulation of the gnotobiotic mouse through colonization with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Effects of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin on physicochemical surface properties of  Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Under clinical conditions, during antibiotic treatment, micro-organisms often grow at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This may lead to altered adhesive cell surface properties and to a disruption of the indigenous microflora, in addition to the creation of a more pathogenic biofilm. The effects of growing Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and lactobacilli in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were determined. Growing the cells under antibiotic burden sometimes led to altered cell surface hydrophobicity (by adhesion to hexadecane), changes in the pH-dependence of zeta potentials, and elemental surface compositions or in different SDS-PAGE protein profiles. For several isolates only one of the surface properties was altered by the presence of an antibiotic in the growth medium and no systematic effects were observed for all isolates representing a certain species or even strain. The important conclusion to be drawn from the results of this study is that the effects of growing cells under antibiotic burden on their adhesive cell surface properties can only be established when using a variety of techniques.
TI  - Effects of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth and catalase activity.
AB  - In the vagina and endocervix, Neisseria gonorrhoeae must interact with complex microflora. Among these are lactobacilli, which may inhibit the growth of gonococci. Lactobacillus acidophilus, which produce H2O2 (LB+), and L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei, which do not produce H2O2 (LB-), were coincubated with catalase-positive and -deficient strains of N. gonorrhoeae. When the incubation medium was maintained at pH 7.3, neither LB+ nor LB- affected gonococcal growth. However, LB+ caused a significant increase in expression of gonococcal catalase, which could be offset by exposure of the bacteria to exogenous catalase. When coincubation medium was at lower pH (4.8-5.0), there was a significant decrease in gonococcal survival and catalase activity, which was only partly reversed by exogenous catalase. Lysates of LB+ also effectively inhibited gonococcal catalase. This inhibition was retained upon heating of the lysate to 100 degrees C for 15 min but was lost with proteinase K treatment. Thus, LB+ may inhibit growth of gonococci by acidification of the environment, secretion of H2O2, and production of protein inhibitors.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Divergence in codon usage of Lactobacillus species.
AB  - We have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different Lactobacillus species. Codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. Both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. Codon usage in L. acidophilus is similar to that in L. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. pentosus and L. plantarum. Codon usage in the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from that in L. bulgaricus. Inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. L. bulgaricus shows GC drift, whereas all other species show AT drift. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus rarely use NNG in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. This result may be explained by assuming that L. acidophilus and L. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single tRNA species for translation of family-box codons. Differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. Highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. Codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of Lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. The GC content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. The possible implications of a reduced GC content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.
TI  - Biotherapeutic role of fermented milk.
AB  - Fermented milk was used as therapy in infantile diarrhoea due to post-gastroenteritis syndrome. This treatment eliminated the disease in 4.0 days (mean value, SD = 2.8; n = 13) and allowed patients to return to free feeding according to their age. The weight percentile variation during treatment with fermented milk (15 days) was higher in the patients showing 3rd degree malnutrition than in other children. Bacteriotherapy can restore faecal flora which has been lowered by diarrhoea. Our results showed that levels higher than 10(6) UFC lactobacilli/g of faeces correlated with a healthy status of the children. Clinical applications of fermented milk with a mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders are possible.
TI  - Growth of lactobacilli, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
AB  - The growth of three lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and L. casei), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus 6032 and L. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. S. aureus 26003 and E. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. These mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. Among the lactobacilli, L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus grew faster than L. casei in both types of milk samples. All the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. However, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of L. casei. Pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. All the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
TI  - The fermentation of trahanas: a milk-wheat flour combination.
AB  - The fermented food, trahanas (a milk-wheat flour combination prepared in Greece), was studied to determine the microbiological and chemical changes that occur during fermentation. It is a lactic acid bacterial fermentation in which Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus diacetylactis, Leuconostoc cremoris, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus acidophilus play the major acid- and aroma-producing role. The whole fermentation lasts about 50 hours. The pH of the final dried trahanas was 4.07-4.75, the acidity 0.60-1.00%, the moisture content 8.6-11.5% and the protein content 10.4-13.6%. The product offers possibilities as an increased nutritive value or high-protein food.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the substance isolated from Streptosporangium species which inhibits lactic acid production by oral bacteria.
AB  - 1. The tentatively named MLI, which inhibits lactic acid production in mutants streptococci, was isolated from Streptosporangium species and purified by solvent extraction followed by chromatography, and then powdered. 2. MLI greatly inhibited pH-decline and lactic acid production in glucose-containing reaction mixture by mutans streptococci or Lactobacillus species. 3. These inhibitory mechanisms were not caused by an anti-bacterial effect, since the addition of a sufficient concentration of MLI to inhibit lactic acid production to the culture, recovery of cells in culture was not affected, excluding L. acidophilus. 4. MLI directly affected lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. 5. These results indicate that MLI may represent a new anti-cariogenic substance.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  - Two-hundred and fifty Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. Data were processed by the Jaccard (SJ) and Simple Matching (SSM) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Seventeen major clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level which approximately correspond to the SSM-level of 91%. Seven clusters could be identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), Lact. buchneri (4% of patients), Lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and Lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). Unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains. Cluster 1 included the type strains of Lact. crispatus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. jensenii and Lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. agilis and Lact. casei subsp. tolerans. Clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. No obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. Most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. Exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. Cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
TI  - In vitro studies on the growth of Shigella sonnei by Lactobacillus casei and Lact. acidophilus.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of lactobacilli on growth of Shigella sonnei was studied. The effect was not due to pH alone, as addition of hydrochloric, lactic or acetic acids to culture media did not inhibit the normal growth of the shigellas. The degree of inhibition was measured by disc assay and showed that the inhibitory substance(s) can be extracellular and diffusible, varying the degrees of inhibition depending on the media tested. When broth was inoculated with mixed cultures of Lactobacillus and Shigella strains, the inhibition began at 6 h and the death phase at 9 h. The higher inhibition was produced by the mixture of lactobacilli (35.5 +/- 2.5% at 6 h culture, 57.4 +/- 1.9% at 9 h and 91.2 +/- 1.2% at 14 h). The degree of inhibition was higher when the relationship pathogen : lactobacilli was 1:10(3). The specific growth rate of lactobacilli and shigella was different in pure or mixed cultures. When the lactobacillus alone was grown for 12 h and the shigellas then added, the numbers of shigellas began to decrease immediately at 37 degrees C. This work shows that the Lactobacillus strains employed in fermented milk can be used to inhibit the growth of Sh. sonnei.
TI  - Inhibition of Shigella sonnei by Lactobacillus casei and Lact. acidophilus.
AB  - The protective effect of feeding milk fermented with a mixture of Lactobacillus casei and Lact. acidophilus against Shigella sonnei was studied. There was a 100% survival rate in mice fed for 8 d with fermented milk and then dosed orally with Sh. sonnei. The survival rate in control mice was approximately 60% after 21 d. Colonization of the liver and spleen with Sh. sonnei was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with fermented milk. Differences in cell counts of 2-3 log units between treated and control mice were always obtained, shigellas were not detected in these organs by the 10th day in treated mice, while high levels were maintained in the controls. Higher levels of anti-shigella antibodies were found both in sera and in small intestinal fluid of mice treated with fermented milk, suggesting that the protective immunity could be mediated by the mucosal tissue. These results suggest that milk fermented with Lact. casei and Lact. acidophilus could be used as a prophylactic against gastrointestinal infections by shigellas.
TI  - Two cases of endocarditis due to Lactobacillus species: antimicrobial susceptibility, review, and discussion of therapy.
AB  - Endocarditis caused by lactobacilli may lead to death or to relapse of infection, despite antimicrobial treatment. We report two cases of lactobacillus endocarditis in individuals with native bicuspid aortic valves who survived without relapse and review the 39 other cases reported in the literature. In only 15 previously reported cases have patients been cured with medical therapy alone. One of our patients, who was infected with Lactobacillus acidophilus, was cured by medical therapy alone, and our other patient, who was infected with Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus, required surgical replacement of his aortic valve. L. acidophilus was tolerant and L. casei subspecies rhamnosus was resistant to many antibiotics tested. Combinations of penicillin or daptomycin and gentamicin were synergistic by time-kill assay. Synergistic therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside was effective clinically and appears to provide optimal medical treatment on the basis of microbiological data.
TI  - [Phosphoenolpyruvate:hexose phosphotransferase systems in Lactobacillus species].
AB  - The substrate range of phosphoenolpyruvate:hexose phosphotransferase systems (hexose-PTSs) in Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei LAC3 and L. acidophilus LAC5 was examined. Strain LAC3 demonstrated PTS activities for glucose (Glc), mannose (Man), glucosamine (GcN), 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and fructose (Fru), while strain LAC5 showed the activities only for Man and Fru. These activities were all constitutive. Growth of both strains was strongly inhibited by 2DG. 2DG-resistant mutants DG329 and DG504 were isolated, respectively, from strains LAC3 and LAC5. Mutant DG329 grown on Glc was defective in all the above-described activities observed with strain LAC3, whereas no defect in PTS activities was found in mutant DG504. Mutant DG329, however, showed some inducible activities for Man and Fru when grown on Man, Fru or Scr. These results strongly suggest that strain LAC3 has inducible PTS(s) specific for Man and/or Fru besides the well-known, broadly specific, constitutive Man-PTS, and also that strain LAC5 lacks the Man-PTS, but has other constitutive PTS(s) specific for Man and/or Fru. L. fermentum LAC12 had the Man-PTS as reported previously (Nagasaki et al., 1992), but had no inducible activities like those found in strain LAC3.
TI  - Protein-mediated adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4 on human enterocyte and mucus-secreting cell lines in culture.
AB  - The adhesion of Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, a human stool isolate, to two human enterocytelike cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) and to the mucus secreted by a subpopulation of mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the bacteria interacted with the well-defined apical microvilli of Caco-2 cells without cell damage and with the mucus secreted by the subpopulation of HT29-MTX cells. The adhesion to Caco-2 cells did not require calcium and involved an adhesion-promoting factor that was present in the spent supernatant of L. acidophilus cultures. This factor promoted adhesion of poorly adhering human Lactobacillus casei GG but did not promote adhesion of L. casei CNRZ 387, a strain of dairy origin. The adherence components on the bacterial cells and in the spent supernatant were partially characterized. Carbohydrates on the bacterial cell wall appeared to be partly responsible for the interaction between the bacteria and the extracellular adhesion-promoting factor. The adhesion-promoting factor was proteinaceous, since trypsin treatment dramatically decreased the adhesion of the L. acidophilus strain. The adhesion-promoting factor may be an important component of Lactobacillus species that colonize the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide production by Lactobacillus species: correlation with susceptibility to the spermicidal compound nonoxynol-9.
AB  - Facultative anaerobic lactobacilli were recovered from the vaginas of 96.8% of 63 nonpregnant, healthy, premenopausal women. The predominant species were Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei. Of the women, 74.6% had hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, 22.2% had non-hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, and 3.2% had no lactobacilli. None of the 68 isolates had catalase activity. Some 68.2% of the isolates were inhibited by concentrations of less than or equal to 1% (wt/vol) of nonoxynol-9 (bactericidal for 73.3% of isolates, bacteriostatic for 26.7%). The remaining 31.8% could grow in all concentrations to 25% (wt/vol) of nonoxynol-9. All of the lactobacilli that were sensitive to nonoxynol-9 produced hydrogen peroxide whereas only 3 of 21 resistant strains were hydrogen peroxide producers. A significant correlation (P less than .001, chi 2 test) was found between hydrogen peroxide production and sensitivity to nonoxynol-9. It is suggested that the vaginal flora of spermicide users could be depleted of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, possibly increasing susceptibility to urogenital infection.
TI  - Comparison of contact angles and adhesion to hexadecane of urogenital, dairy, and poultry lactobacilli: effect of serial culture passages.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the hydrophobicities of 23 urogenital, dairy, poultry, and American Type Culture Collection isolates of lactobacilli and to determine the effect on hydrophobicity of serially passaging the strains in liquid medium. To this end, strains were grown after isolation and identification and then serially passaged up to 20 times. Hydrophobicity was assessed through contact angle measurements on lawns of cells by using water, formamide, methylene iodide, 1-bromonaphthalene, and hexadecane as wetting agents and through measurement of their partitioning in a hexadecane-water system. The hydrophobicities of these strains varied widely, with Lactobacillus casei strains being predominantly hydrophilic and L. acidophilus strains being mostly hydrophobic. For some isolates, serial passaging was accompanied by a clear loss of hydrophobic surface properties, whereas for other strains, cultures became heterogeneous in that some cells had already lost their hydrophobic surface properties while others were still hydrophobic. Adhesion of this collection of lactobacilli to hexadecane droplets in microbial adhesion to hexadecane (MATH) tests was driven by their aversion to water rather than by their affinity for hexadecane, as concluded from the fact that hexadecane contact angles were zero for all strains. Furthermore, adhesion of the lactobacilli to hexadecane in MATH tests occurred only when the water contact angle on the cells was above 60 degrees.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.
AB  - The antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 as an indicator bacterium. Each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The milk cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. Changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by Lb. acidophilus LA 106 (LA2) during incubation were also examined using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.
TI  - Antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  - Immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (SF) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. In this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the SF from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two ATCC strains of Eubacterium were also included in this assay. Specific antibodies to Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (I), (II), Streptococcus mutans, Bacteroides intermedius, Eubacterium brachy, and Eubacterium alactolyticum in the SF from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. Immunodiffusion assays of the SF revealed that IgG was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. The presence of natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.
TI  - Noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  - Erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by Aureobasidium sp. from glucose. It is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. The aim of this study was to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. Erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. It was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans PS-14 (c) and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). Finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- SEM) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). Also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with S. mutans PS-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). The main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli and streptococci.
AB  - Of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria commonly used as starter cultures for the dalry industry and ensiling, six (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. acidophilus CH=5, L. plantarum, Streptococcus latis and Strep. taecium) had antibiotic activity. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria to the antibiotics. The most sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus was used as a target micro-organism for the characterization of the antimicrobial substance. The cultures of Streptococcus faecium and L. plantarum gave the most intense antimicrobial activity. Adding CaCO3 to the medium (to bind accumulated lactic acid) increased the antibiotic activity of the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Incompatibility of Lactobacillus Vectors with Replicons Derived from Small Cryptic Lactobacillus Plasmids and Segregational Instability of the Introduced Vectors.
AB  - Three new Lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic Lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. The shuttle vector pLP3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from Lactobacillus pentosus MD353, an erythromycin resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194, and pUC19 as a replicon for Escherichia coli. The vectors pLPE317 and pLPE323, which do not contain E. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pE194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from L. pentosus MD353, respectively. These vectors and the shuttle vector pLP825 (M. Posno, R. J. Leer, J. M. M. van Rijn, B. C. Lokman, and P. H. Pouwels, p. 397-401, in A. T. Ganesan and J. A. Hoch, ed., Genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into Lactobacillus casei, L. pentosus, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, and L. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. Transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of DNA. Plasmid DNA analysis of L. pentosus MD353 transformants revealed that the introduction of pLP3537 or pLPE323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. Remarkably, pLPE317 could only be introduced into an L. pentosus MD353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb plasmid. The curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. Lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. However, pLPE323 is stable in three of four Lactobacillus strains tested so far.
TI  - [Immunobiologic properties of lactobacilli].
AB  - The authors investigated in experiments on mice immunobiological properties of selected strains of lactobacilli (Lbc. acidophilus, Lbc. casei and Lbc. delbruecki). Their immunostimulating action was evaluated from the migrating capacity of lymphocytes into the interepithelial spaces and lamina propria mucosae of the gut. The most marked changes were observed in the group of animals to whom Lbc. acidophilus and Lbc. casei was administered for two weeks by a gastric tube. The protective properties of lactobacilli on the course and development of model infections (virus of encephalomyocarditis) was greatest in mice given Lbc. casei and Lbc. acidophilus by the intraperitoneal route four days before infection. At the end of the two-week period in the Lbc. casei group 66% mice survived and in the Lbc. acidophilus group 34%. The ability of lactobacilli to influence the interferon producing activity was investigated in vitro on a model of peritoneal cells obtained from premedicated mice. The lactobacilli strains themselves did not have interferon inducing properties. However, when the interferon producing capacity of peritoneal cells was assessed after administration of the viral inducer (virus of Newcastle disease) the capacity was much higher, when compared with controls.
TI  - Prevention of gastrointestinal infection using immunobiological methods with milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The protective effect of feeding milk fermented with a mixture of Lactobacillus casei sp. and Lb. acidophilus sp. against Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice was compared with that obtained feeding milks fermented with these microorganisms individually. The survival rate obtained after oral infection with Sal. typhimurium was 100% in mice pretreated by feeding during 8 d with the mixture of Lb. casei and Lb. acidophilus fermented milks. Similar treatments with the individual milks were ineffective. Moreover, mice became more susceptible to infection with Sal. typhimurium after such treatment. The colonization of liver and spleen with the pathogen was markedly inhibited by the pretreatment with the mixture of fermented milk, while such inhibition was not observed using the Lb. casei and Lb. acidophilus milks. The highest levels of anti-salmonellae antibodies in serum and in intestinal fluid were found in the group of mice fed with the mixture and with Lb. casei fermented milk respectively. However, this latter milk was not effective in protecting against Sal. typhimurium. When the mice were first infected with Sal. typhimurium and then fed with the mixture of fermented milks, pathogen colonization was not prevented. The results suggest that the augmentation of resistance to salmonellae caused by the treatment with Lb. casei- + Lb. acidophilus-fermented milk was due to the anti-salmonellae protective immunity mainly mediated by the mucosal tissue. Milk fermented with this mixture could be used as an immunobiological method to prevent gastrointestinal infection.
TI  - [Penicillin-binding proteins of various strains of Lactobacillus].
AB  - Sensitivity of different species of Lactobacillus i.e. L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophillus, L. buchneri, L. jugurti and others to penicillins and cephalosporins of various generations was studied. Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of the Lactobacillus species were specified. It was shown that the number of PBPs depended on the Lactobacillus species. L. casei had the least number of PBPs (4) and L. brevis had the highest number of PBPs (11). Competition of 14C-benzylpenicillin with ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime and cefoperazone for binding to separate PBPs in three strains of different Lactobacillus species was investigated.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase activity in some strains of lactobacilli: induction by manganese.
AB  - Dialyzed cell-free extract of lactobacilli was found to contain superoxide dismutase activity by using a test system in which superoxide ion is generated by xanthine oxidase. The specific activities of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus murinus ATCC 35020, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 358, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014, Lactobacillus casei CRL 431, Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 353, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 9338, Lactobacillus buchneri NCDO 110, and Lactobacillus fermentum CRL 251 were between 0.06 and 0.43 U/mg protein. The presence of superoxide dismutase activity was demonstrated when the strains were grown in media containing Mn2+ ions. Superoxide dismutase of lactobacilli may be an Mn enzyme since it was not inhibited by either cyanide or azide ions. However, the cell-free extract of Lactobacillus murinus ATCC 35020 contains superoxide dismutase activity sensitive to both ions.
TI  - The effect of pH on the sensitivity of species of Lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of Lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, Minocycline, and Spiramycin, at a range of pH from 5.0 to 7.4. Strains of Streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. There were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. The strains tested were sensitive at pH 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/mL): L. casei (6 strains), 10-60; L. plantarum (4 strains), 40; L. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; L. brevis (1 strain), 10; and L. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. The Streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/mL (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/mL (3 strains); and 10-20 micrograms/mL (2 strains). One strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/mL. Chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower pH levels. The following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/mL) at pH 6.5 followed by sensitivity at pH 5.0: L. casei (ATCC 15008), 40,60; L. plantarum (CH 374), 40,100; L. fermentum (CH 324) 10,40; L. acidophilus (ATCC 4356), 10,40; and S. mutans (BM 52), 2,2. All of the strains of Lactobacillus tested with Spiramycin were resistant at pH 5.0. Minocycline was less affected by changes in pH, but at pH 7.4 Lactobacillus strains were more resistant to Minocycline as compared with Spiramycin. Both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. The Lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of Streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  - [Species composition of intestinal lactoflora of healthy rhesus monkeys].
AB  - The results of the study of the species composition of the fecal microflora of 15 healthy rhesus macaques, from whom 204 strains of lactobacilli have been isolated and identified, are presented. The intestinal microflora has been shown to include different species, subspecies and biovars of homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli and to possess definite individual properties. L. acidophilus, mannose-negative biovar I, and L. fermentum, mannose-negative biovars I and II, occur most frequently in feces. Certain differences in the species composition of lactoflora in monkeys and humans have been revealed: in the former, L. fermentum, mannitose-positive biovar III, and L. casei occur considerably more seldom. The inclusion of L. acidophilus strain I L. fermentum strains I and II isolated from rhesus macaques into eubiotics for these monkeys has been suggested.
TI  - Production of succinic Acid from citric Acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe  broth to various extents. Among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in Thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 Lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 L. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. All of 10 L. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 L. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 L. mali strains, and 2 L. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. Among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different Lactobacillus species, the strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. parvus produced succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of L. alimentarius, L. collinoides, L. farciminis, L. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), L. malefermentans, and L. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. Diammonium citrate in de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. Production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. Succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. The present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
TI  - [Induction of interferon by Lactobacillus].
AB  
TI  - Detection of a Lactobacillus substance that inhibits Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. This interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. In the present study, Lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant Escherichia coli Hu 734 and E. coli ATCC 25922. The bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain GR-1 was retained under pH buffered conditions and was bactericidal. The bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. The data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. Human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the E. coli. The ability of L. casei GR-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
TI  - [Adjuvant activity of lactic bacteria: perspectives for its use in oral vaccines].
AB  - The effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was studied. The species of the genus Lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. The stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. The plaque-forming cells (PFC) and the circulating antibody titers to the SRBC antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control group. In mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria was stimulated. S. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. These results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. In this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.
TI  - Adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  - Yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (LAB) consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). These micro-organisms adhere to human T lymphocytes, and bind to B lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. In addition, a quantitative analysis of LAB binding to PBL was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a Salmonella model. The effect of yogurt LAB on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by PBL was examined. Lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. These findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt LAB to modulate the immune response.
TI  - Systemic augmentation of the immune response in mice by feeding fermented milks with Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - This study investigates the effect of feeding fermented milks with Lactobacillus  casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixture of both micro-organisms on the specific and non-specific host defence mechanisms in Swiss mice. Animals fed with fermented milk for 8 days (100 micrograms/day) showed an increase in both phagocytic and lymphocytic activity. This activation of the immune system began on the 3rd day, reached a maximum on the 5th, and decreased slightly on the 8th day of feeding. In the 8-day treated mice, boosted with a single dose (100 micrograms) on the 11th day, the immune response increased further. The feeding with fermented milk produced neither hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly. These results suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus, associated with intestinal mucosae, can influence the level of activation of the immune system. The possible clinical application of fermented milks as immunopotentiators is also discussed.
TI  - Enhancement of host resistance against Listeria infection by Lactobacillus casei: efficacy of cell wall preparation of Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Cell wall, cytoplasm, polysaccharide, and peptidoglycan fractions prepared from Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were examined for their efficacies to enhance resistance of host mice against Listeria monocytogenes infection. Intraperitoneal injections of those cellular fractions of L. casei led to elicitation of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity and the efficacy was highest in the case of peptidoglycan. Macrophage ratio in the resultant peritoneal exudate cells was also highest in mice given peptidoglycan. Macrophages induced with cell wall fraction of L. casei showed the most potent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-triggered respiratory burst (chemiluminescence and O2- production determined on the basis of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction) followed by those elicited with peptidoglycan. All the macrophages induced with cell wall of L. casei (two strains) and L. acidophilus enhanced O2- production in response to PMA but L. plantarum did not enhance O2(-)-producing ability in such a manner. The L. casei-cell wall also enhanced in vitro listericidal activity of mouse peritoneal macrophages, but such an activity was not noted in the case of L. acidophilus-cell wall. When mice were intravenously given the cellular fractions 7 or 13 days before L. monocytogenes infection, cell wall fractions of L. casei caused the most potent protective activity. A weak protective activity was also found in peptidoglycan of L. casei. Therefore, the protective action of L. casei against L. monocytogenes infection in host mice may be attributed to cell wall compounds and partially to the peptidoglycan moiety.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
TI  - Fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), peanut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were studied. The bacteria investigated were Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. During fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees C. Maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, pH, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. The maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in pH. Change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. Color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. In the extracts inoculated simultaneously with L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased pH in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. Fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotics on the adhesive properties of microorganisms and an available model for its study].
AB  - The effect of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, bicillin-3, carbenicillin, levomycetin, erythromycin, streptomycin and kanamycin on the adhesive properties of 9 test microbes including 5 strains of Lactobacillus from human microflora, 3 uropathornic strains of E. coli and 1 strain of S. aureus was studied with the method developed by the authors. The method is based on the use of formalinized human erythrocytes as macroorganism cells. It was shown that the antibiotic inhibitory effect on adhesion depended on mechanism of action of the antibiotics and their concentration, was associated with the level of the microbial adhesion and did not depend on the microbial sensitivity to the drugs.

TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus casei on Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in normal and  dexamethasone-treated mice.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of Lactobacillus casei YIT 0003 into normal or dexamethasone-treated mice led to nonspecific resistance against intraperitoneal challenge with lethal doses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 3047. The enhanced resistance was retained for 14 days (P less than 0.05) after injection with living L. casei. In contrast, the statistically significant duration of the enhanced resistance in mice treated intraperitoneally with living L. acidophilus YIT 0075 was only 5 days. The in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) against P. aeruginosa 5 and 7 days after intraperitoneal injection of living L. casei was significantly higher than in the case of PECs elicited by L. acidophilus. In the case of intravenous injection of heat-killed L. casei before intraperitoneal challenge with P. aeruginosa, there were no survivors in the late period after administration of L. casei. A high correlation existed between the patterns of in vivo killing of P. aeruginosa by PECs and survival rate of mice injected intravenously with heat-killed L. casei. The reduced in vivo killing activity of PECs from dexamethasone-treated mice against P. aeruginosa infection was also augmented by the intraperitoneal injection of heat-killed L. casei. These results indicate that L. casei possesses a resistance-enhancing capacity against P. aeruginosa infection in vivo. Differences in the duration of the enhanced resistance caused by L. casei and by L. acidophilus may be due to differences in chemical composition and/or physicochemical properties of the cell walls of the two kinds of bacteria.
TI  - In vitro adherence of Lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of Lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus isolated from three commercial yogurts were compared to L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. cellobiosus, and L. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from American Type Culture Collection cultures. L. acidophilus isolated from Lactinex tablets was also tested. No significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the American Type Culture Collection cultures, and the Lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any Lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Nucleic acids of species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named Lactobacillus species was studied. Nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic reactions. The overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 X 10(6) daltons. Sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 X 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus Bacillus. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees C below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. The genus can be divided into three major groups, each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. Group I (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. Group II (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus brevis, and Group III (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
TI  - Reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  - Germfree (GF) F344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis (BCG). Specific pathogene-free (SPF) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. The rats colonized with Escherichia coli or Bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in SPF rats. The rats colonized with Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus casei, L. fermentum, L. murini, and L. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in GF rats. Furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of E. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in SPF rats. These results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of SPF rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, P. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and E. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.
TI  - [Adhesive properties of lactobacilli isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract].
AB  - The adhesive and hemagglutinating properties of 34 tribes of Lactobacillus have been examined. 21 tribes came from human saliva and feces. 23.5% of the tribes showed strongly, 50% weakly adhesive properties. The remaining tribes showed average effects. Most of the strongly adhering tribes were isolates from human specimens. In the group of weakly adhering tribes those from collections dominated. 4 of 9 examined species differed in their adhering capacity. These were L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. casei, and L. fermentum. Only weakly adhering tribes showed hemagglutination of human erythrocytes. Therefore, there exists obviously, a reversed relation between the adhering and the hemagglutinating properties of Lactobacilli.
TI  - A Phylogenetic Analysis of Lactobacilli, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. brevis, L. plantarum, L.  ruminis, L. casei, L. bifermentans, L. viridescens, L. fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 S ribosomal RNAs. All Lactobacillus species investigated together with P. pentosaceus and L. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. L. acidophilus and L. helveticus is the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. Lactobacillus, together with Streptococcus and Bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of Gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.
TI  - Metabolism of pyruvate and citrate in lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii , L. lactis and L. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. The presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. L. casei and L. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while L. casei also produced diacetyl. L. casei and L. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. L. helveticus and L. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate under the conditions used.
TI  - [Bacteriocin typing of Lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  - Lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. L. acidophilus-L. salivarious, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. helveticus, L. lactis and L. leichmannii were used in the study. The cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. The method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. It allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. This may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome: an ecologic imbalance within the genital microflora of women?
AB  - Epidemiologic data suggested that toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may be caused by an  imbalance among the flora of the female genital tract. Since natural defense mechanisms often involve antagonistic interactions between the flora and potential pathogens, the ability of genital lactobacilli to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus was determined in agar overlay assays. Lactobacilli were chosen for study because previous investigations had suggested an important role for this genus in maintenance of health of the female genital tract. Fourteen of 50 strains of lactobacilli and Lactinex inhibited the growth of certain staphylococci, including strains from cases of TSS. The inhibitory activity of some lactobacilli was variable and could be enhanced by exogenously supplied substrates. Growth of one consistently inhibitory lactobacillus was inhibited by Staphylococcus aureus. A model for the etiology of toxic shock syndrome in menstruating women is proposed. The model includes antagonistic interactions between lactobacilli and staphylococci and the influence of tampons on these interactions to favor the staphylococcus.
TI  - [Bacteriocinogenic typing of lactobacilli].
AB  - Sensitivity of 588 strains of Lactobacilli belonging to 15 species was studied with respect to 39 bacteriocinogenic strains of Lactobacilli producing 39 variants of bacteriocins. The study provided a set of 20 indicator strains of Lactobacilli. With the use of this set it is possible to mark Lactobacilli of various species and differentiate them into 39 bacteriocinogenic types. This may be used in taxonomic and epidemiological studies.
TI  - [Sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus Thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  - Sensitivity of 278 cultures of Thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. It was shown that all cultures of L. Salivarius, L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of L. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. The cultures of L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
TI  - Multiple nutritional requirements of lactobacilli: genetic lesions affecting amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
AB  - Genetic lesions responsible for amino acid requirements in several species of multiple auxotrophic lactobacilli were investigated. Systematic attempts were made to isolate mutants that could grow in the absence of each of the amino acids required by the parental strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, L. casei, L. helveticus, and L. acidophilus. After treatment with appropriate mutagens, such mutants could be obtained with respect to many but not all required amino acids. Successful isolation of mutants for a given amino acid means that a minor genetic lesion reparable by single-step mutations affects its biosynthesis; a failure to isolate mutants suggests the involvement of more extensive lesions. Analysis of these results as well as the specific requirements exhibited by the parental strains revealed certain regularities; some of the biosynthetic pathways for individual amino acids were virtually unaffected by more extensive lesions in at least species tested, whereas others were affected by more extensive lesions in at least some species. Both the number and the kind of pathways affected by extensive lesions differed appreciably among different species. Furthermore, the growth response of the parental strains to some putative amino acid precursors revealed a clear correlation between the extent of genetic lesions and the occurrence and location of a genetic block(s) for a given pathway. These findings are discussed in relation to the phylogeny, ecology, and evolution of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on urinary indican excretion in gnotobiotic rats and in man.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (GBH-9 and GB-5) and in man was studied. L. salivarius, L. plantarum and L. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of L. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. Daily feeding of Lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of L. acidophilus. There was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. A significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. L. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. Reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. A negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). Subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.
TI  - Factors affecting the quaternary structure of the allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus curvatus as investigated by hybridization and ultracentrifugation.
AB  - The allosteric L-lactate dehydrogenases of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus casei exist in the tetrameric from (molecular weight about 145 000) at pH 5.0--5.5 even in the absence of the effectors Mn2+ and Fru(1,6)P2 (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), but undergo reversible dissociation to monomers (molecular weight about 35 000) at higher pH values or in the presence of urea. In the range between pH 5.5 (tetrameric state) and pH 7.4 (monomeric state) the L. curvatus L-lactate dehydrogenase exists in a dissociation-association equilibrium comprising tetramers, dimers and monomers as indicated by the Sc20,w values and the results of hybridization experiments. The simultaneous addition of both effectors [Mn2+ and Fru(1,6)P2] at pH 7.4, however, resulted in the stabilization of the tetrameric form. The addition of Fru(1,6)P2 alone at pH 7.4 had almost no influence on the quarternary structure, whereas the addition of Mn2+, as well as that of NADH, largely prevented dissociation. The L-lactate dehydrogenase of L. casei showed similar properties, although the enzyme dissociates only at about pH greater than or equal to 7.8. As in the case of the L. curvatus enzyme, Fru(1,6)P2 has no influence on the pH-dependent dissociation of the L. casei enzyme, whereas Mn2+ stabilizes the tetrameric structure. Reconstitution of a mixture of the two dissociated enzymes results in the formation of all statistically possible, enzymatically active hybrids. No hybridization between the allosteric enzymes from L. casei and L. curvatus and the non-allosteric ones of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus was observed.
TI  - In vitro studies on distribution of indigenous lactobacilli of the gastrointestinal tract of rats.
AB  - To learn the biochemical mechanisms controlling the distribution of indigenous lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats, the effect of pH and stomach and cecal contents on lactobacillus distribution was investigated in vitro with a mixed culture of three lactobacillus strains isolated from the rat intestine. The pH of the growth medium affected the growth of lactobacilli strongly, irrespective of the lumenal contents. Lactobacillus fermentum outnumbered L. acidophilus and L. murini at low pH (PH 4.5; average pH of stomach contents of conventional rats) but at near neutral pH (pH 6.5; average pH of cecal contents of conventional rats), the growth of L. murini was predominant with all strains. More lactic acid was formed by lactobacilli in medium consisting of stomach contents than in cecal contents medium. L. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction of the stomach contents and L. fermentum grew in the dialyzable fraction, but L. acidophilus did not grow in either fraction. L. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction treated with hyaluronidase. In contrast, the nondialyzable fraction treated with pronase or chondroitinase did not allow L. murini to grow at all.

TI  - [The microflora of sour dough. IV. Communication: bacterial composition of sourdough starters genus Lactobacillus beijerinck (author's transl)].
AB  - The bacterial composition of three so called pure culture sourdough starters of varying origin was investigated. 245 isolates were obtained all belonging to the genus Beijerinck. According to their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics they were classified into the subgroups: Thermobacterium (L. acidophilus), Streptobacterium (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. farciminis, L. alimentarius) and Betabacterium (L. brevis, L. brevis var. lindneri, L buchneri, L. fermentum, L. fructi vorans). In the three sourdough starters the identified lactic organisms varied in number and proportion. In starter preparation "A" only the varieties L. fructi vorans and L. fermentum were present. Preparation "B" contained a great variety of microorganisms with L. brevis and L. brevis L. lindneri predominating. In starter "C" L. brevis, L. plantarum and L. alimentarius predominated.
TI  - Comparative studies of lactate dehydrogenases in lactic acid bacteria. Amino-acid composition of an active-site region and chemical properties of the L-lactate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - The molecular weight, the amino acid composition and the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acids of two allosteric (Lactobacillus casei, L. curvatus) and two non-allosteric (L. plantarum, L. acidophilus) L-lactate dehydrogenases, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, were determined. The amino acid composition of the only tryptic peptide unequivocally common to the fingerprints of the 4 enzymes is virtually identical with that of the arginine peptide, called Arg6 of the the substratebinding site of the L-lactate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase of several animals. However, the 'essential' cysteine residue 165 is replaced by threonine, as it is in the L-lactate dehydrogenase of lobster. In addition, the 4 bacterial peptides differ by one or two changes in single amino acid residues from each other as well as from those of animals. The data indicate that not only the animal L-lactate dehydrogenases, but also the allosteric and lactate dehydrogenases from bacterial sources may have evolved from a common gene.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacillus species normally found in the intestinal tract of humans varied in  the ability to deconjugate bile acids, whereas laboratory strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus deconjugated both glycocholate and taurocholate. All isolates of L. acidophilus from human feces deconjugated taurocholate, whereas only one of six deconjugated glycocholate. None of 13 isolates identified as L. casei deconjugated taurocholate, whereas 9 deconjugated glycocholate. The deconjugating system of L. acidophilus appeared to be constitutive, required low oxidation-reduction potential, and was most active at pH 6. No degradation beyond deconjugation was detected.
TI  - [Sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus Streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
AB  - Sensitivity of 167 cultures of Lactobacilli of Streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. jugurti, L. salivarius, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermenti, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied. It was found that the cultures of L. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of L. casei and all cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by Lactobacilli of different species.

TI  - [The fecal flora of man. III. Communication: The composition of Lactobacillus flora of different age groups (author's transl)].
AB  - From fecal flora of 66 infants aged 3 to 220 days, 29 children aged 4 to 6 years, 42 adults aged 20 to 64 years and 21 senile persons aged 65 to 86 years, the Lactobacillus flora was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. In the feces of babies only the resident lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. fermenti) were found, while in the feces of children, adults and senile persons the resident lactobacilli as well as the transient lactobacilli (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. lactis) were found simultaneously. Within the Lactobacillus species L. acidophilus type I, L. fermenti type IVa and L. salivarius type Ia were most frequently found in the feces of all age groups. In addition, L. acidophilus type X was also often found in the feces of senile persons. In connection with the numbers of species or types of lactobacilli in one fecal specimen, one or two species or types were demonstrated in 94,5% of positive cases of infants. With increasing age the numbers increased, especially more than three species or types were demonstrated in 85% of positive cases. In infants in 3 different clinics, clinic-specificities were demonstrated in relation to the species or types of lactobacilli isolated: in each clinic clearly certain species or types of lactobacilli were present. The results indicate that the composition of the Lactobacillus flora in the feces is influenced by lactobacilli orally ingested.
TI  - [Ability of lactobacilli in the human microflora to produce lysozyme].
AB  - Lysozyme activity of 403 strains of lactobacilli were investigated; of these 26 were from foreign sets and 377 were isolated from the contents of the stomach, feces and vaginal discharge of healthy adults. The species reference of lactobacillae was confirmed by the results of study of their physiologo-biochemical properties with the aid of 45 tests. A method of agar plates was adapted to determination of lysozyme: the autoclaved suspension of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (strain No. 2665) was added to the agar medium MPC-I, and lactobacilli were cultivated for 4 days in the CO2 atmosphere at 37 degrees C. There was revealed the capacity of L. fermenti and L. brevis to produce lysozyme; in L. fermenti the lysozyme activity was much more frequent (p less than 0.001); strains of the rest of the species of lactobacilli differentiated by the Rogosa and Sharpe's classification proved to be lysozyme-negative. It was shown that the lactobacilli of the L. fermenti species, included into the microflora of the intestine and the vagina of healthy adults as a rule possessed lysozyme activity. L. fermenti strain 90T-S4 used in the production of dry lactobacterin also produced lysozyme. All this favours an important role of L. fermenti in the protective function of the microflora.

AB  - Hattori, H. (Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), H. Misawa, I. Igarashi, and Y. Sugiya. Effects of lactic acid-forming bacteria on Vibrio comma inoculated into intestinal segments of rabbits. J. Bacteriol. 90:541-545. 1965.-Mixed inocula of Vibrio comma KC-4 and various lactic acid-forming bacteria were injected into the intestinal segments of rabbits (De and Chatterje, 1953) to observe the effects of the latter agents in altering the changes produced by strain KC-4. The animals were sacrificed 10 and 20 hr after inoculation. The inoculated intestinal segments were first examined grossly, and the amount of exudate in the segments, if any, was measured, after which the tissues were subjected to pathological examination. When KC-4 cells together with spore-bearing lactic acid-forming bacilli, strain P-22, or Lactobacillus casei were introduced, the intestinal segments showed few or no macroscopic and microscopic changes, and no accumulation of exudate. With mixed inoculation with lactic acid bacteria such as L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus lactis, and S. faecalis, changes were produced by strain KC-4. Macroscopically, no difference was discernible between the changes caused by mixed inoculation and those produced by single inoculation of KC-4. Upon pathological examination, however, it was seen that changes resulting from mixed inoculation were slightly less severe than those produced by inoculation with strain KC-4 only.
TI  - Factors which increase acid production in milk by lactobacilli.
AB  - The stimulation by yeast extract of acid production in milk by various lactobacilli was studied. It was found that supplementing milk with purine and pyrimidine bases and amino acids allowed nearly maximal acid production by Lactobacillus bulgaricus strain 7994, L. acidophilus 4796, 4356, and 4357, and L. leichmannii 326 and 327. Further supplementation with deoxyribotides allowed maximal acid production by L. acidophilus 204, but L. acidophilus 207 required adenosine or adenylic acid. L. casei strain 7469 showed no appreciable response to the amino acids or purine and pyrimidine bases, and is presumed to require an unidentified factor in corn steep liquor.
