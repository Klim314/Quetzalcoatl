TI  == cellular fatty acid composition as an adjunct to the identification of asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods.
AB  == cellular fatty acid (cfa) compositions of 561 asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as an adjunct to their identification when grown on blood agar at 35 degrees c. the organisms could be divided into two groups. in the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform cdc groups a-3, a-4, and a-5; some strains of b-1 and b-3; "corynebacterium aquaticum"; brevibacterium liquefaciens; rothia dentocariosa; and listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (ca15:0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (ca17:0) acids. other species with these types  of cfa included b. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (ci13:0) and anteisotridecanoic (ca13:0) acids. cfas useful for distinguishing among jonesia denitrificans, oerskovia spp., some strains of cdc groups b-1 and b-3, kurthia spp., and propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (c 16:0) acid,  isopentadecanoic (ci15:0) acid, and ca15:0). the second group (straight-chained type), which included actinomyces pyogenes; arcanobacterium haemolyticum; c. bovis; c. cystitidis; c. diphtheriae; c. flavescens, "c. gentalium"; c. jeikeium; c. kutscheri; c. matruchotii; c .minutissimum; c. mycetoides; c. pilosum; c. pseudodiphtheriticum; "c. pseudogenitalium"; c. pseudotuberculosis; c. renale; cdc groups 1, 2, anf-1, d-2, e, f-1, f-2, g-1, g-2, and i-2; c. striatum; "c. tuberculostearicum"; c. ulcerans; c. vitarumen; c. xerosis; and erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, was typified by significant quantities of hexadecanoic (c16:0) and oleic acids (c18:cis9), with differences in the amounts of linoleic acid (c18:2), stearic acid (c18:0), an unnamed peak (equivalent chain length, 14.966), and small quantities of other known saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. cfa composition of these organisms was sufficiently discriminatory to assist in classification but could not be used as the sole means of identification.

TI  == a numerical taxonomic study of members of the actinomycetaceae and related taxa.
AB  == two hundred and twenty-two representatives of the actinomycetaceae and related taxa, including reference cultures, received strains and fresh isolates, were tested using 124 unit characters. the data were examined using numerical taxonomic techniques with various coefficients and average linkage clustering; the variation in composition of the clusters obtained from the different coefficients was slight. most species included in the study formed discrete phena, which exhibited good differential characters. actinomyces israelii was particularly well-defined and a. naeslundii and a. viscosus, although grouping together, did show divergence in several test results. actinomyces bovis was initially linked with representatives of genera other than actinomyces, these being bifidobacterium, corynebacterium pyogenes and erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. the strains of bacterionema matruchotii and rothia dentocariosa formed tight distinct clusters associated only at low similarity levels with other members of  the family actinomycetaceae. the arachnia propionica phenon, although well-defined, appeared to consist of two subclusters which could be assigned to serotypes 1 and 2. tests which may be useful in identification are tabulated and  the relationships between the various taxa are discussed.

TI  == aerobic gram-positive pleomorphic rods isolated from dental plaque and gingival crevice.
AB  == a typical gram-positive pleomorphic aerobe is rothia dentocariosa. however, there exist many organisms having similar characteristics (rothia-like organisms). the  purpose of this study is to isolate rothia dentocariosa and rothia-like organisms from the healthy and diseased sites of the oral cavity and to clarify the characteristics of those organisms. a total of 342 strains were isolated in this  study, and 188 strains were identified as gram-positive pleomorphic rods. seventy-seven typical strains of 188 isolates were examined physiologically and biochemically, and they were classified as follows: 1) 20 strains of a. viscosus; 2) 3 strains of a. naeslundii; 3) 26 strains of rothia dentocariosa; 4) 2 strains of bacterionema matruchotii; 5) 15 strains of corynebacterium; 6) 7 strains of nocardia; and 4 unknown strains. the strains of rothia dentocariosa were mainly isolated from the dental plaque (24 of 26 isolates), and they had the ability to  adhere on to the glass surface, and 5 of 26 strains of rothia dentocariosa showed the ability of gelatin liquefaction.
