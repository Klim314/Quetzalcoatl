TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == bacteria of dental caries in primary and permanent teeth in children and young adults.
AB  == although streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a major etiological agent of dental caries, our cross-sectional preliminary study indicated that 10% of subjects with rampant caries in permanent teeth do not have detectable levels of  s. mutans. our aims were to use molecular methods to detect all bacterial species associated with caries in primary and permanent teeth and to determine the bacterial profiles associated with different disease states. plaque was collected from 39 healthy controls and from intact enamel and white-spot lesions, dentin lesions, and deep-dentin lesions in each of 51 subjects with severe caries. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identities. in a reverse-capture checkerboard assay, 243 samples were analyzed for 110 prevalent bacterial species. a sequencing analysis of 1,285 16s rrna clones detected 197 bacterial species/phylotypes, of which 50% were not cultivable. twenty-two new phylotypes were identified. proc mixed tests revealed  health- and disease-associated species. in subjects with s. mutans, additional species, e.g., species of the genera atopobium, propionibacterium, and lactobacillus, were present at significantly higher levels than those of s. mutans. lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium dentium, and low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in subjects with no detectable s. mutans. actinomyces spp. and non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in white-spot lesions, while known acid producers were found at their highest levels later in disease. bacterial profiles change with disease states and differ between primary and secondary dentitions. bacterial species other than s. mutans, e.g., species of the genera veillonella, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and propionibacterium, low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp., and atopobium spp., likely play important roles in caries progression.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin rp 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and rp 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included  for oral streptococci). all compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against gram-positive anaerobes, including actinomyces spp., propionibacterium spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium dentium. azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. in general, rp 59500 had higher mics than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at  2 mg/l. azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the gram-negative anaerobes: fusobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., wolinella spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, selenomonas spp. and mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most gram-negative species, but was superior against capnocytophaga ochraceus and eikenella corrodens. rp 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against fusobacterium spp. and leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were  moderately resistant to erythromycin. the macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas rp 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. the in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. rp 59500 showed useful activity against gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
