TI  == screened butanol-tolerant enterococcus faecium capable of butanol production.
AB  == due to the complex mechanisms involved in butanol-induced stress response, butanol tolerance phenotype is difficult to engineer even in microorganisms with  well-defined genetic backgrounds. we therefore aimed to isolate butanol-tolerant  microorganisms from environmental samples as potential alternative hosts for butanol production. soil samples collected were subjected to butanol stress. a microbial strain capable of 2.5-3 % (w/v) butanol tolerance was isolated and identified as enterococcus faecium by 16s rdna analysis. the isolate grew readily under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and was capable of producing butanol  anaerobically. in comparison with the obligate anaerobe clostridium acetobutylicum, the growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions of the isolated strain, together with no detection of butyrate and lack of two-phase fermentation suggests different metabolic networks from the obligate anaerobe c.  acetobutylicum. under anaerobic condition, butanol reached up to 0.4 gl(-1) in a  batch culture without heterologous introduction of butanol biosynthetic pathway.  besides butanol tolerance, the isolated e. faecium ib1 showed high tolerance to 10 % (w/v) ethanol and 3 % (w/v) isobutanol. with distinct features including high butanol tolerance and natural butanol production, the isolated e. faecium ib1 with minimum metabolic engineering can be explored as a potential host for butanol production.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of pentose utilisation systems in the bacillus/clostridium group of bacteria.
AB  == in bacillus subtilis, utilisation of xylose, arabinose and ribose is controlled by the transcriptional factors xylr, arar and rbsr, respectively. here we apply the comparative approach to the analysis of these regulons in the bacillus/clostridium group. evolutionary variability of operon structures is demonstrated and operator sites for the main transcription factors are predicted. the consensus sequences for the xylr and rbsr binding sites vary in different subgroups of genomes. the functional coupling of gene clusters and the conservation of regulatory sites allow for detection of non-orthologous gene displacement of ribulose kinase in enterococcus faecium and clostridium acetobutylicum. moreover, candidate catabolite responsive elements found upstream of most pentose-utilising genes suggest ccpa-mediated catabolite repression.
