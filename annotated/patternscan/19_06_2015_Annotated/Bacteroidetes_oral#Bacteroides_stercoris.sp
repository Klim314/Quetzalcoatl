TI  == characterization of a bacteroides species from human intestine that degrades glycosaminoglycans.
AB  == polysaccharide lyases that can degrade glycosaminoglycans (gags) were identified  in an anaerobic strain living in the human intestine. the strain was isolated from the stool of a healthy male and identified as bacteroides sp. strain hj-15.  a detailed taxonomical study indicated the species is a strain of bacteroides stercoris. the isolate was cultured and the polysaccharide lyase activity was partially purified. this enzyme preparation could act on gags containing either glucosamine or galactosamine suggesting the presence of both heparinases and chondroitinases. various gags were incubated with the partially purified enzyme and the products formed were analyzed by strong anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. these studies demonstrated the presence of at least two types of polysaccharide lyases: heparin lyase and chondroitin sulfate lyase. the eliminative mechanism of these lyase enzymes was confirmed through the isolation of unsaturated disaccharide products. the heparin lyase acted on both heparin and acharan sulfate, a gag recently isolated from achatina fulica. the bacteroides chondroitin lyase, acted  on chondroitin sulfates a, b (dermatan sulfate), and c, resembling chondroitin lyase abc. the presence of a gag-degrading organism in human intestine may pose problems for the effective oral administration of gag drugs.

TI  == prevotella, a new genus to include bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus bacteroides.
AB  == it was recently proposed that the genus bacteroides should be restricted to bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b. stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and b. vulgatus). by contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral bacteroides species, which include b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, prevotella. the type species is prevotella melaninogenica.
